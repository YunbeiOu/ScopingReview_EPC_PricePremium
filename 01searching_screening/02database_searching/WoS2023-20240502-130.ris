TI  - A new framework to disentangle the impact of changes in dwelling characteristics on house price indices
T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - While house price indices aim to measure the change in price of an identical dwelling over time, many are unable to sufficiently control for changes in the quality of the houses sold. This change in quality is a known, but rarely measured, factor. Our paper proposes a new framework to disentangle and quantify the contribution of each individual dwelling characteristic to the quality change. It can be applied to many frequently used hedonic house price indices and allows for non-linear, time-varying price premia for the various dwelling characteristics. Using data from Belgium for 2011 Q3 -2021 Q2, we found that the quality of the houses sold increased substantially, mostly due to improvements in energy efficiency. As energy performance will continue to improve to meet European climate goals, statistical agencies should incorporate it into the construction of their house price indices in order to avoid overestimating price growth.

TI  - How prebound effects compromise the market premium for energy efficiency in German house sales
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies indicate that houses with higher energy efficiency usually have higher market prices, a 'market premium for energy efficiency'. But in Germany the usefulness of this premium is confounded by the 'prebound effect': the gap between officially certificated energy ratings and actual energy consumption. Attempts have been made to close this gap from two complementary directions: downwards, by obtaining more accurate and less pessimistic technical estimates of idealised energy performance; and upwards, by estimating how much energy occupants realistically need for health and comfort. This study investigates prebound effects alongside an analysis of house prices in Germany, using a large database of house sale advertisements from 2007 to 2021, focusing on pre-1980 homes that were re-sold in 2019-2021. It uses ordinary least-squared multivariate regression to estimate market premiums for energy efficiency and sets these alongside estimates of prebound (and rebound) effects. It finds that prebound effects can lead purchasers to overestimate future energy savings and therefore pay more for properties than their actual worth. It also offers simple models to help purchasers interpret energy ratings more critically and estimate likely energy savings more realistically. Finally, it suggests how policymakers could modify energy ratings to reflect likely energy consumption more accurately.

TI  - Subsidies or green taxes? Evaluating the distributional effects of housing renovation policies among Dutch households
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Despite persistent housing affordability issues, energy policy and housing renovation are usually investigated separately from housing costs other than energy. Researchers have examined the financial viability of renovation attending to building conditions and the socio-economic characteristics of their occupants. However, the distributional impacts of renovation incentives and the potential of fiscal policy to redistribute housing costs remain understudied. Dutch fiscal policy, favouring homeownership, offers a relevant context to evaluate how property taxation can boost renovation rates. The novelty of this paper resides in investigating the impact of two policies, the current direct subsidy and a proposal for a green tax, on both the financial viability of renovation and the subsequent distribution of housing costs. The proposed green tax combines energy efficiency and taxation of property revenue. We employ a model considering marginal costs of housing renovation, obtained from a government dataset, and marginal benefits, drawn from a hedonic regression. We assess the distributional impacts of different policy scenarios by examining changes in user costs across income deciles. Our findings indicate that existing renovation subsidies exacerbate the regressive distributional impacts resulting from the current housing taxation system in the Netherlands. Introducing energy-efficiency-linked property taxation can make homeownership fiscality less regressive while incentivising housing renovation. Ultimately, this study highlights the importance of incorporating housing affordability as a fundamental element in renovation policies to balance environmental and distributional objectives.

TI  - Does district heating affect residential property prices? Case study of an urban area in South Korea
T2  - UTILITIES POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates whether the residential heating method affects property prices in an urban area of South Korea. Sales data for 1760 apartments in Seocho District, Seoul, the country's capital, are employed. The property price equation is estimated, including the heating method as one attribute. The gap between the price of properties with a district heating system (DHS) and those with other heating methods, such as an individual heating system or central heating system, accounted for about 21.7% of apartment prices. Specifically, apart-ments with a DHS were more expensive than apartments with other heating methods.

TI  - HOW DO HOUSING PRICES AFFECT A CITY'S INNOVATION CAPACITY? THE CASE OF CHINA
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using panel data from 269 Chinese cities, this study examined the impact of housing prices (HP) on cities' innovation capacity (IC) in China. Firstly, a fixed effect model was used to analyze the effect of HP on cities' IC in China, revealing that HP positively impacts cities' IC. Next, several robustness tests were conducted to verify the finding's reliability. Thirdly, the analysis empirically tested mediating mechanisms between HP and cities' IC in China. The results show that, on the one hand, higher HP can improve cities' IC by attracting talents and stimulating the growth of local fiscal revenue. On the other, increasing HP can inhibit cities' IC in China by attracting funds into the real estate market and impeding residents' consumption ability. Finally, the heterogeneous nature of the HP-IC link in China was further explored. This study's results provide recommendations for the government of China on how to promote cities' innovation performance.

TI  - How Does Mandatory Energy Efficiency Disclosure Affect Housing Prices?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2012, the United States has witnessed explosive growth in mandatory energy efficiency disclosure policies, which aim to address market failures in housing. I examine one such policy and find increased capitalization of features that buyers are less likely to observe, but no impacts for features that buyers usually observe. A standard deviation increase in less-observable energy efficiency corresponds to a $5,300 increase in house prices. A dollar of annual savings from less observable energy efficiency is associated with a $19 increase in house prices due to the policy. This translates to none-to-full capitalization of less-observable energy efficiency at discount rates upward of 5.6%. My findings suggest that policy makers can reduce administrative burdens by targeting disclosure of less observable energy efficiency features. Furthermore, my findings call into question the usefulness of common instruments like the Home Energy Score for disclosure policies, as these mostly provide information on more observable features.

TI  - Does the energy efficiency of buildings bring price premiums? Evidence from urban micro-level energy data
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy efficient buildings can facilitate the achievement of sustainable development goals. However, higher investment costs are not conducive to the development of energy efficient buildings. It is not clear whether the energy efficiency of buildings (EEBs) bring price premiums that could offset the incremental costs of adopting green practice. In this paper, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is constructed that takes into account the differences in regional and urban size to measure the EEBs in 54 cities of China during 2007-2018. We evaluate the influence of EEBs on price premiums by using fixed effects regression. We then adopt a moderated mediation model to explore the impact of industrial structure and the regional economic development level on this pre-mium effect. The empirical results show that the cities' EEBs is gradually improving, due to the fact that the level of technical progress in residential construction is rising. A 1% increase in house energy efficiency causes price premiums of 0.583%. Moreover, this premium effect is more obvious in cities with a high proportion of tertiary industries and economically developed areas. Considering energy consumption in household heating, the housing prices expectations were pulled down in heating cities, while the situation was reversed in non-heating cities. This study provides companies and governments with scientific evidence to promote EEBs.

TI  - How Does the Presentation of Energy Performance Affect the Price of Houses? A Case Study of Detached Houses in Stockholm, Sweden
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study aims to analyse whether the capitalisation of a property's energy performance is affected by how it is presented. In place since 2002, there is an EU directive mandating the introduction of an energy performance certificate (EPC) when selling detached houses. This directive was implemented in Sweden in 2009. We analyse how EPC capitalised on housing prices during 2012-2018 for detached houses in Stockholm. This was previously carried out, but our contribution is to analyse both the effect of energy rating or labelling (A-G) and energy consumption (kWh/m(2)). How energy performance is communicated or displayed to potential buyers conveys that the format, style, and content of energy performance information may influence how buyers perceive its value and impact on the property's market price. We have information on energy rating, consumption, or both for selected properties. This allows us to test the hypothesis that how energy performance is presented affects pricing. We also tested whether information affects different age cohorts differently. The results indicate that how energy performance is presented and visualised is important and that information about rating and consumption might be considered as a substitute for each other. It is also clear that the capitalisation effect differs depending on the age of the building.

TI  - LEED and BREEAM Green Building Certification Systems as Possible Game Changers in Attaining Low-Cost Energy-Efficient Urban Housing Projects
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research study is to illustrate the role of the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) and Leadership in Energy and Design (LEED) within low-cost urban housing projects through the analysis of multiple factors and motivations impacting the outcome of construction projects. The rate at which climate change is advancing demands that the construction industry change their practices to decrease the natural resources it consumes as well as improve the environmental efficiency of the world's building stock. The introduction of BREEAM and LEED in 1990 and 2000, respectively, provided a system where buildings are evaluated on their energy performance. Issues, however, began to develop as research that illustrated the system's drawbacks undermined its utility. In turn, the role of the green building certifications ought to be researched so that policy and stakeholder communication frameworks can be developed by contractors and designers to ensure the success of BREEAM and LEED projects. The research study was completed through a literature study of prior research as well as by the publishing of a snowball sampling-based survey questionnaire undertaken between practitioners, architects, engineers as well as researchers involved in the UK construction industry. The results of the survey were then collated using IBM's Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) and then a confirmatory factor analysis as well as a correlation matrix was completed. The confirmatory factor analysis illustrated that the two most important factors were climate change and quality. Thus, contractors and designers ought to develop practical policies and stakeholder frameworks to achieve value for money for the market demographic. The results of this study hold potential to increase the application of BREEAM and LEED. The improvement of practice in low-cost urban housing projects will improve the accessibility of BREEAM and LEED housing projects and, in turn, the energy efficiency and sustainability of new building stock.

Our review of physical risks includes price, loan performance, and migratory effects stemming from flooding, wildfires, and sea level rise. We review transition risks, including energy use and decarbonization, as they relate to real estate. Where possible, we explain how these topics may intersect with housing affordability, especially in historically disadvantaged communities. We conclude by highlighting critical areas for future research.

TI  - Energy storage by improving energy-efficiency of electricity home appliances under governmental supporting policies: A game-theoretic approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a supply chain is considered including the government, a monopolistic supplier, two manufacturers, two agencies, and customers. The manufacturers produce two substitutable electricity home appliances, i.e., energy-efficient and inefficient products, and sell them to customers via their agencies. The supplier provides industrial and household energies for the manufacturers and customers, respectively. The government sets the tax rates to the members and customers. Furthermore, it promotes the energy-efficient product by lowering the tax rates levied on its manufacturer and agency. In return, the customers' demands for both products are determined based on the selling prices to customers, the household energy consumption costs, and the efficiency rate of the energy-efficient product. Then, the game-theoretic frameworks are applied to make decisions under various competitive scenarios and different power structures. Finally, decisions are discussed and several insights are revealed. It is concluded that Nash game leads to higher utilities achieved by the government and customers. The government and customers' utilities increase by supporting the energy-efficient product. The members and government benefit from increasing the efficiency rate of the energy-efficient product. Moreover, from the whole system's perspective, it is preferable to reduce the tax rate imposed by the government on the members.

TI  - How the single-family residence housing market capitalizes green property upgraded features: evidence from city of Austin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeBy comparing regression models, this study aims to analyze the added home value of green sustainability features and green efficiency characteristics, rather than green certifications, in the city of Austin.Design/methodology/approachThe adoption of home green energy efficiency upgrades has emerged as a new trend in the real estate industry, offering several benefits to builders and home buyers. These include tax reductions, health improvements and energy savings. Previous studies have shown that energy-certified single-family homes command a premium in the marketplace. However, the literature is limited in its analysis of the effects of green upgrades and certification on different types of single-family homes. To address this gap, this research collected data from 21,292 multiple listing services (MLS) closed home-selling listings in Austin, Texas, over a period of 35 months.FindingsThe analysis results showed that green efficiency features could generally increase single-family housing prices by 11.9%, whereas green sustainability upgrades can potentially bring a 11.7% higher selling price. Although green housing certification did not have significant effects on most housing groups, it did increase closing prices by 13.2% for single-family residences sold at the medium price range, which is higher than the impacts from simply listing the green features on MLS.Originality/valueThe study contributes to the body of knowledge by examining the market value of broadly defined energy efficiency and sustainability features in the residential housing market. The findings can help policymakers, brokerage firms, home builders and owners adjust their policies and strategies related to single-family home sales and mortgage approvals. The research also highlights the potential benefits of capitalizing on green housing features other than certifications.

TI  - The willingness of social housing tenants to participate in natural gas-free heating systems project: Insights from a stated choice experiment in the Netherlands
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main tools to achieve the promise of carbon neutrality is the energy transition. Reducing dependence on traditional energy and promoting the use of renewable energy drives changes in the energy sector and contributes to the energy transition. The building sector is strongly linked to energy consumption and retrofitting the building sector with natural gas energy is a positive energy efficiency strategy. This research aimed to determine the factors influencing social housing tenants in the Netherlands to participate in retrofits and to identify the differences among participants in their preferences. Using a stated choice experiment and discrete choice model, 380 effective social housing tenants in the Netherlands participated. The estimated Mixed Logit Model (MLM) reveals the preferences of social housing residents, and the Latent Class Model (LCM) indicates differences between latent groups. The results show that social housing residents are attracted by saving total housing costs, enhancing living comfort, providing a new bathroom, kitchen and toilet of individual houses and improving the neighbourhood environment. Meanwhile, they are resistant to the interference generated during the renovation process. These findings can be used to guide government and housing organisations in developing retrofit programs that align with the needs and preferences of social housing tenants.

TI  - Stranded houses? The price effect of a minimum energy efficiency standard
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions can lead to decreases in the values of assets, risking them to become "stranded". We study the price effects of the introduction of a specific climate policy, a minimum energy efficiency standard, in the housing market. Leveraging a unique data set of the population of all residential house transactions in England and Wales, we show that prices of energy-inefficient properties affected by this policy decreased on average by about 5k pound to 9k pound relative to efficient ones. We interpret this evidence as being consistent with semi-strong market efficiency in the housing market.

TI  - Higher total energy costs strain the elderly, especially low-income, across 31 developed countries.
T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Addressing the total energy cost burden of elderly people is essential for designing equitable and effective energy policies, especially in responding to energy crisis in an aging society. It is due to the double impact of energy price hikes on households-through direct impact on fuel bills and indirect impact on the prices of goods and services consumed. However, while examining the household energy cost burden of the elderly, their indirect energy consumption and associated cost burden remain poorly understood. This study quantifies and compares the direct and indirect energy footprints and associated total energy cost burdens for different age groups across 31 developed countries. It reveals that the elderly have larger per capita energy footprints, resulting from higher levels of both direct and indirect energy consumption compared with the younger age groups. More importantly, the elderly, especially the low-income elderly, have a higher total energy cost burden rate. As the share of elderly in the total population rapidly grows in these countries, the larger per capita energy footprint and associated cost burden rate of elderly people would make these aging countries more vulnerable in times of energy crises. It is therefore crucial to develop policies that aim to reduce energy consumption and costs, improve energy efficiency, and support low-income elderly populations. Such policies are necessary to reduce the vulnerability of these aging countries to the energy crisis.

TI  - Comparative assessment of heat recovery from treated wastewater in the district heating systems of the three capitals of the Baltic countries
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban cities have a great potential for the sewage wastewater (WW) and treated WW but this heat resource is still underutilised in many European cities, including the three Baltic capitals of Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the integration of waste heat (WH) into a district heating (DH) system via absorption heat pumps by using key performance indicators (KPIs) in the fields of energy, environment, economy and social sphere in the three Baltic capitals. The paper presents a three-step methodology that develops an innovative multi-dimensional approach to energy poverty analysis and includes the three main drivers of energy poverty: fuel prices, household income, and energy efficiency. The paper shows that the integration of WH is economically feasible from the consumer's point of view and reduces energy poverty, especially when the price of fuel increases.

TI  - Theoretical cost and energy optimisation of a 4th generation net-zero district heating system with different thermal energy storage technologies.
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A model was used to simulate and optimise a speculative district heating (DH) system for an existing urban area in Loughborough, UK. Heat was supplied using only renewable heat sources (RHS) with long and short duration thermal energy storage (TES) systems used to address mismatch between heat generation and demand. For an 18month simulation period, a) building heat loads, b) heat generated, c) heat flow to and from stores, and d), heat losses from the stores and network were calculated using hourly weather data, network and building characteristics. RHS included evacuated-tube solar thermal collectors (ETSTCs), and ground and air source heat pumps powered by electricity generated by solar-photovoltaic (PV) and Wind turbines (Wind). The effect of long-term TES system volume and charging temperature on the calculated DH system cost per dwelling, and the calculated DH system energy efficiency was assessed. The minimum cost of the DH system was obtained by modifying the capacity of installed Wind and PV, while ensuring that heat demands were met in every hour of the simulation. A minimum cost per dwelling of 12,278 pound was predicted with an energy efficiency of 84.84 % for a long term TES volume of 15,000 m3 and temperature of 60 degrees C.

TI  - Does the market value energy efficiency within EPC-labels? An analysis of the residential real estate market in Flanders
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThe current literature has not investigated the perceived value of energy efficiency by households, regardless of financial benefits. Furthermore, there is a severe lack of research that investigates the effectiveness of the current format of EPC-labels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: to study how households value energy efficiency in the housing market, regardless of price effects.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses multiple hedonic regression models to analyse 706,778 Flemish properties for sale or rent between 2019 and 2023. The data is provided by Immoweb - the largest online real estate platform in Belgium. Given that the selling market is driven by different mechanisms than the rental market, the data set was divided in sold (522,164 listings) and rented properties (184,614 listings).FindingsThe ambiguous results of the A-label in the selling market indicate that the "class evaluation effect" found in related markets which use labels (e.g. household appliances) is also present in the housing market. However, the results of the other (lower) labels clearly show that owners do value energy improvements within labels, and this effect becomes stronger as the EPC-label becomes better. The rental market shows the opposite results. Energy improvements are only valued if they translate into a financial benefit. Taking these findings into account, the second part of this research shows that rescaling the EPC-label creates an incentive for improvements within labels.Originality/valueThis paper provides novel insights by studying the perceived value of energy efficiency in the absence of financial benefits and critically studying the effectiveness of the EPC-labels in their current shape. By investigating both the sales and rental market, the authors are able to make a comparison which creates valuable insights for academia, governments and real estate professionals.

TI  - Making embodied carbon mainstream: a framework for cities to leverage waste, equity, and preservation policy to reduce embodied emissions in buildings
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With anticipation building around embodied carbon as a "new frontier" of climate policy, it may appear that cities need to develop a whole suite of dedicated institutions and mechanisms to support its implementation. However, to do so risks placing an undue burden on already overstretched local and regional governments. Instead, embodied carbon policy can build on existing priorities that already galvanize resources and attention and have benefited from decades of policy development. Making strong links to a larger urban agenda offers a way to forge buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders. Current visions for embodied carbon policy broadly fall into two categories: (1) material substitution strategies, or technical solutions that incrementally reduce emissions, and (2) demand reduction strategies, more transformative solutions that avoid emissions. Both of these areas have strong ties to existing urban strategies for waste, equity, and preservation. Foundations in waste policy include increasing waste diversion, expanding green demolition, and increasing material efficiencies. Foundations in equity-oriented policy include retrofitting affordable housing, workforce development for deconstruction, and building lower carbon, lower cost housing. Foundations in preservation policy include incentivizing building reuse, supporting the use of low carbon materials for retrofits, and encouraging vertical infill. Amplifying existing policy efforts can bring substantive embodied carbon reductions to the forefront, leapfrogging a long technical start-up phase for implementing stand-alone embodied carbon policy.

AB  - Abstract copyright UK Data Service and data collection copyright owner.The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) that collects information about people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of housing in England. The EHS brings together two previous survey series into a single fieldwork operation: the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33158) and the Survey of English Housing (SEH) (available under GN 33277). The EHS covers all housing tenures and provides valuable information and evidence to inform the development and monitoring of the department's housing policies. Results from the survey are also used by a wide range of other users including other government departments, local authorities, housing associations, landlords, academics, construction industry professionals, consultants, and the general public. The EHS has a complex multi-stage methodology consisting of two main elements; an initial interview survey of around 14,000 households and a follow-up physical inspection. Some further elements are also periodically included in or derived from the EHS: for 2008 and 2009, a desk-based market valuation was conducted of a sub-sample of 8,000 dwellings (including vacant ones), but this was not carried out from 2010 onwards. A periodic follow-up survey of private landlords and agents (the Private Landlords Survey (PLS)) is conducted using information from the EHS interview survey. Fuel Poverty datasets are also available from 2003, created by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC). The EHS interview survey sample formed part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) (available from the Archive under GN 33420) from April 2008 to April 2011. During this period the core questions from the IHS formed part of the EHS questionnaire. End User Licence and Special Licence Versions: From 2014 data onwards, the End User Licence (EUL) versions of the EHS only include derived variables. In addition the number of variables on the EUL datasets from that date has been reduced and disclosure control increased on certain remaining variables. The new Special Licence versions of the EHS, which are subject to more restrictive access conditions, are of a similar nature to EHS EUL datasets prior to 2014 and include both derived and raw datasets. Further information about the EHS and the latest news, reports and tables can be found on the GOV.UK English Housing Survey web pages. The English Housing Survey, 2015-2016: Household Data: Special Licence Access comprises both the raw and derived interview data for all cases where an interview has been completed (as opposed to the EUL version held under SN 8185, which includes only derived data). Datasets are provided for single financial years together with annual weights. The survey consists of a detailed interview using a CAPI based program. An interview is first conducted with the householder. General topics and concepts covered include household characteristics, satisfaction with the home and the area, disability and adaptations to the home, ownership and rental details and income details. Users are advised to obtain SN 8185 to see whether it is suitable for their needs before making an application for the Special Licence version. The household data should be used for any analysis where only information from the household interview is required. Users who also require data from the physical survey should use the English Housing Survey, 2015: Housing Stock Data EUL or Special Licence versions (SNs 8186 and 8255 respectively).

TI  - Energy cost optimization through load shifting in a photovoltaic energy-sharing household community
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Home energy management systems are essential for the optimization of resources in complex demand scheduling problems that require energy efficiency in homes. This can be achieved through the use of Renewable Electricity Sources (RES), for cleaner and more sustainable energy generation, as well as participation in Demand Response (DR) programs, for lower energy prices. The problem becomes more complex when it is considered a community of households. This paper aims to address individual and community household participation in DR programs and RES sharing while considering constraints imposed on the operation schedule of appliances, through load shifting optimization. For that, a Genetic Algorithm is proposed, implemented, and validated, which focuses on minimizing energy costs. It takes into account dynamic pricing, distributed generation, and household community energy sharing. Using real household workload data, two case studies are presented, one for the cost optimization of an individual household and another for a photovoltaic energy-sharing household community containing twenty houses. Both case studies represent five days of scheduling, where each house can have up to five appliances able to shift. The business as usual costs are 16.74 EUR and 269.99 EUR for the individual and community case studies, respectively. Results show improvements of up to 24.3% (12.67 EUR in the optimized schedule, 4.07 EUR in savings) for the individual case study and 11.8% (238.21 EUR in the optimized schedule, 31.78 EUR in savings) for the household community. In a community, households can expect cost reductions of 1.5%-26.8% when compared to individual scheduling.

TI  - Climate risks, energy efficiency and mortgage lending
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - The aim of the project is to advance our understanding of the financial risk posed by the physical changes from Climate Change, i.e. changing weather and temperatures, and of green policies accompanying the transition to net zero. The project focuses on risks in the housing and mortgage markets in the UK. The project aims to deliver high-quality research output that quantifies these climate-related risks in mortgage lending. Using unique microdata, we will investigate how i) changing heating and cooling demands, ii) energy costs, and iii) efficiency standard setting affect house prices and mortgage default rates. The empirical results will be used to simulate the impact of currently proposed green policies and climate-related weather events on aggregated risk in the mortgage market and to the BoE's balance sheet. The ensuing financial risks in the mortgage market, and how to manage and mitigate them, have received little attention so far.

TI  - Simulating Energy Use, Indoor Temperatures, and Utility Cost Impacts Amidst a Warming Climate in a Multi-family Housing Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN HEALTH-BULLETIN OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising ambient temperatures due to climate change will impact both indoor temperatures and heating and cooling utility costs. In traditionally colder climates, there are potential tradeoffs in how to meet the reduced heating and increased cooling demands, and issues related to lack of air conditioning (AC) access in older homes and among lower-income populations to prevent extreme heat exposure. We modeled a typical multi-family home in Boston (MA) in the building simulation program EnergyPlus to assess indoor temperature and energy consumption in current (2020) and projected future (2050) weather conditions. Selected households were those without AC (no AC), those who ran AC sometimes (some AC), and those with sufficient resources to run AC always (full AC). We considered stylized cooling subsidy policies that allowed households to move between groups, both independently and in conjunction with energy efficiency retrofits. Results showed that future weather conditions without policy changes yielded an increase in indoor summer temperatures of 2.1 degrees C (no AC), increased cooling demand (range: 34-50%), but led to a decrease in net yearly total utility costs per apartment (range: - $21 to - $38). Policies that allowed households to move to greater AC utilization yielded average indoor summer temperature decreases (- 3.5 degrees C to - 6.2 degrees C) and net yearly total utility increases (range: + $2 to + $94) per apartment unit, with greater savings for retrofitted homes primarily due to large decreases in heating use. Our model results reinforce the importance of coordinated public policies addressing climate change that have an equity lens for both health and climate goals.

TI  - Sensing-based park cooling performance observation and assessment: A review
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Parks are important solutions to urban heat challenges given their potential for cool island effects. Observation and assessment of park cooling performance are important for providing urban planners, designers, and managers with fundamental information for accurate decisions relevant to park planning, design, construction, and maintenance. This paper presents a review of sensing-based park cooling performance studies, aiming to i) understand the research evolution of sensing-based park cooling studies, ii) reveal the emergence and advancement of sensing techniques, iii) analyze park cooling assessment methods and indicators, iv) document the spatiotemporal variations of park cooling performance, v) explore key factors affecting cooling performance, and vi) discuss the research gaps and practical shortcomings, and propose suggestions for addressing them. The results indicate that sensing techniques enhance researchers' capacity to observe park cooling performance, as evidenced by the rapid increase in publications, research areas, source journals, and leading nations. Sensingbased park cooling studies were shaped as sensing-based techniques for understanding environmental sciences relevant to ecology and forestry, thereby improving the technology implementation capacity for better urban construction and management. The cooling performance can be assessed by the cooling distance, cooling intensity, cooling strength, cooling area, cooling efficiency, and cooling gradient. These indicators were further linked to cooling service accessibility, building energy efficiency, house prices, and social equality. However, the terminology and definitions of such indicators in many studies were mixed, and the assessment methods were not unified, reducing the comparability, robustness, and reliability of the results. However, existing studies have widely demonstrated spatial homogeneity, spatial heterogeneity, and temporal trends in park cooling performance, with some studies presenting contradictory results. Moreover, park cooling performance could be affected by many factors in geographic, climatic, urban development, weather, sampling, methodological, geometric, spatial, and vegetational aspects. To avoid ignoring some explainable variables, we suggest that it is important to describe influential factors, assessment methods, and assessment indicators for accurate, reliable, and comparable cooling performance. Overall, this study provides a reference for comprehensively understanding sensing-based park cooling performance observation and assessment, and it enlightens researchers to understand the methodological significance of park cooling performance assessments.

TI  - The price of natural gas dependency: Price shocks, inequality, and public policy
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2022 natural gas price spikes across Europe raised concerns regarding their distributionai cof iota e zuence... This paper investigates the distributional effect of price increases between and, in particular, within different income groups in Germany, accounting for different detenninants of gas erpenditures. The study 5nds that lowincome households are affected the most by the gas price increase. Low-income households pay, at the median, 11.70 percent of their equivalent income for natural gas, while high-income households pay, at the median, 2.41 percent. Moreo%er, natural gas expenditures are higher for tenants in detached houses and in houses without double glazing or thermal insulation. Dur policy analysis shows that a well-targeted subsidy scheme can be more effective at reducing inequality and less costly than a subsidy for all households. Additionally, the introduction of a minimum energy efficiency standard for buildings can help reduce inequality in the medium term.

TI  - How policy instruments reproduce energy vulnerability-A qualitative study of Dutch household energy efficiency measures
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising energy prices threaten households' access to affordable energy services and increase the risk of energy vulnerability. One way to reduce the cost of access to energy is to implement energy efficiency measures at the household level (e.g. solar panels). However, not all households have the capacity to do this. Households that are unable to implement energy efficiency measures are vulnerable in two ways: 1) they may not enjoy the benefits of these measures (such as lower energy costs, healthier and more comfortable living conditions), and 2) they may face increasing costs due to fluctuating market prices for non-renewable energy sources or taxes on nonrenewable energy sources. Although public authorities use different policy instruments to support citizens in implementing energy efficiency measures, it turns out that these policy instruments can (re)produce energy vulnerability in an uneven way. However, how exactly this happens remains unclear. The aim of this paper is to use the capability approach to identify mechanisms that explain how policy instruments (re)produce energy vulnerability. By combining three qualitative methods to analyse two Dutch neighbourhoods, this article illustrates how institutional arrangements affect capabilities unequally, depending on spatial scale, language skills, socio-economic characteristics and housing situation. Finally, it presents three subsequent mechanisms through which policy instruments may negatively affect citizens' capabilities and increase the risk of energy vulnerability: 1) by precluding citizens from relevant information about the energy transition; 2) by raising the thresholds for citizens to implement energy-efficient measures; and 3) by miscalculating policy consequences, i.e. citizens' poor anticipation of long-term policy implications, aggravated by legal and financial uncertainty or changing individual circumstances.

TI  - Cash for Coolers or Sustainable Lighting? Assessing Different Components of a Large-Scale Energy Efficiency Program in Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In one of the largest demand-side energy efficiency programs at the time, the Mexican government supported more than 11 million, mostly low-income households in replacing their old light bulbs and appliances with more efficient models. Previous evaluations of this program focused exclusively on appliances, which made up almost 90 per cent of the total program cost, and found modest benefits in terms of energy savings. This study compares the respective effects of replacing light bulbs and appliances simultaneously in a single econometric framework, using data from nationally representative household surveys and a difference-in-differences approach which exploits geographical variation in treatment intensities. Despite using different sources and types of data, our results for the appliances replacement intervention are largely in line with the estimates of previous studies. In addition, we find that the impact on energy consumption (proxied by the amount paid for electricity) of replacing light bulbs was of comparable magnitude as that of replacing appliances, although the average cost per participating household was much smaller. Overall, our results suggest that low-cost investments that help poor households reduce their energy consumption for lighting can have high returns on energy efficiency in the residential sector.

TI  - Defining sustainable home renovators in Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Home renovation is a global phenomenon, where households seek to remodel, reconfigure, and retrofit their home. While often a response to the material conditions of a dwelling, such as decay and damage, renovation also as emerges as a practice central to identity creation, sense of home, and leisure. Importantly, improving household sustainability is increasingly driving renovation activities, as governments and households seek to reduce the environmental impact of residential dwellings. Drawing on data collected from a national survey developed by the authors, this paper explores sustainable renovation practices in Australia. The paper provides a three-level analysis of home renovators. First, the paper profiles recent renovators. Second, the extent to which sustainability was considered by recent renovators during the renovation process is investigated. Third, the relationship between personal values placed on household sustainability and the sustainable renovation practices are explored. The analysis reveals that sustainability is an important renovation driver. However, sustainable renovation practices differ between groups of homeowners, with educated and wealthy homeowners most likely to undertake sustainable renovation. Further, those with a stronger commitment to household sustainability are the most likely to include expensive sustainability technologies as part of their renovations. However, it is younger households, who are less committed to the principles of household sustainability, that are most likely to access government subsidies to support the inclusion of these technologies as part of their renovation. The different profiles and actions of these renovator groups reveal a series of challenges and opportunities for governments seeking to promote household sustainability.

TI  - Opportunities for a low-emission transformation of Colombia's food system.
T2  - CIFOR Infobrief
M3  - Bulletin
AB  - The food system in Colombia contributes a significant proportion (62%) of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which is twice the global average (31%). The three primary sources of emissions in Colombia's food system, ranked in decreasing order of importance, are: (i) net forest conversion, accounting for 45% of total food system emissions; (ii) livestock management, including enteric fermentation and manure management (35% of emissions); and (iii) food system waste disposal (6% of emissions). Mitigation strategies in Colombia's food system should prioritize reducing emissions from these sources, and continue and expand actions to increase forest-related carbon sinks. Beyond-farmgate emissions, which represent a significant (13%) and growing share of total food system emissions, can be effectively reduced through improved energy efficiency and minimized food waste across food value chains, minimizing food waste in consumer households, and enhancing value chain integration, such as biomass management. Effective climate action planning should not only consider the size of sectoral emissions but also consider the cost and feasibility (referred to as the 'political economy') of implementing transformative measures. More data collection is needed to support this approach. A comprehensive and integrated approach to reducing GHG emissions, encompassing the entire food supply chain from production to disposal, can be integrated across sectors to ensure the efficient and effective implementation of Colombia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).

AB  - Abstract copyright UK Data Service and data collection copyright owner.TheEnglish Housing Survey(EHS ) Fuel Poverty Datasets are comprised of fuel poverty variables derived from the EHS, and a number of EHS variables commonly used in fuel poverty reporting. TheEHS is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Ministry of Housing, Community and Local Government (MHCLG) that collects information about people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of housing in England.End User Licence and Special Licence VersionsSimilar to the main EHS, two versions of the Fuel Poverty dataset are available from 2014 onwards. The Special Licence version contains additional, more detailed, variables, and is therefore subject to more restrictive access conditions. Users should check the End User Licence version first to see whether it meeds their needs, before making an application for the Special Licence version. Fuel Poverty DatasetThe fuel poverty dataset is comprised of fuel poverty variables derived from the English Housing Survey (EHS), and a number of EHS variables commonly used in fuel poverty reporting. The fieldwork for the EHS is carried out each financial year (between April and March). The fuel poverty datasets combine data from two consecutive financial years. Full information on the EHS survey is available at the MHCLG EHS website and further information on Fuel Poverty and the EHS can be sought from FuelPoverty@beis.gov.uk and ehs@communities.gov.uk respectively. Guidance on use of EHS data provided by MHCLG should also be applied to the fuel poverty dataset. Main Topics: The data cover modelled household fuel costs and consumption.

AB  - This research centres on developing a Home Electricity Management (HEM) system, a pivotal component within the modern supply chain for home electrical power. The system optimizes the scheduling of intelligent home gadgets through advanced meta-heuristics, specifically the Social Spider Algorithm (SSA) and Strawberry Algorithm (SWA), to efficiently manage home energy consumption. Within the supply chain context, HEM acts as a crucial link in the distribution and utilization of electricity within households, akin to optimizing resource allocation and demand balancing within a supply chain for efficient operation and cost-effectiveness. Simulations and comparisons demonstrate that SWA excels in cost savings, while SSA is more effective in reducing peak-to-average power ratios. The proposed solution reduces costs for residences by up to 3.5 percent, highlighting the potential for significant cost savings and efficiency improvements within the home electricity supply chain. It also surpasses existing cost and Peak Average (PAR) ratio meta-heuristics, indicating superior performance within the overall energy supply and consumption framework. Moreover, implementing the HEM system contributes to reducing carbon emissions, aligning with sustainability goals in the energy supply chain. It promotes energy efficiency, integrates renewable sources, and facilitates demand response, mirroring the emphasis on sustainability in supply chain practices.

TI  - P-Renewal Project: A Reflexive Contribution to the Evolution of Energy Performance Standards for the Renovation of Historic Buildings
T2  - HERITAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - To meet European carbon neutrality targets and comply with building energy performance regulations, renovating historic buildings is considered one of the most challenging tasks for the construction sector. On one hand, commonly employed renovation solutions are often more difficult to implement on these structures. On the other hand, renovation work must be carried out while preserving their heritage value and integrity. The European standard EN 16883 on conservation and energy renovation performance of cultural heritage was developed in 2017 with the aim of facilitating energy performance improvements in historic buildings while respecting their cultural significance. In pursuit of the same objective, the "P-Renewal" project focuses on the energy retrofit of pre-war Walloon housing with heritage value, providing valuable support through a reflective process and decision-making tools. These tools enable the selection of renovation strategies that effectively combine the preservation of heritage value with improvements in internal comfort, energy efficiency, and environmental performance. This study compares the reflective process of the research project with the guidelines of the standard EN 16883 and discusses the transferability of this contribution to other European contexts. This will significantly contribute to the evolution of energy performance standards for the renovation of historic buildings.

TI  - Heterogeneous impacts of building codes on residential energy demand
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assess the tangible effects of building energy efficiency standards, a prevalent residential energy efficiency policy globally. Employing comprehensive household-level data (N=84,864) from Turkey, we analyze the heterogeneous impacts of building codes on the energy consumption of houses equipped with diverse heating technologies. Our findings reveal that, on average, building codes result in an approximate six percent reduction in heating energy demand for houses constructed after the regulation. Notably, this effect is statistically significant solely for homes featuring collective central heating systems within multifamily buildings. Conversely, the policy has no significant impact on energy demand for houses using stoves, individual boilers, or electricity-based heating systems. We suggest that the aforementioned outcome may be partially attributed to potential "rebound"and "pre-bound"effects stemming from the decreased heating costs in newer dwellings. Moreover, the observed influence on dwellings equipped with collective central heating systems can be attributed to the compulsory installation of individual meters in newer constructions. This incentivizes households to limit their energy consumption when compared to older properties where heating costs are distributed evenly among residents. These findings underscore the importance of behavioral interventions in shaping effective energy-saving policies. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effectiveness of residential energy efficiency policies may vary across countries, contingent on the distribution of heating systems in the building sector and a country's economic development level.

AB  - This research centres on developing a Home Electricity Management (HEM) system, a pivotal component within the modern supply chain for home electrical power. The system optimizes the scheduling of intelligent home gadgets through advanced meta-heuristics, specifically the Social Spider Algorithm (SSA) and Strawberry Algorithm (SWA), to efficiently manage home energy consumption. Within the supply chain context, HEM acts as a crucial link in the distribution and utilization of electricity within households, akin to optimizing resource allocation and demand balancing within a supply chain for efficient operation and cost-effectiveness. Simulations and comparisons demonstrate that SWA excels in cost savings, while SSA is more effective in reducing peak-to-average power ratios. The proposed solution reduces costs for residences by up to 3.5 percent, highlighting the potential for significant cost savings and efficiency improvements within the home electricity supply chain. It also surpasses existing cost and Peak Average (PAR) ratio meta-heuristics, indicating superior performance within the overall energy supply and consumption framework. Moreover, implementing the HEM system contributes to reducing carbon emissions, aligning with sustainability goals in the energy supply chain. It promotes energy efficiency, integrates renewable sources, and facilitates demand response, mirroring the emphasis on sustainability in supply chain practices. Overall, this research offers a practical and sustainable approach to home energy management, bringing substantial cost savings and environmental benefits to the modern supply chain for residential electricity.

TI  - Decarbonisation Policies in the Residential Sector and Energy Poverty: Mitigation Strategies and Impacts in Central and Southern Eastern Europe
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The decarbonisation policies for the EU building stock can improve living conditions, including thermal comfort and lower energy bills. However, these measures may impose financial burdens on low-income households, reducing their disposable income and exacerbating their vulnerability. The current study investigates the impact of decarbonisation policies on the EU's building stock, with a specific focus on Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), the new Emissions Trading System (ETS2) for buildings, and the phase-out of fossil heating systems. By employing a linear, static latest version of Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365)-based model and analyzing Eurostat data, this study quantifies the effects of these policies on energy consumption, costs, and necessary investments. Moreover, the study emphasizes their implications for low-income groups using vulnerability indicators. The findings demonstrate that a combination of MEPs, ETS2, and phasing out fossil heating systems effectively reduces energy consumption and costs across most countries. However, implementing ETS2 alone may lead to energy reduction and discomfort for low-income groups without addressing underlying demand-side issues. To address this, this study recommends the implementation of more ambitious MEPs or the provision of additional funding alongside ETS2. The phase-out of fossil fuel boilers emerges as the most cost-effective measure in the medium to long term. While MEPS and the phase-out of fossil fuel boilers improve living conditions, they also impose upfront cost burdens and reduce disposable income for low-income households. Therefore, high subsidy rates and supportive policies are necessary to ensure equitable access to investments. The main recommendations include (a) shifting financing to renewable heating systems for low-income households by 2025, addressing cost issues and policies favouring gas boilers; (b) implementing high-funding rate subsidies for energy efficiency in low-income households before 2025, with technical guidance; (c) prioritising the Energy Efficiency First principle in planning to avoid additional emissions or higher costs for low-income households; and (d) considering the energy behaviour of low-income groups in regulations, employing a combination of policies to achieve desired outcomes and ensure thermal comfort.

TI  - Costs and Benefits of Household Fuel Policies and Alternative Strategies in the Jing-Jin-Ji Region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is still one of the most severe problems in northern China, especially in the Jing-Jin-Ji region around Beijing. In recent years, China has implemented many stringent policies to address the air quality issue, including promoting energy transition toward cleaner fuels in residential sectors. But until 2020, even in the Jing-Jin-Ji region, nearly half of the rural households still use solid fuels for heating. For residents who are not covered by the clean heating campaign, we analyze five potential mitigation strategies and evaluate their environmental effects as well as the associated health benefits and costs. We estimate that substitution with electricity or gas would reduce air pollution and premature mortality more strongly, while the relatively low investment costs of implementing clean coal or biomass pellet lead to a larger benefit-cost ratio, indicating higher cost efficiency. Hence, clean coal or biomass pellet could be transitional substitution options for the less developed or remote areas which cannot afford a total transition toward electricity or natural gas in the short term.

TI  - Improving the Energy Performance and Economic Benefits of Aged Residential Buildings by Retrofitting in Hot-Humid Regions of China
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing building stock faces the challenge of low energy efficiency and requires renovation and upgrading to meet society & PRIME;s goals of carbon reduction and sustainable development. This study presents an optimization framework utilizing genetic algorithms to develop robust retrofit plans that balance the need for improved energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness considerations for householders, and uncertainties regarding climate conditions. A case study of an aged residential building in a hot and humid region of China is used to demonstrate the proposed method. The optimization results show a potential energy demand reduction of 81.5%. However, due to the relatively long time required to realize economic benefits from high investments, short-term optimization tends to favor solutions with high energy demand and low primary costs. To effectively reduce carbon emissions, it is recommended to consider the long-term economic benefits of retrofits and prioritize solutions with high energy efficiency. However, it is important to acknowledge that the expensive nature of retrofit investments may pose barriers to residents. Society should provide adequate support and guidance to facilitate residential renovation efforts.

TI  - An efficient and economic evacuated U-tube solar collector powered air gap membrane distillation hybrid system for seawater desalination
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-powered membrane distillation is a promising desalination technology that can provide accessible and reliable freshwater for coastal and island households. However, high installment cost and low efficiency are two main hindering factors restricting the widespread application of this technology. To solve these issues, a low-cost air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) desalination system powered by efficient evacuated U-tube solar collector (EUSC) is put forward to theoretically predict its effectiveness. A system-scale mathematical model for the proposed hybrid system is established and validated. The system performance is predicted under the weather conditions of southeast China (Ningbo city). The maximum permeate flux, energy efficiency and exergy effi-ciency are, respectively, 3.16 kg m- 2 h-1, 56.71% and 0.38%, showing a bright application prospect. Numerous parametric studies are undertaken to explore how to further enhance the performance of this technique. The long-term running performance for the year of 2021 and last 41 years is also revealed. The yearly average production is about 6452 kg, which can satisfy the drinking water demand for a household of 6 members. Furthermore, economic study is presented and the levelized cost of water is only 8.54 $/m3. The proposed EUSC/ AGMD coupling system is an efficient and economic alternative for small-scale solar seawater desalination.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of energy efficiency strategies on households' energy affordability: A Spanish case study
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The low energy efficiency of the European building stock is both a social and environmental issue. However, plans and studies on energy retrofitting interventions do not usually evaluate the impact of these measures on households' energy affordability. This paper analyses and compares the effect of alternative retrofitting strategies on thermal energy services' affordability in Spanish vulnerable households. This analysis was carried out by applying the Required Thermal Energy Expenditure model proposed in previous studies to several 2030 residential building stock scenarios, setting 2020 as a baseline. Therefore, this work proposes a methodological approach to assess the impact of the considered energy efficiency interventions on energy poverty in winter (WEP) and summer (SEP) and carries out both a 'social cost' and a cost-benefit analysis. The dwelling's thermal-enclosure retrofitting stands out as a very WEP-reduction and social-cost effective measure. Instead, replacing old thermal systems with more efficient ones would have a higher impact on SEP. Combining both kinds of retrofitting measures could reduce heating and cooling required expenditures by, respectively, 49% and 59%, and decrease the WEP and SEP share, correspondingly, by 35% and 63%. These results might inform policymakers to enhance the targeting and design of energy efficiency programs.

TI  - Policy pressure to retrofit Germany's residential buildings to higher energy efficiency standards: A cost-effective way to reduce CO2 emissions?
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Germany's climate goals require over 75% of its housing stock to be retrofitted for energy efficiency. An important question for Germany and other countries is, what minimum energy efficiency standard should be mandated for housing retrofits so as to reduce CO2 emissions economically efficiently? It has long been known that the marginal costs of energy efficiency increase as standards are pushed higher, and therefore the marginal costs of CO2 abatement increase, but at the same time energy consumption reduces, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. This paper investigates where the social optimum lies between these two effects. In addition to a large database of house sale advertisements containing price and energy efficiency data, it uses two semi-official data sources of modelled and actual energy efficiency upgrades in Germany. It finds that retrofitting to a modestly high standard of about 70 kWh/m2/y entails marginal costs of CO2 abatement comparable to current CO2 prices. However, each step to a higher standard increases these by up to an order of magnitude, with absurdly high marginal costs of CO2 abatement for the highest standards. German policymakers are currently pushing for higher minimum standards, but money could better be spent retrofitting more houses to less stringent standards.

T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the fact that the European Union is striving to achieve its sustainable development goals, in particular goal No. 7, which is to provide users with low-emission, and cheap access to, energy, this article's aim is to verify whether there is a relationship between R&D expenditure and key energy variables in the EU countries in 2010-2020. Data on R&D expenditures incurred by the EU Member States in the period 2010-2020 were used for the research and were tested using the Autoregressive Distributed Lags Model (ARDL). The study identified a strong positive relationship between total R&D expenditure and the increase in energy consumption from renewable energy sources, and a smaller impact of total R&D expenditure as well as enterprise R&D expenditure on the increase in fossil energy consumption. Also noted was a weak relationship between R&D expenditure and electricity and gas prices for both household and non-household customers. The obtained results prove that in the context of the level of implementation of SDG No. 7 in the EU countries, R&D expenditure results in greater access to low-emission energy from renewable sources, but the achievement of the aforementioned sustainable development goal in other aspects (reduction in energy consumption from fossil fuels and ensuring lower price energy) is not possible with the current level of R&D expenditure.

TI  - Efficient Demand Side Management Using a Novel Decentralized Building Automation Algorithm
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Given its adaptable and efficient energy consuming devices during peak hours, the residential building sector is urged to take part in demand response (DR) initiatives with the use of a building energy management system (BMS). The residents of buildings with BMS enjoy secure, pleasant, and fully managed lifestyles. Although the BMS helps the building consume less energy and encourages occupant engagement in energy-saving initiatives, unwelcome interruptions and harsh instructions from the system are inconvenient for the inhabitants, which further discourages their participation in DR initiatives. Building automation control is a crucial factor for improving buildings' energy efficiency and management, as well as improving the electricity grid's reliability indices. Smart houses that use the right sizing procedure and energy-management techniques can help lower the demand on the entire grid and potentially sell clean energy to the utility. Recently, smart houses have been presented as an alternative to traditional power-system issues including thermal plant emissions and the risk of blackouts brought on by malfunctioning bulk plants or transmission lines. This paper describes the necessary technology requirements and presents the methodology and the decentralized building automation novel algorithm for efficient demand side management in a building management system. Human comfort aspects including thermal comfort and visual comfort were taken into consideration when selecting heating and lighting controls. The suggested BMS relies primarily on a load-shifting technique, which moves controllable loads to low-cost periods to avoid high loading during peak hours. The model aims to minimize the individual household electricity consumption cost while considering customers' comfort and lifestyle. All these are applied in an experimental university microgrid, and the results are presented in terms of energy saving in kWh, money in euro, and working hours. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach might successfully lower energy use during the DR period and enhance occupant comfort.

TI  - Assessment of energy and thermal resilience performance to inform climate mitigation of multifamily buildings in disadvantaged communities
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The compound impacts of heatwaves and power outages pose a serious indoor heat -related health risk for residents living in disadvantaged communities (DACs) with limited or no air conditioning. In this study we selected 13 heat vulnerable multifamily buildings in El Monte, in Los Angeles County, and employed CityBES to evaluate their energy and thermal resilience performance. A retrofit package with seven passive and low -power active measures-cool roof, cool wall, window solar film, air sealing, internal blinds, natural ventilation, and ceiling fan-was evaluated under 2018 weather conditions and projected 2058 future weather conditions. Results show: (1) under the 2018 weather conditions, the retrofit package reduces the peak electricity load by 19 % and reduces the annual energy cost by $183 per housing unit; (2) the housing units without air conditioning would face heat danger conditions throughout the heatwave period. Although the retrofit package could reduce the heat danger hours by 50 % in 2018 and 34 % in 2058, air conditioning is a life -essential need for residents during heatwaves. These results indicate that, during the decision making of energy and climate retrofits for housing in DACs, policymakers and building owners should consider the co -benefits of reducing indoor heat -related mortality while reducing energy cost.

TI  - On the Minimum and Maximum Variable Cost of Heating of the Flat in Multifamily Building
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat cost allocation is commonly used in existing buildings supplied by centralized sources of heating/cooling and provided with individual metering systems. However, this process is not always fair for the users, since "fairness" strongly depends on the methods established to allocate variable and fixed costs among the dwellings. That is why unrealistic cost for heating may be allocated for specific flats. However, there is a lack of evidence about procedures as to how maximum and minimum variable cost of heating may be calculated for specific flats in multifamily building for a specific heating season. This paper presents different methods for estimation of maximum and minimum variable cost of heating of flat in multifamily buildings, the use of which depends of the availability of input data for specific buildings. Evaluation of the proposed methods is made on the example of a case study multifamily building located in Poland. It was shown that the maximum variable costs of heat purchase for specific flats in the analyzed building were in the range from 169% to 256% of the average unit cost of heat, depending on the method used. The recommendation about the accuracy of proposed methods is also provided by the authors.

TI  - A Prototype of Low-Cost Home Automation System for Energy Savings and Living Comfort
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to put into practice the objectives proposed by the policy of energy transition towards systems and buildings increasingly electrified, smart and sustainable, the massive digitization of environments and systems in both residential and commercial plays a key role, in view of the 'internet of things.' This paper aims to demonstrate the possibility of creating a reliable and robust building automation and monitoring system, maintaining, at the same time, a character of cost-effectiveness essential for a massive spread of these technologies. A case study has been realized by taking as reference a typical home in which smart devices have been placed, aimed at equipment controlling and widespread energy consumption monitoring, both electrical and thermal. The main environmental parameters influencing energy processes are also monitored, such as: position of the windows (open/closed), temperature and humidity of the individual areas air, levels of illuminance and the presence of people in the rooms and in the entire building. These elements were then integrated into the open-source SCADA (or better personal hub) "Home Assistant" and made available on a very simple dashboard, locally accessible through any web browser. As we will see, the complete low-cost smartization of the house brings a considerable advantage on energy savings, as well as an obvious greater comfort for users.

TI  - Solar-assisted poultry production in small-scale farms: a case study in the Bekaa semi-arid region, Lebanon
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn Lebanon, poultry production is one of the major components of the agricultural sector; however, it suffers from increasing energy costs necessary to cover poultry heating requirements. This affects the profits of brooding farms, namely, small-scale farms in rural areas. Few studies have addressed the use of renewable energy in the poultry industry in Lebanon, with most having focused on modelling ventilation and air quality requirements in poultry houses. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the efficiency of renewable energy sources in providing heating requirements for poultry production. Accordingly, this study evaluates the performance of a solar-assisted, localized heating system in providing heat requirements for chicks in a renovated green poultry house in the Bekaa semi-arid rural region in Lebanon. For this aim, two brooding cycles were conducted during the warm and cold seasons in a greenhouse and were later replicated in a conventional poultry house.ResultsThe energy inputs in the green and conventional houses, respectively, were 33,995.39 and 40,656.97 MJ (1000 birds)-1 in the warm season, and 37,058.25 and 45,770.05 MJ (1000 birds)-1 in the cold season. Calculated energy efficiency values for the green and conventional poultry houses were, respectively, 0.58 and 0.50 in the warm season, and 0.46 and 0.41 in the cold season. The net return was negative for both systems and the benefit-to-cost ratio from broiler production was calculated to be 0.49 and 0.50 in the green and conventional houses, respectively. Life cycle cost analysis showed that adopting the green heating system in the studied farm would entail an 18.89% increase in cost over a period of 20 years as compared to the conventional system.ConclusionIt was concluded that poultry production is not profitable in small-scale farms in the studied area in Lebanon. The use of renewable energy might be more suited for large-scale broiler operations to achieve their purpose in reducing overall production costs. Optimization of the green system to fully satisfy the poultry energy requirements would render it more economically competitive.

TI  - Labor camps in Dubai: implications of courtyard regulations on daylight performance
T2  - OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose The fundamental aim of the study is to investigate the implications of labor housing designs in Dubai, with a focus on courtyards and the governing building regulations, on daylight performance as an underlying factor impacting laborers' indoor environmental quality. Several studies shed light on the subject of labor camps and labor migration in Dubai, but few have focused on the subject from the perspective of the environmental performance of these camps. A model that represents one of the labor camps was built using Rhinoceros 7.0 and Grasshopper software packages. Annual daylighting and glare simulations were carried out using the lighting modeling engine RADIANCE 5.0 in conjunction with the "ClimateStudio". Design/methodology/approach The construction sector has emerged as a significant economic development driver, attracting a diverse labor force from a variety of countries to Dubai. As a result, Dubai authorities have implemented several measures to ensure the provision of suitable housing facilities for its labor force. These measures contribute to the reduction of energy costs in labor housing by encouraging the use of renewable energy. While several studies shed light on the subject of labor camps and labor migration in Dubai, few have focused on the subject from the perspective of the environmental performance of these camps. Findings The study provided statistical evidence that the current regulations governing courtyards in labor housing resulted in significant changes in daylight levels across different floor levels of the labor housing units. It is suggested that both 2:3 and 3:4 Court Width-to-Height ratios would further contribute to a more consistent daylight Illuminance with marginal statistical differences between floor levels (p > 0.05). The 3:4 ratio, on the other hand, offers a consistent distribution across all floor levels in the North and South with negligible variances, although weakly significant differences can be yet expected between the first and fourth floors in the East and West orientations (p < 0.05). The results of Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) suggest excessive solar incidence and a high probability of glare, which remains a problem that must be addressed under the governing building regulations. Originality/value This study could serve as a framework for analyzing and contrasting the findings of other studies on labor accommodation, notably in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Such an approach has the potential to enhance living conditions in labor accommodations in Dubai and other areas. It is necessary to meet people' physical and psychological well-being while also addressing sustainability and regulatory compliance.

TI  - Innovation in Housing: Health and prevention in Cwm Taf Morgannwg
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Housing is a key factor in people's health. Poorly maintained, overcrowded, cold, damp or insecure homes are key generators of poor physical and mental health, as well as driving wider differences in the population. Poor housing costs the NHS in Wales in the region of &pound;100m per year with people with chronic conditions becoming sicker, visiting the GP or hospital more often and is linked with both increased healthcare need and reduced access to care.  Good quality housing is essential for health and well-being. Every &pound;1 spent on home adaptations can generate &pound;7.50 of health and social care cost savings, whilst reducing wider social and health differences that we often see.  This project will identify the homes that can most benefit through the linkage of housing and health data. We will use the details from Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) that are created every time a property is sold or rented. These contain useful information which tells us a lot about the energy efficiency of a house and also what can be done to improve this.  There is a scheme called ECO4 which is a UK-wide &pound;1billion fund created from the profits of energy companies. ECO4 provides grants to fund energy efficient upgrades to homes reducing emissions, electricity and energy bills. Grants pay for new heating systems like boilers, loft or installation designed primarily to increase energy efficiency, reduce fuel poverty and energy costs and improvement health benefits. Part of this scheme called LA Flex allows local authorities to also propose properties to receive the grants for improvement where the people living there have a chronic health condition.  This project has three key objectives; Identify the target population and individuals who will benefit from ECO4; Develop the plan how to deliver the operation; and Exploring of how we will deliver this in statutory way with multiple stakeholders.  As a group we have already completed a successful project where we looked at the differences in Covid rates and hospital attendance for people living in Social Housing opened by Hafod Housing. We will work with Hafod again to deliver this project looking at how we can improve their housing stock but many of the approaches we aim to develop will be useful for many homes both in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and beyond.

TI  - A Multi-Objective Optimization Method for the Design of a Sustainable House in Ecuador by Assessing LCC and LCEI
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The building industry significantly contributes to global warming, driving the demand for sustainable construction and green buildings. However, barriers like cost concerns and limited knowledge persist. Previous studies have used multi-objective optimization (MOO) to minimize life cycle cost and environmental impact, often emphasizing energy efficiency. In equatorial climates, unique factors like material selection must be considered. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of sustainable materials, focusing on envelope materials in Ecuador. The case study is a single-family house in the equatorial climate, optimized using Building Information Modeling (BIM), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). In this study, a MOO process using the weighted sum approach (WSA) identifies sustainable house designs. The sustainable houses achieve a 98% decrease in Ozone Depletion Potential, a 75% reduction in Global Warming Potential, and a 45% drop in Primary Energy Demand, although they still incur a 30% increased cost. The results offer a foundation for cost-effective, eco-friendly housing solutions. Bamboo emerges as a promising material with local acceptance. This research highlights the significance of material selection in sustainable construction and provides a replicable approach for diverse settings. It aims to promote sustainable housing solutions in Ecuador and beyond.

TI  - Unraveling the Knowledge Roadmap of Building Policy Mixes: A Scientometric Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions from buildings are crucial for achieving sustainable development. To realize these goals, it is essential to adopt a policy mix. However, despite much effort in this field, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding on building policy mixes (BPMs), which challenges building sustainability. To address this research gap, this study attempted to uncover the knowledge landscape of BPM through scientometric analysis. By employing methods such as keywords co-occurrence analysis, clustering analysis, co-citation analysis, and research trend analysis, this study systematically examined the current status, hot topics, underlying knowledge framework, knowledge domains, and frontiers of BPM research. The findings revealed that the existing BPM research primarily focuses on various aspects, including policy-related topics such as building energy efficiency policies and policy instruments, as well as topics like green affordable housing, hindering factors, carbon pricing, use obligation, construction waste reduction, and sustainable construction methods. Furthermore, the analysis identified research frontiers in BPM, encompassing policy considerations (e.g., building efficiency policy, split incentive, carbon tax, and carbon pricing), energy-related aspects (e.g., consumption, green transition), political dimensions (e.g., governance, management), building-related factors (e.g., green building, retrofitting), the innovation system, and the evolutionary game. Based on these findings, this study suggests that future research in BPM can deepen insight into interdisciplinary policy mixes by focusing on policy strategies, processes, and features. This study contributes to a holistic understanding of BPM and offers insightful guidance for both researchers and practitioners seeking to advance sustainable practices in the building sector.

TI  - Closing the Affordable Housing Gap: Identifying the Barriers Hindering the Sustainable Design and Construction of Affordable Homes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the commitment of the United Nations (UN) to provide everyone with equal access to basic services, the construction sector still fails to reach the production capacity and quality standards which are needed to meet the fast-growing demand for affordable homes. Whilst innovation measures are urgently needed to address the existing inefficiencies, the identification and development of the most appropriate solutions require a comprehensive understanding of the barriers obstructing the design and construction phase of affordable housing. To identify such barriers, an exploratory data mining analysis was conducted in which agglomerative hierarchical clustering made it possible to gather latent knowledge from 3566 text-based research outputs sourced from the Web of Science and Scopus. The analysis captured 83 supply-side barriers which impact the efficiency of the value chain for affordable housing provision. Of these barriers, 18 affected the design and construction phase, and after grouping them by thematic area, seven key matters of concern were identified: (1) design (not) for all, (2) homogeneity of provision, (3) unhealthy living environment, (4) inadequate construction project management, (5) environmental unsustainability, (6) placemaking, and (7) inadequate technical knowledge and skillsets. The insights which resulted from the analysis were seen to support evidence-informed decision making across the affordable housing sector. The findings suggest that fixing the inefficiencies of the affordable housing provision system will require UN Member States to accelerate the transition towards a fully sustainable design and construction process. This transition should prioritize a more inclusive and socially sensitive approach to the design and construction of affordable homes, capitalizing on the benefits of greater user involvement. In addition, transformative actions which seek to deliver more resource-efficient and environmentally friendly homes should be promoted, as well as new investments in the training and upskilling of construction professionals.

AB  - In this article, multitrial vector-based differential evolution algorithm (MTDE) is proposed as energy and cost management controller under Time of Use (TOU) tariff in grid associated domestic PV-wind power system tied with battery storages. To enrich the energy efficiency of a proposed power system, two optimisation algorithms are proposed in the scheduling operation. TOU billing is a cost- reflective power pricing strategy that has been found as an effective way to reduce peak energy consumption in the residential segment everywhere the world, mainly in industrialised nations. In the optimisation maximizing the cost benefit of the household energy is taken as the objective and the dispatching ratio of electricity sold to the grid and used locally is treated as the optimisation variable. Using MATLAB, the performance of proposed MTDE in the aspect of daily cost benefit and revenue growth rate are presented with the comparative analysis of gravitational search algorithm and conventional self-made for self-consumed and rest for sale (SFC&RFS) mode-based energy management controller. In comparison to the SFC&RFS mode, the GSA-based cost optimization offers a 21.46% increase in revenue growth, while it is improved to 38.7% using proposed MTDE algorithm. The paper also addresses the significance of fuzzy logic based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of solar PV in enhancing the energy management of the proposed system. The prototype of fuzzy logic MPPT for 10 W solar panel is presented and the tracked maximum power is visualized using Thingspeak IoT cloud server. The tracking speed of the MPPT can be increased by introducing machine learning algorithms at the cost of memory and complexity. In this article, the linear regression-based machine learning algorithm is implemented in the hardware prototype by utilizing the dataset aggregated from fuzzy MPPT and hence the proposed MPPT inherits the characteristics of the fuzzy MPPT with increased tracking speed. Around 75 % data are used for training, 25% of data are used to test the model and it is observed that the root mean square error (rmse) is 5.1334 and mean square error is 26.3521 and the model is utilized as MPPT for the real-time inputs.

TI  - Techno-Economic Evaluation of Hydrogen-Based Cooking Solutions in Remote African Communities-The Case of Kenya
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrogen has recently been proposed as a versatile energy carrier to contribute to archiving universal access to clean cooking. In hard-to-reach rural settings, decentralized produced hydrogen may be utilized (i) as a clean fuel via direct combustion in pure gaseous form or blended with Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), or (ii) via power-to-hydrogen-to-power (P2H2P) to serve electric cooking (e-cooking) appliances. Here, we present the first techno-economic evaluation of hydrogen-based cooking solutions. We apply mathematical optimization via energy system modeling to assess the minimal cost configuration of each respective energy system on technical and economic measures under present and future parameters. We further compare the potential costs of cooking for the end user with the costs of cooking with traditional fuels. Today, P2H2P-based e-cooking and production of hydrogen for utilization via combustion integrated into the electricity supply system have almost equal energy system costs to simultaneously satisfy the cooking and electricity needs of the isolated rural Kenyan village studied. P2H2P-based e-cooking might become advantageous in the near future when improving the energy efficiency of e-cooking appliances. The economic efficiency of producing hydrogen for utilization by end users via combustion benefits from integrating the water electrolysis into the electricity supply system. More efficient and cheaper hydrogen technologies expected by 2050 may improve the economic performance of integrated hydrogen production and utilization via combustion to be competitive with P2H2P-based e-cooking. The monthly costs of cooking per household may be lower than the traditional use of firewood and charcoal even today when applying the current life-line tariff for the electricity consumed or utilizing hydrogen via combustion. Driven by likely future technological improvements and the expected increase in traditional and fossil fuel prices, any hydrogen-based cooking pathway may be cheaper for end users than using charcoal and firewood by 2030, and LPG by 2040. The results suggest that providing clean cooking in rural villages could economically and environmentally benefit from utilizing hydrogen. However, facing the complexity of clean cooking projects, we emphasize the importance of embedding the results of our techno-economic analysis in holistic energy delivery models. We propose useful starting points for future aspects to be investigated in the discussion section, including business and financing models.

TI  - Sustainability framework of intelligent social houses with a synergy of double-facade architecture and active air conditioning systems
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Social houses are built around the world to fulfill the basic needs of the growing population, especially middle-income families. Owing to the low budget available for such houses around the globe, necessary energy codes are often compromised. This research, through a methodological sustainability framework, presents the case study of Mexico with the objective to address this worldwide issue. More than 100,000 social houses were built in Mexico just in the year 2021 without strictly following any definitive building energy codes. Eventually, this is a ticking bomb, if left unaddressed, that can bring serious energy and environmental consequences connected with various social issues. Thus, as a research gap, the conventional 4E (energy, exergy, economic, and environmental) analysis cannot fully address such a complex energy-environmental-economic-social nexus. This work proposes an integrated sustainability framework of the practicability of the bioclimatic architecture of such a social house including energy, economic, environmental, and social assessment (novel addition to the analysis). The novel methodology is implemented on a novel technological advancement where double-facade architecture (i.e., solar chimney) is installed through a synergy and intelligent operation with an active air conditioning system including a desiccant enhanced air cooler and novel dew-point evaporative cooler. The article makes use of conventional physics-based modeling of thermal machines combined with an artificial neural network digital twin-based data-driven non-sorting genetic optimization of solar chimneys for various climatic conditions of Mexico. The optimal points are evaluated using annual climatic data to maintain the thermal comfort conditions and the results have suggested an increase of-48% through intelligent integration of double-facade architecture with the Maisotsenko cycle air cooler. Life-cycle economic assessment has suggested the Levelized cost of air conditioning be between 0.0096 and 0.0390 USD/kWh and can save up to-273 MXN per month with a real payback period of-8 years. Environment assessment has reported mitigation of up to-5668.59 kgCO2/year as compared to conventional vapor compression refrigeration systems. The social assessment is conducted on a pilot scale to directly ask the people of Mexico about their perception of the installation of the solar chimney while giving the fact that the initial price of the social houses can increase between 2.5 and 4%. It is reported that-62% of the sample is willing to install it even with a high price tag with a motive to initiate the climate change mitigation phenomena. The importance of the work has concluded that the government needs to take drastic and tough decisions to further regulate the energy efficiency in the social houses and limit the constructors to offer sustainable building construction.

AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The method involves creating a demand response                multi-objective optimization model using machine                learning techniques, where the model considers                various parameters such as an energy consumption                pattern of a household, pricing of electricity at                different times of a day, and a weather forecast.                An optimized load scheduling is provided in                real-time to the household through an integrated                smart home system. The model is optimized through                feedback from household load scheduling data and                feedback from a utility company. Multiple                objectives such as cost, energy consumption, and                user preferences, are considered by the demand                response optimization model.
                    USE - Method for optimizing residential load                scheduling through a demand response                multi-objective optimization model in a residential                building.
                    ADVANTAGE - The system is designed to help homeowners                reduce their energy consumption and costs while                also minimizing the impact of their energy use on                the power grid. The model uses historical energy                usage data to develop load scheduling strategies                that minimize energy costs and peak demand while                maintaining user comfort.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network-Based Generative Design Optimization of the Energy Performance of Florida Single-Family Houses
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The energy efficiency optimization of Florida's residential buildings is essential for the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This optimization requires designers to accurately calculate the building energy loads at the design stage to efficiently design the cooling and heating systems. However, due to time and cost constraints, designers usually explore only a few design alternatives and simulate their energy use. This study developed an artificial-neural-network (ANN)-based generative design (GD) framework to automate the design process of detached residences while optimizing their energy performance. The ANN model was developed using the machine learning platform TensorFlow and some Python-based Keras libraries based on a big data set of about 17,000 newly constructed detached residences in Florida between the years 2009 and 2021. The GD framework was established using Autodesk Dynamo and the Autodesk Revit GD add-on that uses the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), in which multiple design parameters mainly relating to the house geometry and its energy performance were incorporated. Considering 10 independent variables, including the total wall area, roof area, floor area, and the windows' U-value, the ANN model predicted the required capacities of the cooling and heating systems in detached houses, with R2 values of 0.955 and 0.904, respectively. The ANN then was integrated within the GD framework for performance evaluation purposes. The findings of this study resulted in a fully automated 3-min design process of an energy-efficient detached house envelope, maximizing the productivity of designers and developers and greatly reducing the financial strain and time consumed using traditional techniques.

TI  - English Housing Survey, 2014: Housing Stock Data: Special Licence Access
T2  - UK Data Archive
M3  - Data set
AB  - Abstract copyright UK Data Service and data collection copyright owner.The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) that collects information about people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of housing in England. The EHS brings together two previous survey series into a single fieldwork operation: the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33158) and the Survey of English Housing (SEH) (available under GN 33277). The EHS covers all housing tenures and provides valuable information and evidence to inform the development and monitoring of the department's housing policies. Results from the survey are also used by a wide range of other users including other government departments, local authorities, housing associations, landlords, academics, construction industry professionals, consultants, and the general public. The EHS has a complex multi-stage methodology consisting of two main elements; an initial interview survey of around 14,000 households and a follow-up physical inspection. Some further elements are also periodically included in or derived from the EHS: for 2008 and 2009, a desk-based market valuation was conducted of a sub-sample of 8,000 dwellings (including vacant ones), but this was not carried out from 2010 onwards. A periodic follow-up survey of private landlords and agents (the Private Landlords Survey (PLS)) is conducted using information from the EHS interview survey. Fuel Poverty datasets are also available from 2003, created by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC). The EHS interview survey sample formed part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) (available from the Archive under GN 33420) from April 2008 to April 2011. During this period the core questions from the IHS formed part of the EHS questionnaire. End User Licence and Special Licence Versions: From 2014 data onwards, the End User Licence (EUL) versions of the EHS only include derived variables. In addition the number of variables on the EUL datasets from that date has been reduced and disclosure control increased on certain remaining variables. The new Special Licence versions of the EHS, which are subject to more restrictive access conditions, are of a similar nature to EHS EUL datasets prior to 2014 and include both derived and raw datasets. Further information about the EHS and the latest news, reports and tables can be found on the GOV.UK English Housing Survey web pages. The English Housing Survey, 2014: Housing Stock Data: Special Licence Access is available for all cases where a physical survey has been completed. For occupied cases the data comprises information from the household interview and from the physical survey. For vacant properties only, data from the physical survey are provided. The Special Licence version includes raw interview and physical datasets and derived data, whereas the EUL version (SN 8010) only includes derived variables. Users are advised to obtain SN 8010 to see whether it is suitable for their needs before making an application for the Special Licence version. The data are made available for a two-year rolling sample i.e. approximately 12,000 cases together with the appropriate two-year weights. For example, the EHS Housing Stock results presented here are for 2014, but cover the period April 2013 to March 2015. This means that if you use more than one housing stock dataset, you must use either odd or even years. For example, you need to use the Housing Stock Dataset for '2012' and '2014' or '2013' and '2015', but not the dataset for '2014' and '2013' as you would double-count the cases surveyed between April 2013 and March 2014. The Housing Stock dataset should be used for any analysis requiring information relating to the physical characteristics and energy efficiency of the housing stock. Derived datasets provide key analytical variables compiled post-fieldwork including energy efficiency ratings, decent home indicators and equivalised income. Users who only require data from the household interview should use the English Housing Survey, 2014-2015: Household Data EUL or Special Licence versions (SNs 8009 and 8067 respectively). Latest Edition Information For the third edition (March 2017), the physical data file has been updated; cavity wall insulation variables wallinsy and wins90x have been replaced and new cavity wall insulation variable wins95x added. For the fourth edition (March 2020), the Market Value Survey (MVS) data have been added in a new file MVS_SL.sav. This file contains the additional market value variables (valout, valwith) and grosing factors to be used with these variables (aagpd1314_mvs, aagph1314_mvs). Full details on using MVS data are now provided in the accompanying documentation (8068_mvs_technical_report_2015.pdf, 8068_user_guide_mvs_sl.pdf). Further information: In compliance with Building Regulations, an increasing proportion of dwellings built in 1991 or after with cavity walls had cavity wall insulation fitted at the time of construction (known as as built' insulation), although compliance could also be achieved through other techniques. The non-intrusive survey undertaken in the EHS would not always be able to identify as built insulation (though the surveyor might have found out from the occupant), so dwellings built in 1991 or after with cavity walls with no evidence of insulation in the survey have been assumed to be insulated. The category 'cavity walls with evidence of insulation' includes both dwellings with evidence of cavity wall insulation (e.g. drill holes or information from occupants) and those built in 2003 or after. A separate category identifies cavity walled dwellings built in 1991 or after where no evidence of cavity wall insulation was seen by the surveyors and where no assumptions have been made based on the construction date. This category therefore includes dwellings built in 1991 or after up to and including in 2002, with no evidence of CWI from the physical survey. In the original 2014-15 data the assumption had been changed from 2003 or after to properties built in 1996 or after (in alignment with rdSAP assumptions), but to preserve the time series, the EHS team have reverted back to the original assumption, hence the variable replacement. For this years Headline Report a new variable for cavity wall insulation was introduced (wins95x - this has been added to EHS physical files from 2007/8 (SN 6612) onwards). From the submission of the 2015 data wins95x will replace wins90x. Main Topics: The EHS Housing Stock survey consists of two components, and one additional dataset. Interview Survey An interview is first conducted with the householder. The interview topics include: household characteristics, satisfaction with the home and the area, disability and adaptations to the home, ownership and rental details and income details. All interviewees are guaranteed confidentiality and all data are anonymised. Physical Survey Where interviews were achieved (the 'full household sample'), each year all rented properties and a sub-sample of owner occupied properties are regarded as eligible for the physical survey and the respondents consent is sought. A proportion of vacant properties were also sub-sampled. For these cases a visual inspection of the property, both internal and external is carried out by a qualified surveyor. Market Value SurveyProperties in the 2015 MVS consisted of the most recent two years' of sampled data (2013-14 and 2014-15) from the EHS 'physical survey'. The MVS supplied two valuations as at 1 October 2015, assuming vacant possession: for the actual condition, and assuming any defects are rectified. Additional information was provided by the Valuations Office Agency relating to the property market conditions for the area in which each sampled dwelling was located. © Crown copyright.

AB  - 
                   NOVELTY - The variable volume cultivation house (A) has                a volume control unit (100) that is configured in                cultivation space and made of an elastic material.                A gas supply unit (200) is configured to supply gas                to the volume control unit and control a supply                amount and a discharge amount of the gas. The                volume control unit (300) controls an operation of                the gas supply unit, and a sagging prevention unit                is provided to pull the volume control unit toward                an inner surface including a ceiling surface, a                wall surface and a floor surface of the cultivation                house (H). A heating and cooling unit supplies                controlled air to control a cultivation environment                of the cultivation space.
                    USE - Variable volume cultivation house for                cultivating crops in the greenhouse cultivation                field, indoor agriculture field, smart farm field,                and plant factory field.
                    ADVANTAGE - The house minimizes space waste in an inner                side of the cultivation house when cultivating                crops using cultivation houses e.g. greenhouses,                plant factories, and smart farms so as to reduce                cultivation costs and improve energy efficiency by                separating and cultivating the minimum space                required for growth of target crops among the                spaces of the inner sides of the house. The volume                control unit is configured as a balloon inside the                house, and changes the volume of the volume inside                the housing by adjusting the size of the size                control unit, so that the cultivation space for                target crops that require cooling, heating and air                conditioning can be minimized. The house reduces                energy costs required for growing crops, such as                fuel costs and electricity usage costs, and                improves price competitiveness of the crops.

AB  - Abstract copyright UK Data Service and data collection copyright owner.The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Ministry of Housing, Community and Local Government (MHCLG) that collects information about people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of housing in England. The EHS brings together two previous survey series into a single fieldwork operation: the English House Condition Survey (EHCS) (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33158) and the Survey of English Housing (SEH) (available under GN 33277). The EHS covers all housing tenures. The information obtained through the survey provides an accurate picture of people living in the dwelling, and their views on housing and their neighbourhoods.The survey is also used to inform the development and monitoring of the Ministry's housing policies. Results from the survey are also used by a wide range of other users including other government departments, local authorities, housing associations, landlords, academics, construction industry professionals, consultants, and the general public. The EHS has a complex multi-stage methodology consisting of two main elements; an initial interview survey of around 12,000 households and a follow-up physical inspection. Some further elements are also periodically included in or derived from the EHS: for 2008 and 2009, a desk-based market valuation was conducted of a sub-sample of 8,000 dwellings (including vacant ones), but this was not carried out from 2010 onwards. A periodic follow-up survey of private landlords and agents (the Private Landlords Survey (PLS)) is conducted using information from the EHS interview survey. Fuel Poverty datasets are also available from 2003, created by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC). The EHS interview survey sample formed part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) (available from the Archive under GN 33420) from April 2008 to April 2011. During this period the core questions from the IHS formed part of the EHS questionnaire. End User Licence and Special Licence Versions: From 2014 data onwards, the End User Licence (EUL) versions of the EHS will only include derived variables. In addition the number of variables on the new EUL datasets has been reduced and disclosure control increased on certain remaining variables. New Special Licence versions of the EHS will be deposited later in the year, which will be of a similar nature to previous EHS EUL datasets and will include derived and raw datasets. Further information about the EHS and the latest news, reports and tables can be found on the GOV.UK English Housing Survey web pages.

The data from the physical survey are available under SN 9058 -English Housing Survey, 2020: Housing Stock Data.Due to changes to the methodology in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, both the achieved full interview (household) and dwelling (stock) samples in 2020-21 were smaller than in a normal year, at 7,474 households and 5,228 dwellings respectively. Vacant dwellings were not surveyed in 2020-21 because social distancing restrictions prevented interviewers from visiting the sampled addresses to identify them. Further details about the key changes made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are included in the Technical Report available as part of the study documentation. Main Topics: The EHS Housing survey consists of two components.Interview survey on the participating household -An interview is first conducted with the householder. The interview topics include: household characteristics, satisfaction with the home and the area, disability and adaptations to the home, ownership and rental details and income details. All interviewees are guaranteed confidentiality and all data is anonymised.Physical survey on the housing Stock -A visual inspection of both the interior and exterior of the dwelling is carried out by a qualified surveyor to assess the condition and energy efficiency of the dwelling. Topics covered include whether the dwelling meets the Decent Homes Standard; cost to make the dwelling decent; existence of damp and Category 1 Hazards as measured by the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS); Energy Efficiency Rating. The physical survey is carried out on the dwelling of a sub-sample of the participants of the interview survey. The sub-sample consists of the dwelling of participants living in private or socialrented properties and a sub-sample of those in owner occupied properties.

Further information about the EHS and the latest news, reports and tables can be found on the GOV.UK English Housing Survey web pages. The English Housing Survey, 2020: Housing Stock Data includes data from a two-year rolling sample with the appropriate two-year weights, and covers the period April 2019 to March 2021.Fieldwork was suspended between April and June 2020 because of restrictions introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and, for the same reason, carrying out face-to-face fieldwork was not possible for the remainder of the year. The EHS was therefore carried out over a reduced fieldwork period between July, 2020 and April, 2021 using a 'push-to-telephone' approach and an 'external plus' physical survey where internal inspections of properties were replaced with external inspections, where the inspection was restricted to an assessment of the exterior of the dwelling and supplemented by information about the interior of the dwelling the surveyor collected (socially distanced) at the doorstep.Some of the raw data required for modelling could not be collected, in which case predictive modelled estimates at dwelling level were produced to indicate whether or not a dwelling: had damp problems; had any Category 1 hazards assessed through the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS); or met the Decent Homes Standard.

TI  - Fuel poverty and child mental health: exploring underlying mechanisms and experiences in order to reduce inequalities
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - As the UK experiences the worst cost of living crisis in decades (ONS, 2022) estimates suggest that by January over 50% of households (15 million) will be fuel poor (Bradshaw & Keung, 2022). Definitions of fuel poverty (FP) vary globally (Thomson & Snell, 2016), even within the UK, nations disagree (Hinson & Bolton 2022). In England, officially a household is in FP if it has an energy efficiency rating of band D or below and a disposable income under the poverty line (60% below median household income) after housing and fuel costs (BEIS, 2021). It is intersections of society's most vulnerable, including children who are at the greatest risk of ill health due to FP (PHE, 2017; Liddell & Morris, 2010; Marmot et al 2011). Research suggests links between FP and poor adult mental health (Liddell & Morris, 2010; Marmot at el. 2011) but for children the focus has been on physical health with evidence suggesting an increased likelihood of respiratory problems such as asthma (Mohan, 2021). Emergent literature has linked FP to poor child mental health (CMH) (Oliveras et al., 2021) however mechanisms remain unclear with more research needed to understand UK children's experiences. This research aims to understand what factors explain the relationship between FP and CMH and what can be done to reduce or stop their impact. Findings will provide evidence for policy makers, researchers and practitioners on interventions to use, where to target them and who would benefit from them. Research Questions 1. How does FP impact MH trajectories of children? 2. What factors explain (mediate or moderate) the relationship between FP and CMH outcomes? 3. What is the lived experience of FP for children and their families and how does this relate to CMH? Three linked studies will generate evidence to inform policy and practices to reduce the impact of FP on CMH outcomes. It will be conducted in collaboration with the Bradford Institute for Health Research, using primary (Study 3) and secondary (Study 2) data from the Born in Bradford (BiB) Study. BiB is a large cohort study established in 2007, tracking the development of babies born in the city of Bradford from childhood into adulthood (Wright et al., 2013). It recruited 12,453 pregnant women between 2007 and 2011 capturing information on genetic, nutritional, environmental and social factors with subsets of families contributing to numerous BiB data sweeps since recruitment. Study 1 A systematic review will be produced to establish a theoretical framework describing the mechanisms through which FP impacts CMH. Guided by Baxter et al. (2010), a logic model will be developed and tested in Study 2. Understanding factors that mediate and moderate the relationship between FP and CMH provides a rationale guided by theory for policy and practice change. Study 2 Little is known about how early life experiences of FP impact the emergence and trajectory of CMH outcomes. Using repeated measures analysis, this study will explore how exposure to FP at pregnancy/birth and early childhood (4/5 years) contribute to the development of CMH symptoms in early and middle childhood. A further analysis will be conducted using structural equation modelling to test hypothesised mediating variables based on literature searches and the logic model. Collectively these analyses will generate evidence on types of interventions to use, where to target them and who would benefit from them. Study 3 Interviews will be conducted with fuel poor children from the BiB cohort and their parents. Drawing on Butler and Sheriff's (2017) methodological approach interpretative phenomenological analysis (Smith et al., 2009) will be used to understand how children and their families relate to and make sense of experiences of FP. Findings will be interrogated alongside studies 1&2 producing a theory of change model to inform future policy and practice for children and families living with or at risk of FP.

TI  - NNA Research: Collaborative Research: Responding to Energy Insecurity in Arctic Housing Using a Community-Based Participatory Research
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. This Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among social systems, natural environment, and built environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic Residents, Data and Observations, Education, Forecasting, and Resilient Infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to address the substantial existing and emerging housing challenges that rural Alaskan communities currently face. Specifically, many homes in these communities are highly energy inefficient; many others were not designed for the harsh Alaskan climate; many are old and overcrowded. The high cost of electricity and heating fuel combined with these housing challenges makes many rural Alaskan homes highly energy burdened (i.e. a high percentage of household income is used for energy costs). The most vulnerable households are estimated to spend nearly half of their income on energy bills. These challenges are worsened by the changing climate conditions. Government-funded programs to improve the efficiency of homes have been ongoing for many years, however, in some cases these efficiency improvements are not being used by households, and/or are not performing as intended. There is currently limited research on why this occurs, and solutions that can help to address this. Therefore, this research seeks to, in collaboration with three rural Alaskan communities and a diversity of key non-profits and other stakeholders, identify better, more culturally appropriate ways to adapt rural Alaskan housing to alleviate energy burden. Many will benefit from the results of this effort, including Alaskan homeowners, society as a whole, and the scientific community. Specifically, current and future homeowners in these communities will benefit from energy efficiency programs that are better designed to fit their cultural values and interests, making the homeowners more likely to benefit from participation. This will also improve the wellbeing of communities by reducing stresses related to energy costs through methods that support socio-cultural and environmental connections. Society will benefit from programs designed to achieve the maximum long-term energy and emissions reductions, thus maximizing the benefits of the use of public money. The scientific community will benefit from this research through the better understanding of key factors influencing the long-term success of energy efficiency improvements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research effort seeks to answer the following research questions: How can existing Alaska Native housing be adapted to better alleviate energy insecurity? How effective are existing energy efficiency retrofit methods, and how can they be improved to reduce long-term energy burden? The response to these research questions is obtained using a community-based participatory research in the villages of Unalakleet, Nome, and Quinhagak. Through six interlinked tasks, the research team will collaboratively develop improvement strategies that incorporate cultural beliefs and values, field data collection, and integrated building energy models which together address identified causes of energy burden for existing housing. Task 1 will establish the methods for knowledge co-production and collaboration with the communities.  Task 2 will use climate model outputs and surface weather station data along with community interviews, to construct future climate scenarios for each community. Task 3 will assess the characteristics, efficiency, and long-term performance of homes, including those with and without retrofits. Through buildings validated energy models, it will also quantify the factors driving energy burden, and the impacts energy efficiency improvements have had on energy burden. Task 4 will assess the cultural values and beliefs that members of rural Alaskan communities have around energy use and energy efficient technology, resulting in an understanding of cultural barriers and opportunities for energy efficiency improvement implementation. Task 5 will identify retrofit strategies which both reduce energy burden considering future climate scenarios, and fit Alaska Native cultural values and beliefs. It will also recommend the need for improvements to energy efficiency implementation, including design changes and/or energy education. The final task will develop energy engineering curriculum which will be implemented in K-12 and higher education classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

TI  - The Energy Efficiency Gap in the Rental Housing Market: It Takes Both Sides to Build a Bridge
T2  - ENERGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We revisit the issue of the energy efficiency (EE) gap by explicitly acknowledg-ing the two-sided nature of the rental housing market and two-sided asymmetries of information between tenants and landlords. Employing a theoretical matching model, we show that Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) that signal a dwell-ing's energy performance induce optimal EE investments by landlords only if ten-ants pay their energy expenditures in full. When landlords pay part of the energy expenditures, they seek tenants who will conserve energy. Our model shows that asymmetry of information over tenant characteristics results in suboptimally low investments in EE. This may even render EPCs counterproductive. As a remedy, we show that tenant-side signaling needs to be rolled out jointly with EPCs and may even be sufficient when contracts include energy expenditures. Data from an original survey provides support for these insights and suggests that information on the tenants' side contributes to more EE investment.

TI  - The Price Premium in Green Buildings: A Spatial Autoregressive Model and a Multi-Criteria Optimization Approach
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The energy issue has given rise to a prolific research field, which branches into several strands. One of these strands focuses on the role played by building energy features in shaping property prices. Indeed, market players are expected to show a higher willingness to pay for building units characterized by higher energy performance. The study of the so-called price premium for building energy efficiency has flourished in the last decade or so; plenty of evidence is now available concerning its occurrence, although its magnitude is still debated. The literature relies on the methodological frameworks of statistical modeling and multiple regression, primarily employing hedonic price models. Lately, spatial autoregressive models have also been adopted. Here, we propose to deal with estimation of the price premium by adopting an innovative perspective. In particular, we use a methodological framework in which regression models are complemented with a multi-criteria optimization approach. Using a spatial autoregressive model first, and with D as the reference energy rating band, we find the following price premiums: 55% for A4, 42% for A3 to A, 20% for B or C, -14% for F, and -29% for G. The multi-criteria optimization approach proves efficient in estimating the price premium. The estimates above are essentially confirmed: the results converge for all the energy rating bands except for G.

TI  - The impact of energy certificates on sales and rental prices: a comparative analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThe current literature on energy certificates shows that Energy Performance Certificate labels have an important effect on real estate prices. However, interestingly, the limited studies that address the rental market find significantly lower price premiums than the sales market. The purpose of this paper is to add to this literature, by doing a comparative analysis of price premiums in the sales and rental market in Flanders (Belgium). Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a hedonic regression model to analyze 177,670 real estate listings between 2016 and 2021. The data is provided by Immoweb - the largest online real estate platform in Belgium. The data set was divided in sold and rented properties: the authors evaluated 126,217 sales listings and 51,453 rent listings. FindingsThe results confirm that energy efficient properties generate a price premium, but that this premium is significantly larger in the sales market than in the rental market. In addition, the findings indicate that both investors and landlords could benefit strongly from renovating dwellings - especially when renovating from an F label to an A label. Originality/valuePrevious research focuses strongly on the sales market, although in many countries the rental market is similar in size and responsible from much energy consumption. Interestingly, the few studies that are addressing the rental market, find singificantly smaller price premiums than in the sales market. The findings add to this literature tradition and offer a comparative analysis of price premiums in the sales and rental market in Flanders. This allows us to not only show the similarities between both markets but also highlight the differences - creating valuable insights for academia, governments and real estate professionals.

TI  - The effectiveness of climate change regulations in the commercial real estate market
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Legislation to increase building energy efficiency is a key climate change policy instrument in many countries. Although most of these regulations concern the housing stock, office buildings are also a considerable source of greenhouse gas emissions. Office markets face fewer pricing regulations than the residential market and may thus provide a clearer pricing signal of any policy impacts. This paper focusses on the introduction of Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) in England and Wales. Applying machine-learning methods, Difference in Differences (DiD) and Fixed Effects (FE) panel data estimation to a comprehensive database of the London office market, our results suggest that the MEES policy has had a measurable and significant impact and lowered the rents of the combined group of affected office units by 6-8% following the announcement of MEES and in the run-up to implementation. A weakly significant 4.4% rental discount is detected for the bordering but unaffected class of EPC E-rated office buildings relative to the A-C EPC group, perhaps due to market expectations of a further expansion of MEES.

TI  - Building Sustainability, Certification, and Price Premiums: Evidence from Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - We examine how green certification impacts cashflows and transaction prices in the Western European office markets of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. We address sample selection bias by setting up a balanced panel matching sustainable-certified with noncertified buildings using various matching approaches. We find a statistically significant green building premium for properties in our sample. For certified properties, operating income and transaction prices are higher by approximately 12% and 10%, respectively. This premium is robust by country and higher for platinum- and gold-certified properties. Moreover, our examination at the market level indicates that the observed premium is not driven solely by markets with a limited supply of sustainable buildings. Additionally, the premium does not show a declining trend over time, but rather responds to market conditions. Notably, substantial heterogeneity in both cashflow and price premiums exists across countries and markets.

TI  - Impact of energy efficiency information on homebuying searches: evidence from a visual choice experiment in the USA
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
M3  - Article
AB  - A lack of specificity exists on whether likely homebuyers utilize home energy efficiency information in future home searches. This study addresses this gap using a visual choice experiment to sample 1538 intended homebuyers in the USA, and the preference for home attributes through a simplified real estate website. Each home presented on the website featured six attributes: price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, number of days on the market, energy efficiency, and a photo - each relative to participants' initial specification of location, preferred price, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The respondents were assigned to one of six experimental conditions where energy information was provided as (i) estimated annual energy costs, (ii) home energy score (number only), (iii) home energy score along a continuum, (iv) estimated annual energy costs and energy score along a continuum, (v) home energy scores provided for only above average homes, and (vi) no energy information provided (control). We find that homebuyers are more likely to select energy efficient homes when presented with any form of energy efficiency information, with conditions that include home energy scores providing the greatest increase in energy efficiency. Furthermore, this preference for energy efficiency information persists even under less-than-ideal home searches. The preference for energy efficient homes is influenced by type of home and region with detached homebuyers and homebuyers in the Midwest US Census region more likely to select homes featuring higher energy efficiency scores. Finally, we find that rural homebuyers are more likely to prefer energy efficient homes over urban homebuyers.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeCorporate real estate management (CREM) is complex due to an increasing number of real estate (RE) added values and the tensions between them. RE managers are faced with trade-offs: to choose a higher performance for one added value at the cost of another. CREM research mainly deals with trade-offs in a hypothetical sense, without looking at the characteristics of the RE portfolio nor the specific context in which trade-offs are made. The purpose of this paper is to further develop the concept of real estate value (REV) optimisation with regard to tensions between decreasing CO2 emissions and supporting user activities.Design/methodology/approachMixed method study. REV optimisation between user activities and energy efficiency for police stations in the Netherlands built between 2000 and 2020 is analysed. This is complemented by interviews with an RE manager and senior user of police stations and analysis of policy documents.FindingsxThe characteristics of the police station portfolio indicate no correlation between user activities and energy efficiency for the case studied. This is complemented by interviews, from which it becomes clear that there was in fact little tension between supporting user activities and energy efficiency. The performances of these two different added values were optimised separately.Originality/valueThis study combines different scales (building and portfolio level) with different types of data: portfolio analysis, document analysis and interviews. This creates a comprehensive image of whether and how the Netherlands police optimised the two RE values.

TI  - Homeowners' Perceptions of Renewable Energy and Market Value of Sustainable Buildings
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing concerns over environmental issues and sustainable living have resulted in increased interest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The real estate market is no exception, with homeowners increasingly considering the market value of green and sustainable buildings, which can offer both energy efficiency and potential health benefits. This study investigates the level of interest among homeowners in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures for their homes and how it relates to their perception of the market value of green or sustainable buildings in the real estate market. A survey was conducted in the Paphos urban complex in Cyprus, with 180 participants over the age of 18. The participants were selected through a random sampling method and were representative of the general population in terms of gender, age, and income. Data were collected on their attitudes towards renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, as well as their perceptions of the market value of green buildings. The data collected were analyzed using various statistical methods, including Cronbach's a coefficient, the non-parametric Friedman test, descriptive statistics, and factor analysis, with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) being used for coding and analysis. Results indicate that 64% of the homeowners surveyed were interested in investing in renewable energy sources, and 72% were interested in energy efficiency measures. Additionally, findings suggest a moderate level of interest (58%) among homeowners in investing in renewable energy sources and that this is positively associated with their perception of the market value of green buildings. Furthermore, homeowners with higher income and education levels tend to be more interested in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures and perceive green buildings as having higher market value. This study provides insights into the factors that drive homeowners' investment in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, shedding light on the relationship between homeowners' perceptions of the market value of green buildings and their interest in such investments.

T2  - ISCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrofitting existing buildings is crucial for achieving Net Zero emissions. Institu-tional real estate owners play a key role because of their significant ownership, espe-cially of large buildings. We utilize an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate cost -optimal decarbonization conditions for three Swiss real estate portfolios owned by a global institutional investor. We leverage a bottom-up optimization framework for building asset retrofitting, scaled to the portfolio-level, to study the effect of pol-icy scenarios and implementations. Results indicate that achieving Net Zero necessi-tates significant investments, largely through thermal energy efficiency measures and low-CO2 energy systems, as early as possible to avoid locked-in emissions. Owners will be challenged to smooth long-term capital investments, pointing to a potential liquidity crisis. Consequently, hard-to-decarbonize assets are unable to reach regulatory benchmarks largely because of lingering embodied emissions. To lower transition risk, we recommend that policymakers move toward average CO2 benchmarks at the real estate portfolio-level, emulating automotive fleets.

TI  - Urban Disparities in Energy Performance Premium Prices: Towards an Unjust Transition?
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, numerous studies have explored how energy and environmental performance impact property values. Superior energy efficiency is the basis for value disparities in real estate markets. However, measurements of these variations vary significantly. This research aims to investigate the relationship between market size and vitality and market value differences. This has significant implications for the nature of the energy transition, potentially determining fairness or inequality. The study considers the real estate market in six Italian cities: three metropolitan (Milan, Turin, and Florence) and three medium-sized cities (Padua, Mestre, and Bergamo). The sample includes 2935 properties. In metropolitan cities, hedonic pricing models confirm the relevance of energy performance in market value formation, highlighting a potential depreciation in property values by up to 30% between properties belonging to the highest energy class (A) compared to the lowest (G), and 14% between class D and G. Such premium gaps are halved in medium-sized cities. Conclusions foresee a scenario of socially and economically unjust transition that must be considered in policies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings, with a specific concern for the nature and characteristics of the real estate markets involved.

AB  - As the global imperative for sustainable development intensifies, the real estate industry stands at the intersection of environmental responsibility and economic viability. This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the significance of sustainable solutions within the real estate sector, employing advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to assess their impact. This study focuses on the integration of AI-powered tools in a decision-making process analysis. The research methodology involves the development and implementation of AI algorithms capable of analyzing vast datasets related to real estate attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the algorithm assesses the significance of energy efficiency solutions along with other intrinsic and extrinsic attributes. This paper examines the effectiveness of these solutions in relation to the influence on property prices with a framework based on an AI-driven algorithm. The findings aim to inform real estate professionals and investors about the tangible advantages of integrating AI technologies into sustainable solutions, promoting a more informed and responsible approach to industry practices. This research contributes to the growing interest in the connection of the real estate sector, sustainability, and AI, offering insights that can guide strategic decision making. By implementing the random forest method in the real estate feature significance assessment original methodology, it has been shown that AI-powered algorithms can be a useful tool from the perspective of real estate price prediction. The methodology's ability to handle non-linear relationships and provide insights into feature importance proved advantageous in comparison to the multiple regression analysis.

TI  - Barriers to energy-efficient design and construction practices: A comprehensive analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of the world demands a shift towards more energy-efficient practices, particularly in the construction industry, which still largely relies on unsustainable methods. This study aims to identify and analyze the barriers hindering the adoption of energy-efficient design practices from the perspective of United States developers. Through an extensive literature review, barriers were categorized into financial, informational, and administrative themes, with nine sub-categories. In this research 115 papers were evaluated and among them 49 papers were selected to find the barriers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with local real estate developers to validate and further explore the identified barriers. For the interview 5 developers were invited to gain their insights in energy-efficient design and construction adoption. Financial barriers pose challenges in accurately valuing above-baseline energy efficiency, leading to uncertainties and financial risks for developers in a rapidly changing resale market. Informational gaps among key stakeholders hinder informed decision-making, with limited time and asymmetric in-formation hindering the adoption of energy-efficient measures. Administrative barriers, shaped by government policies, play a dual role in promoting and hindering energy efficiency. The most critical theme reported by developers was informational barriers, particularly emphasizing the importance of owner education as a key leverage point. To address these barriers effectively, the study recommends a concentrated effort on public education and government incentives, along-side the establishment of stringent energy efficiency standards in building codes. Future research should also involve other stakeholders within the industry to gain a more comprehensive under-standing of energy efficiency adoption and explore effective strategies for promoting sustainable practices in real estate development.

AB  - Sustainable urban development has come to play an essential role in establishing and growing future sustainable cities, or smart cities, which are urban areas that have an optimum carbon footprint, are nature-friendly, and are smart enough to enhance energy efficiency. This study is based on qualitative research in which data were collected from interviews with real estate development specialists. The interviews were addressed to a total of 30 real estate developers from Romania between July and December 2022 and were conducted using the Zoom interface. The aim of this research was to analyze whether familiarity with the smart green concept influences the decision to implement the IoT on a large scale at the organizational level through the perception of specific determining factors in choosing the development of green building projects considering the operational costs. The results revealed a significant indirect effect of green building knowledge on large-scale IoT implementation through the mediator of the perception of operating cost factors, supporting our hypothesis. The direct effect in the presence of the mediator was not found to be significant anymore. Hence, there is full complementary mediation by the perception of operating cost factors on the relationship between green building knowledge and large-scale IoT implementation.

TI  - From the ideal to the real in energy efficiency in social housing: the case of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico
T2  - CONTEXTO-REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE ARQUITECTURA UNIVERSIDAD AUTONOMA DE NUEVO LEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Individuals living in areas exposed to meteorological phenomena, lacking infrastructure and essential services, will be mostly affected by the risks of climate change. The adoption of mitigation measures is urgent in the search to reduce the impact on future generations, and the housing sector is an affordable way to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This would have an impact on the real estate market, so construction, urban planning and real estate valuation professionals should pay attention to the research on mitigation actions currently established in the energy transition process. This paper compares the energy use between the social housing with energy efficiency for a warm-dry climate and the predominant housing in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora; in order to know the difference in their GHG emissions. The process consisted of 1) Defining a methodology to determine a baseline; 2) Determine a baseline for energy efficiency in the analyzed climate; 3) Select the predominant housing prototype in the study site; 4) Estimate the use of energy and the emissions released in both scenarios. Revealing that the predominant social housing releases a volume of emissions of about 40% higher than the housing that meets the energy efficiency parameters established in the actual codes and Mexican standards, therefore, could be a feasible way to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions.

TI  - Rental and sales price premiums for energy efficiency in Germany's pre-War apartments: Where are the shortfalls and what is society's role in bringing fairness?
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing energy efficiency in residential buildings brings the social benefits of CO2 emissions reduction, increased energy security, reduced energy poverty and better public health, but is costly. The question arises as to who should pay for these social benefits: tenants, property owners, or society? The issues are complicated by the fact that the direct costs and benefits of energy-efficiency renovation are influenced by real estate markets. These market effects need to be better understood so that social costs, subsidies and CO2 taxes can be more fairly apportioned. As a case study, this paper investigates sales and rental market premiums for energy efficiency in 2019-2021 among the 6 million apartments in Germany that were built in 1800-1945, using a database from Germany's largest real estate portal. These apartments are notoriously energy inefficient, and their architecture and elegance can make energy-efficiency retrofitting difficult and expensive. Using least squares regression analyses, it finds that sales premiums for energy efficiency generally compensated owners who retrofitted then sold, were too low to compensate landlords/landladies for retrofitting, and too high for tenants or purchasers to offset through reduced energy consumption. The study asks how subsidies or CO2 taxes could help correct these market anomalies. Market premiums vary greatly by geography, suggesting that subsidies or taxes would need to vary by region. The relative stability of construction and energy prices in 2019-2021 make this a useful study of how different factors can interact to influence market premiums and set parameters for social subsidy and tax interventions.

TI  - Exploring the Mechanisms Influencing Users' Willingness to Pay for Green Real Estate Projects in Asia Based on Technology Acceptance Modeling Theory
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - In contrast to the extensive research on the impact of green buildings on character, property values, energy efficiency, and environmental quality, less emphasis has been placed on understanding the factors driving users' selection of green real estate projects, an essential element for the future business sustainability of such buildings. This study investigates the connection between various user motivations, such as perceived usefulness, perceived usability, a sense of responsibility, awareness of consequences, and perceived behavioral control, and their impact on Asian users' willingness to pay for green real estate projects. These users include those who have already invested in and are considering long-term investment in such projects. An empirical methodology, integrating these motivations with a technology acceptance model, is proposed to assess their willingness to pay either through renting or buying. The study applies structural equation modeling to analyze sample data against a hypothetical model, thereby testing the hypotheses. It concludes that, in influencing green real estate projects, the following apply: (1) perceived usefulness and perceived behavioral control significantly shape Asian users' attitudes towards financial commitment; (2) perceived usability directly influences their perceived usefulness; (3) awareness of consequences acts as a mediating factor in the relationship between perceived usability and behavioral control among these users. Moreover, the study offers strategic design recommendations for future green real estate projects, informed by the diverse motivational factors of Asian users, to guide their purchasing and selection decisions.

TI  - Minimum energy efficiency standards in the commercial real estate sector: A critical review of policy regimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Given the significance of carbon emissions from the existing building stock, this paper aims to provide an in-ternational comparative analysis of pioneering policies on minimum energy efficiency standards in the Scottish, English/Welsh, Dutch and French commercial real estate sectors. These are the four national policy regimes to employ these policy instruments to date with varied timelines spanning from 2009 to 2050. The methodological approach employs a document review of policy texts produced by policy makers and other stakeholders. The four policy regimes are evaluated in terms of their policy design focussing on minimum performance standards, forward guidance, scope and exemptions. A key finding is that, given the range of intervening factors, side-effects and uncertainties, there are difficult choices in striking a balance between phasing implementation, providing forward guidance and adjusting policy in response to evaluation. Whilst it was initially expected that most European Union jurisdictions would default to an Energy Performance Certificate related standard, our findings show that there has been a shift towards standards that are linked to actual rather than modelled energy con-sumption. However, for leased stock where the owner may have limited operational control, the separation of owners' responsibility for compliance and the users' responsibility for operations makes designing consumption -based instruments more challenging. It is concluded that a central issue in policy design has been the trade-off between minimising the financial costs to property owners and occupiers of complying with performance thresholds and maximising reductions in energy consumption. There is growing recognition that regulatory economies of scale may be achieved by targeting large properties which allows for a large proportion of the total area of the stock to be covered whilst exempting a large proportion of transactions or properties.

TI  - Towards a just energy transition?: energy consumption and residential segregation in the metropolitan area of Barcelona
T2  - CIUDAD Y TERRITORIO-ESTUDIOS TERRITORIALES-CYTET
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores the relationship between social inequalities and the energy transition in the Barcelona metropolitan area. Thus, it analyzes to what extent the necessary process of improving energy efficiency and decarbonization can be associated not with a reduction but with an increase in inequalities. On the one hand, it is confirmed that the population with the lowest incomes resides in inefficient real estate parks and has a lower propensity than the average to take measures to improve the said situation. On the other hand, the more affluent areas have a greater propensity to implement self-generated electricity systems, as well as a greater presence of electric vehicles. The territorial concentration processes of both situations can come to consolidate social inequality and spatial segregation, which makes it necessary to adopt corrective policies.

TI  - Social housing in Spain: obsolescence and intervention strategies
T2  - VITRUVIO-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL TECHNOLOGY AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social housing in Spain has its origin in the first Cheap Houses Law that was promulgated in 1911, trying to provide a solution to a housing need for the working class who flocked to the cities in waves of migration from rural areas. Since then, legislative initiatives have been taking place to mitigate the housing problem. Each one of them was contributing elements that presumably contributed to the hygiene and habitability of the house without forgetting the economic conditions. At the moment, in Spain there is a large real estate park inherited from these initiatives. In many cases, these are neighborhoods that currently show notable energy and social vulnerability. Aware of the need to adapt these homes to the regulatory requirements related to energy efficiency, comfort and the physical and technical characteristics of the construction, the Research Centers are developing multiple investigations aimed at favoring the adaptability of homes and improving the quality of life of its inhabitants. This article takes a tour of the evolution that social housing has had during the 20th century in Spain and the current state of research aimed at adapting it to the new energy, habitability and sustainability requirements.

TI  - What Is the Impact of the Energy Class on Market Value Assessments of Residential Buildings? An Analysis throughout Northern Italy Based on Extensive Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regarding environmental sustainability and market pricing, the energy class is an increasingly more decisive characteristic in the real estate sector. For this reason, a great deal of attention is now devoted to exploring new technologies, energy consumption forecasting tools, intelligent platforms, site management devices, optimised procedures, software, and guidelines. New investments and smart possibilities are currently the object of different research in energy efficiency in building stocks to reach widespread ZEB standards as soon as possible. In this light, this work focuses on analysing 13 cities in Northern Italy to understand the impact of energy class on market values. An extensive data-mining process collects information about 13,093 properties in Lombardia, Piemonte, Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia-Giulia, Veneto, and Trentino alto Adige. Then, a feature importance analysis and a machine learning forecasting tool help understand the influence of energy class on market prices today.

TI  - Sustainability Messages in Residential Property Advertising
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Companies and brands are increasingly addressing issues of sustainability in their marketing and advertising as they respond to consumers' evolving interests and preferences. While studies have examined the presence of sustainability messages in advertising in general, and in a number of discrete industries, the use of these messages in residential property advertising is critically understudied. Some homebuyers, however, appear interested in these messages, as evidence suggests they ascribe value to certain sustainability claims and features. An analysis of the textual and visual content of 100 property adverts for city centre flats, listed for sale in two English cities in early 2022, afforded detailed insights into the positioning of sustainability in residential real estate advertising. Findings from this analysis indicate that explicit sustainability messages are rare. Property and locational features related to environmental sustainability are mentioned more frequently than those related to social sustainability. Features related to economic sustainability are discussed in adverts targeted at property investors. Sparse explicit discussion of sustainability in adverts might imply that there is little general concern for this issue, either amongst those selling property and/or amongst those buying property. An implication of this might be that pro-sustainability measures targeted at the housing sector may encounter a muted response from actors within the sector, potentially frustrating the implementation of those measures. For homebuyers who are interested in a property's sustainability, the findings suggest that they are poorly served by current practices in property advertising. Estate agents and developers wishing to appeal to these sustainability-minded consumers might do well to incorporate greater commentary on a property's sustainability features in their advertising materials.

TI  - Using Energy Policies to Shape Local Competitive Advantages
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess urban policies from the point of view of their impact on energy efficiency as a factor enhancing local competitiveness in Poland. To achieve this objective, we carried out an original study. The first step was to conduct a literature review. Next, an attempt was made to present the prevailing state of knowledge regarding the management of the competitiveness of cities and regions, as well as the functioning of energy efficiency in the economy. The development strategies of 18 selected cities serving as provincial capitals or playing other administrative roles at the regional level were also analysed. Importantly, the impact envisaged for municipal authorities to improve energy efficiency largely focuses on investments in the modernisation of public transport infrastructure and renewable energy sources. These investments certainly yield substantial cost savings, which are presented in the article. Nevertheless, it is essential to bear in mind that these are not the sole advantages of increased energy efficiency of local socio-economic systems. The investments also have the potential to enhance the perception of cities, increase the value of municipal real estate, and improve the health of urban residents by reducing emissions into the atmosphere. Still, a clearly discernible link between these arguments and a positive impact of cities' energy savings on their competitive standing and competitive edge is absent from the analysed city development strategies.

TI  - Quantifying the financial value of building decarbonization technology under uncertainty: Integrating energy modeling and investment analysis
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The built environment accounts for approximately 38% of global emissions. The evaluation of returns linked to investments in building decarbonization is impeded when confronted with uncertainties surrounding future energy prices, building emission regulations, and real estate market conditions. This paper develops an integrated framework that combines energy modeling with investment analysis to support the adoption of decarbonizing technologies under a context of uncertainty. The integrated framework includes projections of costs and benefits associated with the adoption of technology (i.e., changes in rental cashflows, vacancy rates, maintenance and energy costs) under a wide range of potential pathways of the energy markets and regulatory environment, and local real estate market demand for green buildings using Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, this paper develops the approach to investigate the potential value of flexibility in designing for building electrification (i. e., the ability to fully electrify gas heating systems at a later year). We illustrate the use of this approach in a case study of a new office building in New York City, faced with design choices between natural gas and electrified heating systems. We consider 10,000 scenarios changing future greenhouse emission penalties, investments in the local electric grid, local real estate market conditions and energy prices. In approximately 60 percent of simulations, the most profitable decision for the building owner is to adopt a natural gas-powered heating system. However, adopting a building design that provides a building the flexibility to fully electrify at a later date is more profitable than a natural gas-heating building in 96 percent of scenarios. A sensitivity analysis shows that the most influential parameter in the valuation of a design option is the size of the green premiums associated with improved energy efficiency.

T2  - ECONOMIC CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examines the relationship between natural resource growth, green economy growth, and energy intensity levels in achieving environmentally friendly economic growth in Asian countries. It analyzes the connections among the number of natural resources, institutional capacity, trade liberalization, and foreign direct investment in China from 2010 to 2022. The study concludes that economies flourish when countries utilize organic and synthetic energy sources, and natural resources can stimulate or impede economic development. A radical adjustment in real estate policies is required to address the growing urgency of reversing environmental degradation and combating climate change. Integration of renewable energy sources, optimization of natural resource usage, and the use of novel financial instruments and investment techniques emerge as pressing needs. The research focuses on whether eco-friendly company practices are associated with long-term economic success in Asian countries. It evaluates the impact of energy intensity on GDP growth and emphasizes the importance of a green economy in promoting sustainable economic growth. The study suggests governments should prioritize improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources, and supporting environmentally friendly industries for long-term prosperity. The paper highlights the need for Asian authorities to balance rapid economic progress with minimizing negative environmental and natural resource impacts.

TI  - Identifying Market Segment for the Assessment of a Price Premium for Green Certified Housing: A Cluster Analysis Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - While the literature confirms the existence of a green premium, various researchers have acknowledged the importance of homogeneity in the dataset used for premium assessment. This study developed a systematic approach to extract a sales subsample containing transactions from green-certified apartments and their most similar counterparts based on cluster analysis. The study applied k-means and PAM clustering algorithms to split an extensive sales sample of 81,605 transactions into sales subsamples. A sales subsample containing transactions from green-certified apartments and their peers was extracted and used for green premium estimation. The results indicate that through cluster analysis, a market segment containing above 80% of the total housing transactions from green-certified apartments could be identified. Through the hedonic model, a green premium of 26.2% was identified from the entire sales sample (no market segmentation). However, this value was reduced to 12.2 and 17.8% when estimated from a sales subsample extracted through k-means and PAM clustering, respectively. These findings have implications for the close assessment of green certification impact on the sale prices. In addition, they can also serve as an indicator of housing categories that need extra effort to promote green practices in that particular market segment.

TI  - Inefficient markets for energy efficiency? - The efficiency premium puzzle in the German rental housing market
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - On the market where prospective renters meet dwelling offers, competitive forces and rational behavior on both sides would imply that the monthly basic rent should reflect differences in expected monthly heating costs - other things being equal. We test this hypothesis by specifying a hedonic price model reflecting a total-cost-ofrenting perspective. Drawing on 844,229 apartment listings for rent from 2014 to 2020 on a small spatial scale, we find a premium for more energy-efficient apartments; however, it is rather small. If the energy performance score decreases by 10 kWh/m2a, the monthly basic rent increases, on average, by roughly euro0.01 per square meter living area. The expected energy cost savings thereby exceed the premium by a factor of three to seven. Rather, we find discounts of up to 9.2 % if apartments use heating technologies that are known to be inefficient. We explore various explanations for these outcomes, considering both landlord and renter behavior.

TI  - Quantification of the Improvement in Sustainability after a Comparative Experimental Study of Single-Family Homes with Façade Rehabilitation Using the External Thermal Insulation Composite System
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study emerged from the necessity to analyze the most effective energy-saving strategies within the current real estate market and substantiate their application with empirical data. Undoubtedly, the adoption of External Thermal Insulation Composite Systems (ETICSs) stands out as one of the prevalent approaches. This article presents temperature-monitoring data collected on-site from the facades of two single-family homes initially constructed with identical compositions, materials, construction dates, locations, and orientations. The thermal envelope of one home underwent rehabilitation using the ETICS, while the other remained in its original state. Continuous temperature recordings on the southern and northwestern facades of both homes were conducted using thermocouples over a 15-day period. The data analysis yielded insights into facade performance before and after this rehabilitation approach. The findings suggest that the implementation of ETICS results in more stable interior temperatures, significantly reducing indoor temperatures in comparison to outdoor conditions, leading to a notable decrease in heat energy loss. Consequently, this research underscores the tangible benefits of employing ETICS in building rehabilitation, emphasizing its role as a passive energy-saving strategy. By demonstrating the positive impact on thermal performance and energy efficiency, this study reinforces the vital connection between research endeavors and sustainability objectives.

TI  - Evaluation of the Design of Ecological Buildings Using the Matrix of Eco-Efficiency in Residential Sectors of Ecuador
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The research aims to study the influence of eco-efficient buildings by comparing their designs according to energy efficiency criteria and optimization considering scenarios with traditional construction systems. The proposed methodology shows that eco-efficient building projects comply with environmental and sustainable strategies for the expansion of height with floors. Previous technical characteristics and parameters are considered, and these are divided into three main areas: water, energy, and inputs, in addition to a secondary area: housing density. The evaluation that was carried out showed that the water consumption parameter is the most expensive to manage for any construction company and tends to be very irregular in its percentage of compliance, since it depends on the customs of the inhabitants. The energy parameter is considered a complex aspect, since the use of private transport is expected to decrease. However, due to the customs and structures of cities, this is difficult to change without comprehensive public policies. This implies that apartment sales decrease when there are no available parking spaces. On the other hand, the contribution parameter, regardless of the construction company, always remains constant due to the economic investment required and international regulations. Finally, the housing density is always met with the same percentage due to the amount of user occupancy in the buildings. The planning of the cities in Ecuador is currently part of a sustainable development, and the instruments and policies involved are shaped by the real estate sector and, with it, urban development. Thus, by starting from a definition of nature and going through a description of the regulations and public policies until specific cases in architecture are reached, the application of sustainable development in the real estate sector is shown.

TI  - Does Energy Star Certification Reduce Energy Use in Commercial Buildings?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of policies and programs are aimed at reducing energy use in buildings-building energy codes, disclosure laws, energy-use benchmarking, and mandated or subsidized energy audits. In the United States, many of these initiatives are enacted at the state or local level. At the federal level, one of the main programs is Energy Star certification, which provides a label to top energy-performing buildings. In this paper, we evaluate changes in rents and utility expenditures following Energy Star certification using a national sample of over 4,100 office buildings combined with Energy Star data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We find that building rents increase by 3.6% following certification, but that utility expenditures remain unchanged. We provide novel evidence that buildings do not make upgrades or capital investments to obtain a certification, suggesting that the Energy Star program primarily certifies buildings that are already energy efficient.

TI  - DESIGN OF A NET ZERO HOUSE AT 100-YEAR FLOOD ZONE IN A HISTORIC DISTRICT: A CASE OF SOLAR DECATHLON DESIGN CHALLENGE ENTRY
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses the design of a net-zero single-family house in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which was proposed for the 2022 Solar Decathlon Design Challenge entry. The site was in a 100-year flood zone and registered as a national and local historic district. The interdisciplinary team consisted of University of Tennessee Chattanooga (UTC) students from the interior architecture and engineering departments who embraced the challenges of the local climate and the restrictions of the historic district guidelines. This entry, Moc House, focused on the integration of passive design and active HVAC systems including photovoltaic systems in the process. In responding to recent housing market changes in Chattanooga due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a young professional couple in their 30s who have two children was identified as the target market which guided the space planning. Market analysis, including ROI, was conducted in addition to construction cost calculations. Building materials were selected to enhance the durability and resilience of the house structure. Finally, energy analysis was conducted to check the project's Home Energy Rating using Ekotrope and found it less than zero.

TI  - Assessing Office Building Marketability before and after the Implementation of Energy Benchmarking and Disclosure Policies-Lessons Learned from Major US Cities
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing number of U.S. cities require commercial/office properties to publicly disclose their energy performance due to the adoption of energy benchmarking and disclosure policies. This level of transparency provides an additional in-depth assessment of a building's performance beyond a sustainability certification (e.g., Energy Star, LEED) and may lead less energy-efficient buildings to invest in energy retrofits, therefore improving their marketability. However, the research is scarce on assessing the impact of such policies on office building marketability. This study tries to fill this gap by investigating the impact of energy benchmarking policies on the performance of office buildings in four major U.S. cities (New York; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; and Chicago). We use interrupted time series analysis (ITSA), while accounting for sustainability certification, public policy adoption, and property real estate performance. The results revealed that in some cities, energy-efficient buildings generally perform better than less energy-efficient buildings after the policy implementation, especially if they are Class A. The real estate performances of energy-efficient buildings also exhibited continuously increasing trends after the policy implementation. However, due to potentially confounding factors, further analysis is required to conclude the policy impacts on energy-efficient buildings are more positive than those on less energy-efficient buildings.

TI  - Retrofit Analysis of City-Scale Residential Buildings in the Hot Summer and Cold Winter Climate Zone
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising energy consumption in residential buildings within the hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) climate zone, driven by occupants' pursuit of improved thermal comfort, necessitates effective energy conservation measures. This study established urban building energy models for 32,145 residential buildings in Changsha City, China, and conducted a comprehensive retrofit analysis of seven energy conservation measures (ECMs). Additionally, the study assessed the impact of residents' conscious energy-saving behaviors concerning air conditioner (AC) control. The research commenced by creating six baseline models representative of the diverse building stock. Identifying seven commonly used ECMs, the study examined the potential of each measure for enhancing energy efficiency. To facilitate the analysis, a dedicated toolkit, AutoBPS-Retrofit, was developed to efficiently modify the baseline model for each ECM. Furthermore, the investigation delved into the investment cost of implementing the ECMs and evaluated their simple payback year (PBP) and net present value (NPV). The results demonstrate that tailored retrofit plans are essential when addressing envelope improvements, varying according to building types and ages. Retrofits targeting lighting systems offer both promising energy savings and favorable economic viability, albeit subject to residents' preferences. Alternatively, upgrading the AC systems emerges as the most energy-efficient approach, yet the economic assessment raises concerns. The study's findings offer practical insights for governments seeking to establish effective carbon reduction goals and policies. Moreover, the research can assist energy-saving institutions, real-estate companies, and stakeholders involved in renovation projects by offering guidance in making informed decisions to enhance energy efficiency in city-scale residential buildings.

TI  - Socio-Economic Barriers to Adopting Energy-Saving Bioclimatic Strategies in a Mediterranean Sustainable Real Estate Setting: A Quantitative Analysis of Resident Perspectives
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to escalating environmental challenges, this research underscores the pivotal role of sustainable construction practices, particularly focusing on bioclimatic design as a foundational element within the realm of sustainable architecture and environmental upgrading of buildings, within the broader context of sustainable urban planning. The study delves into the perspectives of residents in Cyprus concerning bioclimatic building design. Employing a quantitative methodology, the investigation aims to comprehensively assess homeowner views on the benefits, motivations, concerns, and preferred techniques associated with bioclimatic design. By comprehending these perspectives and contextual factors, this study identifies obstacles hindering broader implementation and illuminates why adoption remains limited, despite the potential for substantial energy and emissions reductions. The research also examines the background of respondents, such as heating/cooling systems, energy expenses, and upgrade preferences, to provide essential context for the findings. A structured questionnaire was administered to a stratified sample of 150 pedestrians in the Pafos area, ensuring a representative cross-section of the local population. This method allowed for a robust examination of demographic influences on opinions and an in-depth analysis of the impact of residential characteristics. The findings reveal a substantial influence of cost considerations in shaping decisions related to residential property development and the renovation of existing structures, contributing to the limitation of widespread adoption across the island. This influence persists even as a majority of respondents express a readiness to undertake building energy upgrades, among which, the most popular actions include the installation of specialized glass, the replacement of traditional air conditioning units with inverters, and the adoption of energy-efficient lighting. The research culminates in the proposal that introducing financial incentives has the potential to enhance homeowner participation in bioclimatic and energy upgrades. This recommendation is particularly salient in the climatic context of Cyprus, where the implementation of solar control measures emerges as a promising avenue for bolstering energy efficiency. In considering the socio-economic dimensions implicit in these findings, it becomes evident that the interplay between financial considerations and sustainable construction practices is a critical aspect. The identified barriers underscore the necessity for nuanced strategies and policy frameworks that address the socio-economic dimensions of bioclimatic design adoption. In this context, the study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by shedding light on the intricate relationship between financial factors and sustainable architectural practices, offering implications for future research endeavors and potential avenues for policy interventions.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthy, sustainable, energy-efficient buildings are more valuable since the green movement. Air quality, lighting, acoustics, and thermal conditions affect IEQ. Indoor air quality affects resident health. Chemicals or organisms contaminate the air. This work contributes to the goal of renovating and decarbonizing existing public administration buildings in the regional territory by integrating technologies and advanced building-plant systems management policies. This work focuses on building-plant energy diagnosis, its principles, regulations, and application procedures, especially IEQ and thermo-hygrometric comfort measurement and evaluation protocols. It follows a discussion of LCA for energy diagnosis and smart indoor air quality management and maintenance, such as quantifying human activity's impact on the indoor environment or adapting a modeling methodology to identify critical parameters to be monitored and controlled by building-plant systems' integrated sensor and actuator architecture. The goal is to find connections between indoor and outdoor air quality, occupant behavior in public buildings (especially schools and universities), and short-and long-term BRI. The study compares smart building diagnostic methods and procedures to European standards. This may improve Public Building Administration Social-LCA standards.

TI  - Are households willing to adopt solar home systems also likely to use electricity more efficiently? Empirical insights from Accra, Ghana
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The diffusion of renewable energy technology, such as solar home systems (SHS), has great potential to reduce GHG emissions. However, households' energy efficiency (EE) and curtailment behavior (CB) play a crucial role in this process. This study examines the rooftop solar PV potential, households' willingness to adopt SHS, and their EE/CB implications for mitigating CO2 emissions through SHS adoption. A survey of 216 households was carried out alongside rooftop solar PV potential analysis in a high-income gated estate and a middle-class neighborhood using secondary data. First, we find that rooftop solar PV has the potential to offset all grid electricity and its associated CO2 emissions for at least 63.5% of households. Secondly, the willingness to adopt SHS is lower in the high-income neighborhood than the middle-class ones. This dynamic is explained by the occupancy status, where most of those in the high-income neighborhood tend to be renters - a group known to have a low willingness to adopt SHS. Thirdly, our results affirm that energy-saving behavior is more common in a middle-class neighborhood where the propensity to adopt SHS is also high. Our results suggest that households willing to adopt SHS are more likely to engage in EE/CB. However, this tendency is common among middle-class households, who, in practice, may not be able to afford the SHS. Our findings underscore the need for more targeted policy interventions for SHS, and EE and CB among homeowners, high-income neighborhoods, and real estate developers.

TI  - <i>Libro del Edificio Electronico</i> (LdE-e): Advancing towards a Comprehensive Tool for the Management and Renovation of Multifamily Buildings in Spain
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2018, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) introduced Building Renovation Passports (BRP) to enable buildings to scale energy performance through a Scheduled Renovations Roadmap (SRR). The Digital Building Logbook (DBL) was introduced in 2021 as a repository of relevant building data to facilitate informed decision-making and information sharing among stakeholders. In Spain, both tools (DBL + SRR) have been studied separately in an incipient way. However, the interconnection of data in the tools come from the same document base. Evidence suggests that when building information is used in isolation, its value is diluted without stakeholder awareness. In this paper, we move towards unifying both tools (DBL+SRR) in a single comprehensive tool called the Libro del Edificio Electronico (LdE-e), with the aim of producing a single building database to drive multi-building renovations. For this purpose, the data fields of existing building information, assessment and management tools in Spain were studied in detail and reinterpreted in a new interconnected data structure. To evaluate the formulation of the LdE-e proposal, 11 semi-structured interviews were held with a panel of 13 experts specialized in real estate, building and energy efficiency. After these sessions, the LdE-e was reformulated, and the model was strengthened by analyzing vectors such as governance, management, usability, data flows, stakeholders and the impact of including new technologies such as BIM and blockchain. The results suggest that the LdE-e would improve control of the operation and maintenance of (new or existing) buildings, the programming of renovation actions based on deficits identified in technical inspections, and other aspects.

TI  - Efficiency and Sustainability: The Role of Digitization in Re-Inhabiting the Existing Building Stock
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are complex and constantly evolving systems where changing social needs have always reshaped the built environment. Considering recent evolutionary trends in housing emergencies, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, and environmental sustainability goals, a rethinking of the building heritage is fundamental. This article aims to promote the conversion of buildings designed initially for nonresidential uses as a process and project strategy based on energy efficiency and a holistic and integrated vision of the circular economy. The methodological approach is based on two main phases: definition of evaluative parameters for the potential reuse of a building, and integration of the evaluation system in a BIM and GIS environment. The result is a tool for rapid automatic pre-evaluation of the potential conversion of a building into a residential space. Applying the developed methodology allows for a practical approach to the significant issue of sustainable construction, with particular attention to energy improvement and the reduction of environmental impact related to the construction of new buildings. The originality of the contribution lies in the systematization of various digital technologies to provide fundamental support for managing and transforming the varied and widespread unused real estate assets in a state of abandonment and degradation.

TI  - A Parametric Approach for Optimizing Design Solutions in Urban Regeneration and Reshaping: An Application to a District Block in Bologna, Italy
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the deep renovation and enhancement of energy efficiency in existing urban areas, aiming to transform them into zero energy districts, utilizing renewable sources. This transformative process is essential to align with contemporary models for new buildings and to elevate existing structures to meet environmental housing standards mandated by current regulations. The proposed densification strategy is motivated by the necessity to augment the real estate value and enhance the architectural and performance quality of the existing building stock, all while minimizing additional land occupation. Its efficacy has been rigorously tested and demonstrated within the European Horizon 2020 project "ABRACADABRA". The key actions advocated for in this approach revolve around the incorporation of renewable energies, volumetric expansion, and completion volumes (urban infill), within the Positive Energy District. The validation of this process occurs on a district scale in a social housing urban block located in Bologna (Italy), with currently poor environmental performance. A multi-criteria analysis was employed to examine the architectural, climatic, and energy context. The meta-design phase successfully attained the energy and economic targets set by the project and by local and European regulations settings, offering an optimized design solutions for reshaping the built environment.

TI  - Adaptive reuse of heritage buildings; a systematic literature review of success factors
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Whilst adaptive reuse is often applied with good outcomes, we are also faced with projects that have not achieved the desired results. There is little insight into why some projects succeed and others fail, or even what constitutes "success" at all - due in part to the intangibility of the word "success" and unsettled definitions and synonyms of "adaptive reuse. Accordingly, this paper seeks to answer the question: What are the factors that can be used to assess the success of heritage adaptive reuse projects? This study is framed as a systematic literature review of relevant articles published or in press. The methodology is based on using a PRISMA diagram to address a number of papers that are screened in each step of the diagram: identification, screening, eligibility and included. The literature review process started with 731 in the first step and ends with the final results of 72 papers. The results are classified into ten categories of success factors: architectural, structural, socio-cultural, economic, environmental, energy, authenticity, legal, management and functional factors. Together, these provide a comprehensive understanding of factors that affect the success of adaptive reuse as a strategy to regenerate heritage buildings. This insight facilitates adaptive reuse strategies for designers, architects and real estate developers.

TI  - The Green Premium: Environmental Regulation, Environmental Risk and Property Value
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper estimates the effect of the closure and relocation of chemical enterprises along the Yangtze River on housing prices in China. With a difference-in-differences (DiD) model and detailed data on polluting enterprises, house transactions, and environmental complaints, we find that environmental regulation led to a 1.7% increase in housing prices and a 43.3% reduction in perceived environmental risks, as measured by environmental complaints from surrounding residents. In addition, we observe a greater change in property values among taller buildings than among shorter buildings. This paper elucidates how developing countries can benefit from environmental regulation by influencing residents' risk perceptions.

TI  - Financial inclusion and low-carbon architectural design strategies: solutions for architectural climate conditions and architectural temperature on new buildings
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research is to explore the potential of financial inclusion and low-carbon architectural design strategies as solutions to improve the thermal comfort and energy efficiency of new buildings in different architectural climate conditions. The manufacture sector, which accounts for about 40% of all yearly greenhouse gas releases, has been stimulating with trying to reduce the amount of energy it consumes and the detrimental effects it has on the climate, in accordance with the standards outlined in the 2016 Paris Agreement. In this study, panel data analysis is used to examine the connection between green property financing and carbon dioxide emissions from the building sector in one hundred and five developed and developing countries. Although this analysis finds a negative correlation among the development of environmentally friendly real estate financing and firms' worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, it finds that this correlation is most robust in developing nations. A number of these countries are experiencing an unregulated and rapid population explosion, which has boosted their demand for oil, making this discovery essential for them. The difficulty in securing green funding during this crisis is slowing and even reversing gains made in past years, making it all the more important to keep this momentum going during the COVID-19 outbreak. It's critical to keep the momentum going by doing something.

AB  - According to Data Bridge Market Research, tiny houses are nowadays being implemented more often as it relates to the global tiny house market. The tiny-house trend, evolving expenses for living due to rising prices, as well as the increasing demand for inexpensive alternatives to housing, are all predicted to stimulate the growing popularity of the worldwide tiny housing market. Among the countries included in the analysis on the global tiny house market is Egypt, which demonstrates a significant rise in demand for projects that include these tiny housing from 2022 to 2029. The moment has arrived for humanity to actively react to decrease the pressure that the rising population is placing on the planet's natural resources and shift to an ecologically sustainable lifestyle by identifying housing needs and how people choose to live. Tiny housing has grown so popular recently that many individuals all around the world are now being encouraged to downsize and live simple with only the essentials, specifically their living footprint. This could be extremely developed utilizing sustainable materials that are energy efficient, acting as an insulation factor, offering an optimum thermal comfort, allowing for a very minimal expense, revealing it to be a cost-effective solution and enhancing the beneficial impact on the environment.The aim of this paper is to outline the changeover from an unsustainable, unfriendly environment to one that is highly sustainable and efficient, maintainable, and economical through applying energy efficient thermal insulation materials achieving thermal comfort. The concept Tiny Housing, its aspects, and principles related to design, sustainability, and energy efficiency will be covered in this research, which will also conduct a qualitative literature review concluding design principles and parameters to be applied into any design stage. Furthermore, it will focus on environmentally friendly building materials gathered from various research papers as well as RIBA projects, acting as an insulation factor that will be illustrated through a framework tabular design. Using a simulation tool named "Ecotect," different thermal insulation materials will be examined and tested on a 40 square meter tiny house, especially wall insulation, to determine which material has the highest energy efficiency to be applied on a tiny house to reduce energy consumptions. It thus leads to the conclusion that there isn't one appropriate answer with regard to insulation materials since there are numerous up to date, innovative eco-friendly materials available today. However, this paper will assist in determining and narrowing down to the most efficient thermal insulative material among the ones selected, so that it can be suggested as a functional, cost-effective and energy-saving solution.

TI  - Modeling eco-friendly house purchasing intention: a combined study of PLS-SEM and fsQCA approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeThe urgency to address climate change and its devastating consequences has never been more pressing. As societies become increasingly aware of the detrimental impact of traditional housing on the planet, there is a growing demand for eco-friendly housing solutions that prioritize energy efficiency, resource conservation and reduced carbon emissions. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the factors that influence customers' priority toward eco-friendly house purchasing intention. Design/methodology/approachThis study collected 386 data using a quantitative research strategy and purposive sampling method. This study uses a hybrid analysis technique using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approaches to identify the influencing factors. FindingsThe PLS-SEM analysis found that attitude toward the eco-friendly house, subjective norms, performance expectancy, environmental knowledge and environmental sensitivity have a positive influence on eco-friendly house purchasing intention. However, perceived behavioral control and willingness to pay were found to have insignificant effect on customers' intention to purchase eco-friendly houses. The fsQCA results further revealed complex causal relationships between the influencing factors. Practical implicationsThis research will not only contribute to academic knowledge but also provide practical guidance to real estate developers, policymakers and individuals looking to make environmentally responsible choices. By understanding the factors that influence consumers' intentions to purchase eco-friendly houses, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient future. Originality/valueThis study has used a hybrid analysis technique, combining PLS-SEM and fsQCA, to enhance the predictive accuracy of eco-friendly house purchase intentions among individuals residing in densely populated and highly polluted developing countries, such as Bangladesh.

TI  - Roadmap to a Sustainable Energy System: Is Uncertainty a Major Barrier to Investments for Building Energy Retrofit Projects in Wide City Compartments?
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the roadmap to a Sustainable Real Estate-Scape, energy retrofit campaigns on wide city compartments represent a pivotal task, where the importance of the collaboration between the public and private sectors is crucial. Energy retrofit programs on building assets are subject to multiple uncertainty factors (e.g., climate, energy-economy forecasts, etc.) that act as a primary barrier to investment in this field. This paper aims to discuss risk management techniques to understand better how to deal with this kind of uncertainty. The research specifically addresses the techniques of sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, focusing first on the phase of variables selection and their probability definition, including climatic, environmental, energy, economic, financial, and stochastic parameters. In this article, it is suggested to include correlation coefficients in the input variables of risk analysis, preferring the two-dimension Monte Carlo simulation to its simple version, since the results are more reliable when separating aleatory from epistemic uncertainty; thus, the results are more reliable. Moreover, it is seen how a sensitivity analysis based on percentile variations of the inputs provides a more accurate representation of risk if compared to the most common sensitivity analysis based on percentage deviations of the inputs. Conducting a sensitivity analysis using percentile variations gives realistic and reliable results, reflecting the tailored definition of uncertainty around the inputs on the basis of specific market analyses or historical series.

TI  - A Tripartite Evolutionary Game on Promoting the Development of Nearly-Zero Energy Consumption Buildings in China
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly zero-energy-consumption buildings are the inevitable trend of future buildings. There have been a large number of studies on nearly zero building technology issues. However, there is no detailed study on how to effectively promote the development of nearly zero-energy consumption buildings according to China's national conditions. Here, by establishing an evolutionary game model, this paper discusses the dynamic game scheme selection and stability strategy of three stakeholders, namely local government, real estate companies, and construction consumers, related to the development of nearly zero-energy-consumption buildings in the development process. The conditions required for evolutionary stabilization strategies were identified. Finally, Matlab data simulation analysis is used to further illustrate the stability and equilibrium strategies of each subject and the sensitivity analysis of the main influencing factors at various stages in the development process of nearly zero-energy-consuming buildings. The research results show that the government plays a leading role in the early stage of the development of nearly zero-energy consumption buildings, and as the market matures, government intervention gradually withdraws from the market; furthermore, if the cost of supervision is prohibitively high, the government's willingness to supervise the market will be reduced. This will hinder consumers and developers from choosing nearly zero-energy-consuming buildings and if the penalties and subsidies are too low, it will be meaningless to the evolution of the optimal solution of the three parties. On this basis, targeted promotion programs are established to realize the rapid development of China's nearly zero-energy-consumption building sector. Our research results can provide important scientific basis for the development of the nearly zero-energy building industry in China.

TI  - Real Estate Portfolio Carbon Risk Score (CaRiS)
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - Decarbonising the built environment is being highlighted at COP27 as fundamental to make progress towards mitigating the impacts of the climate crisis and enabling zero carbon pathways for society. A range of third-party voluntary commitments enabling transparency are on offer and an array of carbon calculators, tools and processes help somewhat in guiding and in decision making. Rightly so much attention has focused on construction professionals and their role in decision making to decarbonise new build and, to a lesser extent, refurbishment.  For a portfolio of residential buildings there is a lack of visibility, or awareness, of the operational carbon load and the embodied carbon an investor is taking on. This conceals risks, but also obscures opportunities. Financial services organisations need to better understand the relative contributions that operational and embodied carbon make on the climate and environmental risk associated with assets (and the impact that lifecycle considerations and building improvement interventions have). However, there is currently no consistent methodology to do this.  CaRiS is a methodology and proof-of-concept tool that brings visibility to embodied and operational carbon associated with a residential portfolio, enabling the financial sector to effectively risk manage and make better decisions in managing portfolios in future. Our Phase 1 project built a proof-of-concept tool which is the starting point for this project. We will work with stakeholders from the financial services sector to deliver the functionality and user interface required. The user insight we gather will direct the build of the technical models, develop and test the iterations of the CaRiS tool drawing upon existing data sets. A circular economy approach will be explored to quantify potential for an 'embodied carbon credit' to enable clients to manage their built assets as valuable materials banks (rather than embodied carbon liabilities). For operational carbon we continue to look beyond EPC for data sources and approaches that can be harvested to provide a consistent measure. Interventions (e.g., renewables, heat, fabric) to improve the assets operational carbon performance will be presented alongside embodied carbon incurred. The two strands combine as a carbon position and pathway for the asset (aggregated into the portfolio) enabling a carbon risk score concept. The risk score considers this carbon position alongside any limitations for improvement, the remaining design life, the need for deeper refurbishment and benchmarks against national performance targets and entity databases.

TI  - FuSe-TG: The Future of Semiconductor Technologies for Computing through Device-Architecture-Application Co-Design
M3  - Awarded Grant
AB  - A 2020 issue of Massachusetts Institute of Technology���s Tech Review read ���[Moore���s law] has fueled prosperity of the last 50 years. But the end is now in sight.��� However, this latter conclusion can be debated. Historically, exponential growth in semiconductors was achieved through two-dimensional (2D) miniaturization of devices (transistors, memory, and wires) to pack more components in the same chip area and achieve lower cost per function. Indeed, we are now reaching the physical limits of this 2D scaling paradigm. However, alternative approaches will trigger a seismic shift to reinvigorate the US semiconductor economy. This project will explore, identify, and map out the possible paths that lie ahead through partnerships among universities and industry/industrial research leaders in semiconductors, through educational efforts to translate new knowledge into the educational pipeline and semiconductor workforce, and through piloting new collaboration methods to enable lab-to-fab translation more readily with robust inputs from industry experts. This teaming grant will thus break new grounds for the future of semiconductors for domain-specific computing. The longer-term goal is to create national impact on research, education, and commercialization by encouraging students to follow a career path in semiconductors near national fab facilities. This is planned through multiple catalysts, e.g., a pilot program for lab and fab experiences for community college students, co-design challenges etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past two decades, it has become increasingly untenable to create architectures and device technologies independent of one another because there are intertwined dependencies across the abstraction boundaries. In addition, because of the extreme energy efficiency demands of future systems, architectures and device technologies must be driven by the specific application domains at hand. Thus, the focus of this project is device-architecture-application co-design. Building in the third dimension (3D, like a high-rise), with ultra-dense vertical connectivity between 3D layers, could significantly increase the number of devices packed on a piece of chip real estate in a scalable manner for significant benefits in energy and throughput, as, e.g., used by the Stanford Nano-Engineered Computing Systems Technology (N3XT) 3D approach. Multiple N3XT 3D chips are to be integrated through a continuum of chip stacking-/interposer-/wafer-level assembly/ integration. The foundation for this teaming activities will be the MOnolithic Stacked, Assembled IC (MOSAIC) N3XT 3D concept. Rather than relying solely on silicon-based transistors to perform all desired functions, heterogeneous materials and customized device structures optimally designed to perform diverse/distinct functions, i.e., domain-specific device technologies, will be used. The project will explore new domain-specific architectures (e.g., targeting AI deep neural nets, augmented reality/virtual reality, and graph analytics) uniquely enabled by the technology concepts, new Electronic Design Automation tools, and new open-source frameworks for device-architecture-application co-design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.

M3  - Data set
AB  - Abstract copyright UK Data Service and data collection copyright owner.The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) has statutory responsibility in relation to regularly examining housing conditions and need and this provides the basis for the Housing Executive to undertake House Condition Surveys. The Northern Ireland House Condition Survey (NIHCS) provides a wealth of information, which is readily available to, and is regularly requested by government departments, government agencies, the voluntary sector, charities, universities and many private sector interests.The surveys have been carried out since 1974, but the UK Data Archive only holds data from the tenth survey (2009) onwards. All tenures and types of housing are included in the NIHCS, for example, owner occupied and rented housing, vacant dwellings, houses in multiple occupation, apartments, urban and rural properties. For further background information, see study documentation. Further information about the survey can be found on the NIHE House Condition Survey webpage. The 2016 NIHCS was the twelfth survey to be carried out in Northern Ireland since 1974. All tenures and types of housing were included, for example, owner-occupied and rented housing, vacant dwellings, houses in multiple occupation, apartments, and urban and rural properties. The UK Data Service holds a subset of key housing stock and interview data variables (plus associated derived variables) for all cases (2,023) and for cases where a full household interview has been completed (1,917). Data for vacant stock is also included. The 2016 dataset provided includes one weight for both the housing stock data and household data. This dataset should be used for any analysis of the housing stock and household data. An interview is conducted with the household reference person or partner (if applicable). Please note that generally, the sample data will permit two-way cross-tabulations. However, care needs to be taken with small numbers, especially if variables have many categories. Three-way cross-tabulations or more will not be robust enough to be meaningful. It is important to note that users should use weighted data only for reporting, and numbers should be rounded to the nearest 100 if quoting. National Statistics AssessmentThe 2016 House Condition Survey was assessed for and awarded National Statistic status. House Condition Surveys published prior to 2016 are not classed as National Statistics. National Statistics status means that official statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value and comply with all aspects of the Code of Practice for Statistics. Conduct of the Survey The 2016 NIHCS used electronic tablet devices to collect the data. This approach was first used in 2009 and was reviewed and enhanced for the 2011 and 2016 surveys. The bespoke software used was developed by the Building Research Establishment (BRE). Validation and consistency checks were built into the programme, and once a survey was completed, it was uploaded and locked into a database via a secure website. The hardware had secure user identification and device-level security. The electronic approach, project management, design, administration, quality assurance analysis, and report writing were the responsibilities of the Housing Executives Research Unit. A total of 19 professional surveyors were employed to work on the 2016 House Condition Survey; all of whom worked on the 2006, 2009 and/or 2011 surveys. Surveyors employed were Environmental Health Officers, chartered surveyors or architects. Five experienced supervisors were responsible for advising surveyors and ensuring their work was of a consistent and satisfactory quality. All surveyors and supervisors attended a two-and-a-half-day training session before the fieldwork commenced. ReportsThe 2016 Northern Ireland House Condition Survey Report(available on the NIHE NIHCS webpage and in the study documentation) provides a comprehensive overview of Northern Irelands dwelling stock and its occupants in 2016 in a readily digestible format. The report concentrates on issues and developments that are of particular importance in understanding the Northern Ireland housing market.The statistical annex includes a range of tables containing information to support the description and analysis contained in the report and to provide a comprehensive reference for those requiring further details. Appendices contain information on the sampling, survey form, technical information on repair costs, the fuel poverty models, decent homes, the housing health and safety rating system, and SAP models (including the energy efficiency rating - EER). A summary report is also available on the NIHE NIHCS webpage.Latest edition informationFor the third edition (December 2023), the energy consumption variables derived from the main dataset through a modelling stream of works were added to the data file. The new variables are: total_nrg, nrg_sp_w, nrg_la, nrg_cookin, total_co2, co2_space, co2_water, co2_sp_w, co2_l_a, co2_cookin, co2_renewa, totEnergyTJ, spWEnergyTJc, totCO2kT and spWCO2kT. Main Topics: The information gathered in the physical section allows measurement of repair costs, The Decent Homes Standard, fuel poverty, SAP, HHSRS and the Fitness Standard. The archived dataset contains fuel poverty variables for both the 10% definition and Low Income High Cost definition. Care needs to be taken when identifying variables for the two different definitions. Further information on both fuel poverty definitions can be found in Appendix E of the main 2016 HCS report. Information from the social survey can be cross referenced with the physical survey data to provide an indication of the types of households living in dwellings which are in the poorest condition and most likely to fail government standards.The E-Survey FormThe E-Survey form comprised five main sections of questions covering:The physical attributes of each dwelling (internal and external);The physical aspects of flats and common areas;Demographic, social economic and attitudinal information on households;The front and back plot of the dwelling; the local neighbourhood and area;The Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS).The main areas of change between the 2011 and 2016 survey forms were the inclusion of a number of new energy items for surveyors to record and a number of social questions (including income and benefits) were harmonised with the Primary Principles as set out by the Office for National Statistics. © Crown copyright.
