TI  - Does Energy Star Certification Reduce Energy Use in Commercial Buildings?
AU  - Brolinson, B

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
AB  - A number of policies and programs are aimed at reducing energy use in buildings-building energy codes, disclosure laws, energy-use benchmarking, and mandated or subsidized energy audits. In the United States, many of these initiatives are enacted at the state or local level. At the federal level, one of the main programs is Energy Star certification, which provides a label to top energy-performing buildings. In this paper, we evaluate changes in rents and utility expenditures following Energy Star certification using a national sample of over 4,100 office buildings combined with Energy Star data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We find that building rents increase by 3.6% following certification, but that utility expenditures remain unchanged. We provide novel evidence that buildings do not make upgrades or capital investments to obtain a certification, suggesting that the Energy Star program primarily certifies buildings that are already energy efficient.

TI  - Sustainability Messages in Residential Property Advertising
AU  - Brookfield, K

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Companies and brands are increasingly addressing issues of sustainability in their marketing and advertising as they respond to consumers' evolving interests and preferences. While studies have examined the presence of sustainability messages in advertising in general, and in a number of discrete industries, the use of these messages in residential property advertising is critically understudied. Some homebuyers, however, appear interested in these messages, as evidence suggests they ascribe value to certain sustainability claims and features. An analysis of the textual and visual content of 100 property adverts for city centre flats, listed for sale in two English cities in early 2022, afforded detailed insights into the positioning of sustainability in residential real estate advertising. Findings from this analysis indicate that explicit sustainability messages are rare. Property and locational features related to environmental sustainability are mentioned more frequently than those related to social sustainability. Features related to economic sustainability are discussed in adverts targeted at property investors. Sparse explicit discussion of sustainability in adverts might imply that there is little general concern for this issue, either amongst those selling property and/or amongst those buying property. An implication of this might be that pro-sustainability measures targeted at the housing sector may encounter a muted response from actors within the sector, potentially frustrating the implementation of those measures. For homebuyers who are interested in a property's sustainability, the findings suggest that they are poorly served by current practices in property advertising. Estate agents and developers wishing to appeal to these sustainability-minded consumers might do well to incorporate greater commentary on a property's sustainability features in their advertising materials.

AU  - Aksoy, E

T2  - ICONARP INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING
AB  - Due to the rapid growth and development caused mainly by tourism of Alanya, rural areas are affected, losing their original texture and authentic structures and being exposed to unqualified interventions. The aim of this study is to determine the original features and reveal the value of Alanya rural architecture within the framework of the sustainability principles, and to determine how these values have changed with the unqualified interventions, by detailing qualitatively and quantitatively on the basis of each intervention. Within the scope of the study, the rural architectural heritage in Alanya has been documented in terms of settlement texture, space organization, architectural elements, material, construction and energy efficiency. For the analysis, a rural house that preserves its original values was used. A comparison was made between the values of this house and the values obtained as a result of the changes in the other buildings in the area. In cases where these interventions are applied in various variations, the changes in the heating and cooling load of the house are compared with the CO2 emission. It has been determined that the rural houses of Alanya provide energy conservation in a way that is perfected by tradition, both in terms of settlement features and space and materials on the basis of structure. It has been determined that the heating/cooling energy requirement can decrease but the CO2 emission increases in the individual changes made by evaluating different types of deterioration. When the most common application variations detected in the field are evaluated, it has been determined that both the heating/cooling energy requirement and the CO2 emission have increased. Rural settlements and residences define an architecture that has reached the highest level in terms of convenience, functionality and economy. Since any intervention to these structures means the loss of their energy conservation properties as well as their originality, a very careful decision should be made. The study reveals the first data in which the rural architecture of Alanya is evaluated within the scope of sustainability and energy and CO2 emissions are compared depending on deterioration/changes.

TI  - Assessing evidence for inattention to the costs of homeownership
AU  - Bengali, L
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS
AB  - Many goods and services have accompanying costs that are not salient at the moment of purchase. Existing research suggests that consumers are inattentive to such costs when making small purchases. There is less evidence about attention to costs associated with large purchases. This paper examines residential real estate transactions and studies the extent to which sale prices adjust to ownership costs. The results are inconclusive, neither ruling out full price adjustment nor lack of price adjustment. Despite the inconclusive result, the inability to decisively rule out incomplete price adjustment to predictable ownership costs (which is suggestive of inattention) is noteworthy, given the high financial stakes of buying a home.

TI  - Cold homes and mental health harm: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study
AU  - Clair, A
AU  - Baker, E
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Cold homes are associated with a range of serious health conditions as well as excess winter mortality. Despite a comparatively mild climate cold homes are a significant problem in the UK, with a recent estimate finding that over one-quarter of low-income households had been unable to adequately heat their home in winter 2022. The magnitude of cold housing in a country that benefits from a mild climate indicates indifference towards, or acceptance of, a significant minority of people living in inadequate conditions on the part of policy makers. Cold homes are therefore a source of social harm. Recent changes to the household energy price cap, the rising cost of living, the ongoing effects of the benefit cap, and below inflation uprating to social security benefits is likely to greatly exacerbate this issue. In this research we use data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study to explore whether living in a cold home causes mental health harm. We control for mental distress and housing temper-ature on entry to the survey in order to account for the potentially bi-directional relationship. Multilevel discrete -time event history models show that the transition into living in a home that is not suitably warm is associated with nearly double the odds of experiencing severe mental distress for those who had no mental distress at the beginning of the survey; and over three times the odds of severe mental distress for those previously on the borderline of severe mental distress. These results show the significant costs of failing to ensure that people are able to live in homes in which they are able to live comfortably by even the most basic standards. These costs will be felt not just individually, but also more broadly in terms of increased health spending and reduced working.

AB  - The financing of energy efficiency measures and renovations is key to reaching energy efficiency targets for the housing sector. The purpose of this article is to add the Swedish case of how capital market funds have become accessible and used by public and private housing companies, in particular for energy efficiency measures. The core of this article are interviews with representatives of Swedish housing companies made during the spring of 2021 with the purpose of mapping how public and larger private housing companies finance renovation and energy efficiency measures, and to what extent funds from the capital market are used for these purposes. In this article, we have found that capital market funds are commonly used by the Swedish public and the largest private housing companies. Bonds are less costly compared to bank loans, and green bonds are 0.02-0.03 percentage points less costly than conventional bonds. Furthermore, control systems that investigate the values of building portfolios as security for bonds are poor. A conclusion is that governmental control systems over the capital market issuing bonds for the housing market could be needed to avert future housing bubbles.

AU  - Lundmark, R
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - This study empirically estimated disaggregate market transaction costs facing single-family house-owners when energy renovating their dwelling. Two types of energy renovations are analysed: heat insulation and energy -saving windows. An analytical framework was developed including an adjustment mechanism for time-biases displayed by households. The decision process was modelling in three steps where households can be either latent, potential or actual clients to an energy renovation project. Data was collected by web-based surveys. The transaction costs are estimated based on time assessment, income levels and monetary expenditures occurring in the decision process. The results suggest that the magnitude of the transaction costs can be an important barrier to energy renovations. For energy-saving windows, transaction costs can constitute more than 50% of the in-vestment cost, and almost 24% for heat insulation. The largest potential reduction in the transaction costs is found in the implementation phase.

T2  - FRONTIERS OF ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - A courtyard is an architectural design element which is often known as microcli-mate modifiers and is responsible to increase the indoor occupant comfort in traditional archi-tecture. The aim of this study is to conduct a parametric evaluation of courtyard design variants in a residential building of different climates with a focus on indoor thermal comfort and utility costs. A brute-force approach is applied to generate a wide range of design alter-natives and the simulation workflow is conducted by Grasshopper together with the environ-mental plugins Ladybug and Honeybee. The main study objective is the evaluation of the occupant thermal comfort in an air-conditioned residential building, energy load, and cost analysis, derived from different design variables including courtyard geometry, window-to -wall ratio, envelope materials, heating, and cooling set-point dead-bands, and building geographical location. Furthermore, a Deep Learning model is developed using the inputs and outputs of the simulation and analysis to transform the outcomes into the algorithmic and tangible environment feasible for predictive applications. The results suggest that regarding the thermal loads, costs, and indoor thermal comfort index (PMV), there are high correlations between the outdoor weather variation and dead-band ranges, while in extreme climates such as Singapore, courtyard spaces might not be efficient enough as expected. Finally, the highly accurate deep learning model is also developed, delivering superior predic-tive capabilities for the thermal comfort and utility costs of the courtyard designs.(c) 2022 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

T2  - PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight the regulatory barriers to achieving sustainable buildings in Kosovo. The present paper focuses on regulatory barriers viewed from the perspective of construction industry experts in achieving sustainable buildings. Design/methodology/approach The present study uses a qualitative research method and semi-structured interviews as a research instrument. The present study interviews around 20 experts in construction and property management, property development, spatial planning and energy management. Findings The study finds that Kosovo building laws and regulations provide for the materials assessment criteria, but the materials assessment criteria are only for mechanic strength. The study further finds that the sustainability concept is not included and incorporated in Kosovo's urban planning laws and regulations. The study also finds that despite specific clauses mentioning energy performance certificates in the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings in Kosovo, energy performance certificates appears to be not enforced and the nature of the barrier is more organizational rather than regulatory. Finally, the study finds that Kosovo laws are silent as far as green labeling of building materials is concerned. Practical implications The implication of the present finding is that policymakers in Kosovo not only should include clear sustainable materials assessment criteria in the law, but also enforce those criteria through testing and inspection mechanisms included in the law and implemented in practice through funding and organizational support. Nonetheless, policymakers in Kosovo should contemplate amending the urban planning laws in Kosovo and include both the term of sustainability at the planning level and conformity guidelines for sustainable design that can be done at the administrative directive level. Further, the clauses in the law do not suffice if the clauses are not accompanied by specific systemic and organizational support in the issuance of energy performance certificates. Policymakers in Kosovo should be proactive in designing clauses that specify green labeling standards for materials; however, these labeling standards should not adversely affect the cost of construction and reduce the demand for real estate. Originality/value The study is the first qualitative study about the perception of construction professionals in Kosovo, regarding the regulatory barriers of sustainable buildings in Kosovo.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the performance efficiency of 56 real estate assets within the rental sector in the UAE to evaluate the relative operation efficiency in relation to revenue generation. Design/methodology/approach The data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach was used to measure the relative operational efficiency of the studied assets in relation to the revenue performance. This method could produce a more informed and balanced approach to performance measurement. Findings The outcomes show that scores of efficiencies ranging from 7% to 99% in some of the models. The results showed that on average buildings are 75% relatively less efficient in maintenance, in term of revenue generation, than the benchmark set. Likewise, on average, the inefficient buildings are 60% relatively less efficient in insurance. Result also shows that 95% of the building assets in the sample are by and large operating at decreasing returns to scale. This implies that managers need to considerably reduce the operational resources (input) to improve the levels of revenue. Research limitations/implications This study recommends that the FM operational variables that were found to inefficiently contribute to the revenue should be re-examined to test the validity of the findings. This is necessary before generalising or interpolating the results that are presented in this study. Practical implications The information obtained about operational performance can help FM managers to understand which improvements in the productivity of inefficient FM resources are required, providing insight into how to reduce operating costs and increase revenue. Originality/value This paper adds value in using new FM operational parameters to evaluate the efficiency of the performance of built assets.

T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Many energy-efficiency programs at the national and EU levels target the residential building sector. Investment in the renovation of buildings results in increased energy efficiency and can minimise energy utilisation when up-to-date technique and accurate planning is performed. The realisation depends on many subjects. One critical objective in the planning process is the financial status of the families living in the building stock subject of the renovation projects. A complex approach is essential in housing renovation programs, and the consequences of different energy policies in each country should be considered. This study reports the possible level of Hungarian prebound and its consequence on the energy efficiency mortgage loans. The heating expenditure varies by household's income situation and/or the dwelling's technical characteristics. A mixed picture was found, reducing available expenditure and, typically, higher monthly savings rates for smaller dwellings. We found that the prebound and rebound effects and credit constraints might limit a nationwide energy renovation program. Furthermore, the fixed residential energy price policy can impair the effectiveness of housing renovation pro-grams. We found a minimal positive effect on banks' expected credit loss and the regulatory capital requirement on home energy-efficiency improvements.

Using data from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF), it examines the relationship between performance for funds in the Open Ended Diversified Core Equity (ODCE) Index and reporting to the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), a platform for disclosure about fund/firm-level ESG strategies and performance. The empirical analyses suggest four conclusions. First, there has been substantial adoption of and reporting to GRESB in the last 5 years, suggesting that reporting to GRESB is a form of table stakes for ODCE members. Second, GRESB participation and performance are both significant predictors of cross-sectional fund returns. Third, GRESB participation and performance are associated with the price appreciation component of fund total returns but not with the income component. Fourth, the relationships between fund returns and GRESB participation and scores are independent of local economic conditions. These results close an important gap in the literature about private equity real estate fund performance and ESG/climate change mitigation efforts in commercial real estate markets.

AB  - Ensuring adequate implementation of solar energy for providing environment-friendly energy to the household sector, which can considerably abate pollutants in the environment and make power industry structure sustainable, is necessary for developing countries. Comparison in terms of environmental and cost impacts of renewable energy (hybrid solar system) with non-renewable energy sources, water and planning development authority (WAPDA), and diesel generators (DGs) has been examined in the household sector of Pakistan. Primary data of hybrid solar systems have been obtained from 10 different households segregated them into two categories according to their income as medium-income households (MIHs) and lower income households (LIHs) containing 5 kW and 3 kW of hybrid solar energy systems, respectively. While operating with a hybrid solar energy system instead of a non-renewable energy system, in terms of average generated power and average running load, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can be reduced up to 8,446.6 kg CO2 and 6,131.725 kg CO2, respectively, in the next 25 years. Comparison of costs indicated that renewable energy has a comparatively low cost per electric unit. It can pay back its total installation cost in just 8 years and can save a sum of $4,936.4375, along with many more ecological, economic, and societal benefits. Pakistan can efficiently utilize solar energy to relegate CO2 emissions and general costs as it has distinct geographical features to access sunlight in most days of the year.

AU  - Kim, DH
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - Building sustainability has become a major objective in architecture due to buildings' significant contribution to the environment degradation. Like many other nations, South Korea has inaugurated the Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design (G-SEED) to address the issue of environmental loads caused by energy inefficient buildings. Due to the additional construction cost needed to obtain G-SEED certification, building stakeholders face challenges in deciding whether to invest in green building certification. In this study, we evaluate the existence and magnitude of the G-SEED price premium in Seoul, one of most densely populated cities in South Korea. We applied the hedonic pricing model to an extensive dataset of all housing transactions made during 2018 in all 25 districts of Seoul. Our findings indicate that the average price premium for a G-SEED certified apartment is 24.3%, with the premium being 18.3%, 31.0%, and 54.6% for small, medium, and large apartment complexes, respectively. We conclude that although the additional cost required to meet G-SEED certification criteria increases with the size of the development; green investment is profitable at all scales considered in this study.

AB  - Globally, the building sector consumes approximately 60% of the total energy usage, while the energy consumption of residential buildings lies between 20% to 40%. The majority of this energy is operational energy, which comes mainly from the heating and cooling of houses. Innovative and cost-effective insulation materials have the potential to reduce the operational energy requirements and can therefore make the buildings more energy efficient. In this study, three commonly available insulation materials were experimentally evaluated for a case study of residential buildings, located in a cold region of Pakistan. Glass wool, extruded polystyrene, and polyethylene were used, as insulation materials, for monitoring the case study building performance. Thermal data were collected for 21 days in the year 2019 using a Testo Saveries System and were then used for analyzing the thermal performance of each of the three types of insulation materials. Other relevant data including the cost of insulation materials, thickness, ease of application, design life, and fire resistance of the selected insulation materials were obtained for broader (based on the scorecard) analysis based on a multi-weighted decision model. It was concluded that Polyethylene was the most economical insulation material amongst the others, which also showed the best thermal performance. Polyethylene was also found to be the best insulation material for the case study building based on a multi-weighted decision model and, hence, is recommended for application in buildings around cold regions of Pakistan.

T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Energy efficiency in private rental properties is lower than that of owner-occupied homes. As landlords are the primary decision-makers for improving rental properties, understanding their energy efficiency behaviour is critical to improving the uptake of energy efficiency retrofits in the private rental sector. However, little is known about how landlords make decisions about energy efficiency retrofits. The study aims to understand when and why landlords decide to retrofit and identify policy implications, using the private rental sector in Victoria as a case study. The results show that proactive retrofitting by landlords is rare and that the retrofits undertaken were generally low-cost, incremental energy efficiency improvements. Most retrofit activity was prompted by gov-ernment subsidies, tenant requests, or appliance breakdown. Despite its significance for energy efficiency, ret-rofitting behaviour was not related to environmental values. Instead, landlords considered financial implications and tenants' needs. However, landlords who used property managers had little understanding of tenants' needs. Policymakers can use this understanding of landlords' behaviour by creating new retrofit prompts and high-lighting the impacts of energy inefficiency on tenants' wellbeing. Transitioning the private rental sector to low-energy housing requires integrated policy to change the behaviour of landlords, tenants, and property managers.

AB  - In 1978, California adopted building codes designed to reduce the energy used for temperature control. Using a rich data set of hourly electricity consumption for 158,112 houses in Sacramento, we estimate that the average house built just after 1978 uses 8% to 13% less electricity for cooling than a similar house built just before 1978. Comparing the estimated savings to the policy's projected cost, our results suggest the policy passes a cost-benefit test. In settings where market failures prevent energy costs from being completely passed through to home prices, building codes can serve as a cost- effective tool for improving energy efficiency.

TI  - The Effect of the Swiss CO2 Levy on Heating Fuel Demand of Private Real Estate Owners
AU  - Francescutto, N

T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - To effectively mitigate climate change, it is crucial to better understand the reaction of fossil-fuel demand to price and tax changes, and more precisely to climate policy instruments such as a carbon levy. The Swiss CO2 levy on heating fuels was introduced in 2008 at CHF 12/tCO(2)eq, and was increased steadily up to CHF 84/tCO(2)eq during the period of 2016/2017. This paper investigated the effectiveness of the levy as an instrument to reduce heating fuel demand, and hence carbon emissions, of private real estate owners. The Swiss Household Budget Survey 2006-2017 constituted the main data source. Before-after and pseudo-panel regressions were used to capture the CO2 levy's effects, and a large set of household characteristics, as well as climatic conditions, were controlled for. No significant effects in the first two policy periods of 2008-2013 were found. Over the period of 2014-2017, a significant reduction in house owners' heating fuel demand of up to 14% with respect to 2006-2007 was detected. The effect was less significant and smaller in magnitude for flat owners. A significant CO2 levy semielasticity of heating fuel demand of -1.3% for house owners was further estimated. Hence, the results confirmed the effectiveness of the CO2 levy under the conditions that the levy was sufficiently high, as during the years of 2014-2017, and households directly paid the levy and were responsible for decisions concerning heating and insulation, as was the case for house owners.

AB  - Proposed sustainable transition pathways for moving away from natural gas in domestic heating focus on two main energy vectors: electricity and hydrogen. Electrification would be implemented by using vapour-compression heat pumps, which are currently experiencing market growth in many countries. On the other hand, hydrogen could substitute natural gas in boilers or be used in thermally-driven absorption heat pumps. In this paper, a consistent thermodynamic and economic methodology is developed to assess the competitiveness of these options. The three technologies, along with the option of district heating, are for the first time compared for different weather/ambient conditions and fuel-price scenarios, first from a homeowner's and then from a whole-energy system perspective. For the former, two-dimensional decision maps are generated to identify the most cost-effective technologies for different combinations of fuel prices. It is shown that, in the UK, hydrogen technologies are economically favourable if hydrogen is supplied to domestic end-users at a price below half of the electricity price. Otherwise, electrification and the use of conventional electric heat pumps will be preferred. From a whole-energy system perspective, the total system cost per household (which accounts for upstream generation and storage, as well as technology investment, installation and maintenance) associated with electric heat pumps varies between 790 and 880 & POUND;/year for different scenarios, making it the least-cost decarbonisation pathway. If hydrogen is produced by electrolysis, the total system cost associated with hydrogen technologies is notably higher, varying between 1410 and 1880 & POUND;/year. However, this total system cost drops to 1150 & POUND;/year with hydrogen produced cost-effectively by methane reforming and carbon capture and storage, thus reducing the gap between electricity-and hydrogen-driven technologies.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Why do consumers make different decisions even when socioeconomic conditions are similar? The present article examines the effects of human values-as formulations of motivational goals-on the decision to purchase electricity storage for a photovoltaic system, a phenomenon hardly explored in prior research regarding high-priced household investments. About 50 percent of photovoltaic-system owners in Germany are also owners of an electricity storage. This study aims to explore the more deeply rooted motivational factors behind these different decisions to extend our understanding of consumers' decision-making processes regarding energy-efficiency investments. It is based on an online survey of 460 owners of residential photovoltaic systems in Germany in 2019 and focuses on the interplay between higher-order values, purchase decisions, perceived risk, and environmental concern. The analysis of the higher-order values showed direct effects of conservation and self-transcendence and indirect effects of openness to change and self-enhancement, both mediated by perceived risk.

AB  - The real estate industry is associated with coal production and CO2 emissions. The nonlinear ARDL (AutoRegressive Distributed Lag) co-integration method was used to analyze the effects of long-term and short-term real estate development and CO2 emissions on coal production. The results showed that: (1) The positive and negative impacts of CO2 emissions on coal production were similar in the long. Moreover, CO2 emissions negatively affected coal production; (2) In the long run, the positive impact of real estate development on coal production is greater than the negative impact, though it is not significant. In the short term, the negative shock of real estate effectively reduced coal production; (3) The impact of coal production on CO2 emissions is symmetric in both the long and short term. Therefore, in the future, real estate should develop moderately. In addition, lessening coal production demand is crucial to ensure coal production reduction and carbon neutrality.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB  - China has witnessed a rapid growth of green building in the past few years. Green building development in residential sector is relatively slow. This paper provides nuanced evidence for explaining the slow growth of green residential building (GRB) based on a case study of the market in Shenzhen. This paper uses hedonic pricing models with a unique transaction dataset to find out an average price discount of 11.94% for GRB in second-hand housing market. Such price discount of GRB grows as housing price rises, insinuating that expensive housing obtains greater economic loss from green label. Our findings drawn from employing heterogeneity analysis show that the GRBs being sold in spring and winter tend to have a smaller price discount than those sold in summer and autumn. The GRBs with more rooms and parlors, however, tend to have a greater price discount in second-hand housing market. Our findings confirm that both building age and distance to central business district (CBD) offset the value loss resulting from green label. This study conveys a negative message to the economic return of GRB in China's second-hand housing market. Our findings advocate strong policy incentives to promote demand for GRB and reduce pertinent market barriers.

TI  - Analysing the drivers of the efficiency of households in electricity consumption
AU  - Romero-Jordan, D
AU  - del Rio, P
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Households play a very relevant role in energy demand in general and electricity demand in particular. Although electricity is an essential product in our daily life, reductions of electricity demand have generally been defended on environmental and energy security grounds. The aim of this paper is to analyse the level and the drivers of efficiency in household electricity consumption using an estimator for endogenous stochastic frontiers. A panel of data is built for this purpose, using statistical matching techniques with seven waves of the Spanish Household Budget Survey (SHBS) from 2006 to 2012. Several economic and non-economic variables are considered, including income, household features and characteristics of the dwelling. Our findings suggest that the level of electricity efficiency is already relatively high for households in all income levels. The results also reveal that there is a negative relation between income and efficiency in electricity consumption, i.e., that the lowest income households are also the most efficient. Furthermore, one feature of dwellings (the number of rooms) and two features of households (their size and the educational level) are relevant drivers of household efficiency in electricity consumption. Whereas the educational level and household size negatively affect electricity efficiency, the number of rooms positively influences efficiency. Our findings suggest that general price-based measures which drive the adoption of electricity efficient technologies and behaviors should be complemented with two types of policy interventions: policies which encourage households to be more efficient (i.e., information pro-vision and financial support for the adoption of electricity-efficient practices) and measures specifically targeted at low-income households which mitigate the comparatively greater distributional impact of price increases on this household segment.

TI  - Valuing sustainability Part 2: Australian valuers' perception of sustainability in valuation practice
AU  - Warren-Myers, G
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The research investigates valuers' understanding of the value of sustainability in property and its' consideration in valuation practice in Australia. This paper explores valuers' perceptions of the relationships between sustainability and market values, sustainability and valuation variables, and the value influence of industry sustainability certification schemes. Further, this paper tracks prevalence of certified buildings in Australian commercial markets and the evolution of valuers' knowledge of sustainability certifications used in Australia. Design/methodology/approach This paper reports on the next rendition of a longitudinal study examining valuers' practice in Australia. This research explores the evolution of Australian valuers' perception and knowledge of sustainability in valuation practice. The survey data has been periodically collected from practising valuers from 2007 to 2021. The survey questions investigate valuers' knowledge development, understanding, reporting and consideration of the relationship between sustainability and market value. Findings The results have identified the evolution of the influence of normative research on valuers' perceptions of the relationship between sustainability and value; with a clearer understanding emerging over time of where the value relationships are identified in valuation variables. Greater alignment between empirical Australian studies and valuers' perceptions of the influence of sustainability ratings on value, demonstrate the value connection for higher rated buildings under NABERS (energy rating) and Green Star. Whilst only 41% of the study's participants are including sustainability in their valuation reports, they include a higher level of commentary on building descriptions and initiatives, building ratings, and reporting of owner and tenant objectives, than in previous studies. Knowledge development relating to sustainability certification tool, NABERS was identified. This is likely linked to the introduction of mandatory disclosure legislation. This has also led to increased awareness and valuers' knowledge of the differences between the two key rating tools used in Australia. Research limitations/implications The research has several limitations: firstly, recruitment of valuers and the number of valuers' responses has varied over time; secondly, due to collection methods respondents have a greater likelihood of having an interest in and knowledge of sustainability creating potential for positive bias; thirdly, respondents may have responded to the survey in different years, but due to anonymity there has been no ability to track this. The results provide insights into the Australian valuation profession but may not be fully representative of the profession overall in Australia. Practical implications The broader agenda of net zero, climate change, mitigation and carbon requirements, whether driven by market forces or government legislation, are generating changes in property markets as investors' reconsider their positions and model the implications of carbon emissions on their bottom lines. Introductions of policy and legislation over time in the Australian context have led to changes in valuation practice and increasing consideration of energy efficiency and ratings in the valuation of assets.
However, further guidance and research still is required in Australia to assist in the knowledge development of valuers, and their ability to consider the emerging effects of sustainability, net zero and other market driven objectives including legislation, and how these may affect or influence their evaluation of market evidence and thus property values. Originality/value The research has tracked valuers' understanding, knowledge, and consideration of sustainability and energy efficiency in valuation practice since 2007. In that time the research has found that, as the market has evolved and more rated buildings are built (or retrofitted), so too has valuers' knowledge and consideration in valuation practices evolved. Valuers are more engaged with industry rating tools such as NABERS. This suggests that the Australian mandatory disclosure policies have contributed to changes in the market, which are then interpreted by valuers and reflected in their perceptions and consideration of energy ratings in valuation practice.

AB  - Purpose The research investigates valuers' understanding of the value of sustainability in property and its consideration in valuation practice. The paper explores the extant research that has examined valuers' perceptions of the relationships between sustainability and market values, sustainability measurement, value relationships and the standards and guidelines released industry bodies. Design/methodology/approach This paper, part 1 of 2, reports the current state of play of valuation research in the consideration of sustainability in valuation practice and the role of industry bodies in the guidance regarding sustainability consideration in valuation. The second paper provides the next rendition of a longitudinal study examining valuation practice in Australia. Findings The paper provides an overview of the evolution of the consideration of sustainability in property over the past two decades. Providing insights of how the property sector, its markets and valuation professionals have responded to answering the questions of: what is the value of sustainability? Whilst earlier publications both industry and academic publications alike focussed on the normative aspects of how sustainability should affect value, more recent research starts to ascertain the implications of sustainability on property values. Despite industry bodies providing information, education, guidelines and standards, it would seem that valuers in their practice are still grappling with the challenges of understanding the rapidly evolving area of sustainability, environmental, social and governance and climate risks in valuations. Research limitations/implications The paper does not present as an authority on all research that has been conducted to date, it provides an overview of the evolving nature of both academic research and industry consideration of sustainability, particularly in a valuation context. This provides the background for Part 2. Practical implications The broader agenda of net zero, climate change, mitigation and carbon requirements, whether driven by market forces or government legislation, are generating substantial changes in property markets, as investors reconsider their positions and model the implications of carbon emissions on their bottom lines. Government policies appear to have a considerable influence over market behaviours, which filters through to stakeholder decision-making. However, despite government policies, clear market signalling and industry body guidance on valuing sustainability, the content and depth of sustainability consideration in valuation are still limited. Originality/value The paper provides an overview of the last decade of research into the value of sustainability and the evolving nature of information and guidance for valuers to identify, evaluate and consider sustainability in valuation.

AU  - Lee, CL

T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Extensive studies have examined the financial performance of green buildings in recent years. The results have frequently observed that the premium of green buildings is time-varying and dependent on the study period and markets being examined. Further, virtually no dedicated study has been devoted to examine the role of mandatory building energy rating disclosure policies on green building price premium. This raises the question of whether the mandatory energy rating disclosure policies would have an influence on the financial performance of green buildings. This study assesses the premium of green buildings by considering the role of mandatory energy efficiency of commercial building disclosure program (CBDP) using the MCSI/IPD NABERS data over 2005-2020. The results of the study showed that, in Australia, buildings with NABERS rating of 4 stars and above delivered a higher total return compared with buildings with lower NABERS ratings. This also supports the Freeman's (1984) social impact hypothesis in which favorable social performance will ultimately lead to favorable financial performance. In addition, our empirical modelling results also demonstrated the premium of green buildings is stronger since the launch of CBDP, reflecting the importance of mandatory building efficiency disclosure. The policy implications of our studies have also been discussed as buildings play a crucial role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly net-zero carbon emissions.

AB  - In Hungary, regulated energy prices fell by a quarter in 2013-2014 due to a state intervention. The objective of this article is to measure the effects of this change on the Hungarian residential energy consumption and assess the rationale, the policy context and other consequences of such an intervention. We decompose residential energy-use change in 2010-2018. We calculate 13.2 PJ of excess consumption relating to the programme, and find that the higher income deciles benefited the most from the lower prices compared to low-income households using market-priced lower-quality fuels and living in inefficient homes. The intervention lacked a strong policy background. The energy policy documents were later adjusted to the situation and finally the programme was linked to energy poverty. We point to price-setting failures and discrepancies between energy-efficiency goals and measures as well as negative effects of these and the programme itself. In the future, the policy emphasis should be on energy efficiency and supporting those really in need.

AB  - Purpose Energy conservation literacy within households is a contemporary and topical issue globally. However, scant research has been conducted on energy-saving literacy amongst Ghanaian households. To substantiate the problem, this paper aims to examine energy conservation literacy and behaviours among Ghanaian households in the Greater Accra Region. Design/methodology/approach The study assessed household electricity use and explored determinants of household energy conservation behaviours. Data was collected through a survey administered to households within the target region and analysed using descriptive statistics and Spearmen's rank correlation. Findings Results showed electricity conservation among households is greatly influenced by the number of household occupants, household income levels, and the quality and quantity of appliances. The study also found that conservation behaviours are positively correlated to the number of occupants, household income levels, the quantity of electrical appliances, age of household members, number of rooms and level of urbanization within the home's geographical region. Cumulatively, the findings suggest households held positive attitudes towards efficient energy practices. Enigmatically, the use of energy-conserving alternative technologies was not widely used by households; hence, this factor does not significantly affect household energy conservation. Research limitations/implications Although limited to Ghana's capital region, the findings can be used to inform policy and regulations at the regional and national levels in designing an efficient and effective mechanism to reduce the country's overall energy use. Practical implications Premised upon the findings, the study recommends an intensification of education and awareness-creation on various energy-saving regulations and initiatives and thorough education on the usage of standardized (approved) refrigerators to promote the consistent adoption of energy conservation measures among households. Originality/value This study pioneers investigations into the influence of household demographic variables on overall electricity conservation behaviours exhibited by Ghanaian households

T2  - CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS
AB  - In recent decades, energy-efficiency improvements and ageing dwelling stocks have grown the renovation need in many countries. This research compares the profitability of building renovation companies and companies specializing in new construction using financial statement analysis and analysis of variance. Profitability is assessed through EBITDA and return on assets (ROA). Debt to equity (D/E) ratio as a solvency measure supports the analysis. The findings show micro and small companies in the new building sector have a statistically significant advantage in EBITDA over renovation in same size groups; projects in the renovation sector appear to be more complex, especially in terms of design, causing cost overruns. The more cyclical nature of new construction, however, equalizes EBITDA differences over time. Medium-size companies overall had the lowest EBITDA following the 2008-2009 financial crisis. ROA was generally higher for the renovation sector highlighting the more capital-intensive nature of new construction; unsold apartments and land for future projects hold capital, which results in higher D/E ratios. D/E ratios also revealed that both sectors have faced the COVID-19 pandemic less indebted compared to the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Since both sectors' profitability has been decreasing during the research period (2005-2019), actions are needed especially in the renovation sector, which has an increasingly important role in developed societies.

AB  - In this study, the economic feasibility of green remodeling (GR), which could improve the health, safety, and energy of elderly households considering social cost, was analyzed. As a result, the net present value of GR was '-10,267 USD (49.7%)', which was found to be uneconomical compared to the total construction cost (20,981 USD, 100%) despite benefits of energy saving, carbon reduction, and air pollutant reduction. Based on this result, in order to expand GR for low-income elderly households, who cannot afford to perform GR, a GR support measure linked to the currently implemented energy conversion and old-age housing support policies was proposed. It allows the government to perform GR for low-income elderly households with 1/4 of the total construction cost. This result could revitalize GR to reduce greenhouse gas and contribute to housing stability for low-income elderly households who are vulnerable to COVID-19 and climate change.

AB  - The accumulation of properties by Spanish banks during the crisis of the first decade of the 21st century has definitely changed the housing market. An optimal house price valuation is useful to determine the bank's actual financial situation. Furthermore, properties valued according to the market can be sold in a shorter span of time and at a better price. Using a sample of 24,781 properties and a simulation exercise, we aim to identify the decision criteria that Spanish banking used to decide which properties were going to be sold and at what price. The results of the comparison among four methods used to value real estate-artificial neural networks, semi log regressions, a combined model by means of weighted least squares regression, and quantile regressions-and the actual situation suggest that banking aimed to maximize the reversal of impairment losses, although this would mean capital losses, selling less properties, and decreasing their revenues. Therefore, the actual combined result was very detrimental to banking and, consequently, to the Spanish society because of its banking bailout.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study examines the impact of energy management and productivity-enhancing measures, implemented as part of LEED Existing Buildings Operations and Management (EBOM) certification, on source energy use intensity and rental premiums of office spaces using data on four major US markets. Energy management practices, comprised of commissioning and advanced metering, may reduce energy usage. Conversely, improving air quality and occupant comfort in an effort to increase worker productivity may in turn lead to higher overall energy consumption. The willingness to pay for these features in rental office buildings is hypothesised to depend not only on the extent to which productivity gains enhance the profits of a commercial tenant but also on the lease arrangements for passing any energy savings to the tenant. We apply a difference-in-differences method at a LEED EBOM certification group level and a multi-level modelling approach with a panel data structure. The results indicate that energy management and indoor environment practices have the expected effect on energy consumption as described above. However, the magnitude of the achieved rental premiums appears to be independent of the lease type.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the area under rapeseed cultivation on the economic performance and organization of farms. The study was conducted in 164 rapeseed farms in different Polish voivodeships. A targeted sampling procedure was used to select farms for the study. The studied population was divided into four groups depending on area under rapeseed cultivation rates. The selected farms were located in voivodeships with the highest rapeseed acreage rates of the total cropped area. The economic performance of the examined farms improved with increases in rapeseed area. Farms with larger rapeseed areas were characterized by higher production values and better economic performance. On average, the total production value per farm was highest in the group of farms with rapeseed areas of 20.1-30 ha. Similar results were noted when total production values were expressed per ha of arable land, per full-time employee and per man-hour. Total production value was lowest in farms with the smallest rapeseed areas. Farms with the largest areas under rapeseed cultivation achieved the highest farm household income. The farm household income values per full-time employee and per man-hour were highest in farms with the largest areas under rapeseed cultivation. The values of fixed assets and current assets increased with increases in rapeseed area. Most farms were run by owners with secondary school education. The highest percentages of farmers with university education were noted in farms with rapeseed areas of 10-20.1 ha (37.5%) and above 30 ha (30.4%). The vast majority of farms from all groups were run by male farmers. The research results could be useful for policy makers, because they indicate that rapeseed production can not only be profitable but can also be used for biofuel production.

AB  - The Horizon 2020 framework programme is defining funding strategies for research and innovation projects in European cities and promoting policies and solutions for the transition to a competitive energy system at an urban scale. Given that Horizon Europe, thanks to the Driving Urban Transition Partnership, will fund RD&I projects regarding transitions to urban sustainability; how municipalities will implement different strategies is a relevant key to developing replicable models. We conducted this study on Italian cities through a mapping exercise on selected case studies. The aim was to provide a knowledge framework to municipalities undertaking sustainable urban development actions. We selected case studies based on energy efficiency in buildings, both in retrofits and new constructions. This highlighted how the adoption of multifaceted technological solutions blended well with each other, and led, not only, to satisfy the initial requirements, in terms of expected impacts from the single actions, but also provided relevant and replicable samples. For this, the analysis of solutions tested by different municipalities in the selected projects led to spreadsheets and indicators related to energy efficiency in buildings, which enabled a transition to a PED, which could facilitate an understanding of elements that must be clearly indicated in a preliminary design document (Directive 2014/24/UE).

T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - Greater uptake of solar panels on rental housing would have implications for housing affordability and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The influence of energy investments on housing values has been widely studied, with past research often finding a positive relationship. However, there is missing knowledge for the specific relationship between solar panels and housing rents. This study finds that Australian renters with solar panels pay approximately A$19 more in weekly housing rents than non-solar renters. The results suggest that landlords have been able to benefit from investments in solar panels through higher rent, with a payback period of around 5 years. The study provides context for policymakers across the world considering subsidies for solar panels on rental housing. The findings are robust across multiple methods including entropy balancing and are based on two large Australian household surveys.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION
AB  - Purpose To improve building performance and meet statutory carbon reduction targets, a radical transformation of existing UK building stock is needed. Much previous research on building performance has focussed on large-scale construction. However, retrofit of existing housing stock - which will contribute the majority of the requisite efficiency improvement - is carried out by practitioners in the repair-maintain-improve (RMI) subsector. These practitioners are the sole traders and micro-firms who constitute two-fifths of employment in the construction sector. The study aims to examine the factors influencing these practitioners in RMI work to understand how better to engage them with improved building performance. Design/methodology/approach A total of 31 semi-structured interviews were conducted with RMI professionals from around the UK and analysed using template analysis. Findings The analysis identified capabilities of the practitioners who influence building performance, including knowledge and co-ordination of people and resources; opportunities including state action and customer demand; and motivations including pride in work, customer care and satisfaction, maintaining a viable business and working relationships. Research limitations/implications The participants were a small, mixed group in terms of firm size and specialisation. The qualitative approach adopted provided detailed insights but does not make claims for statistical generalisability or representativeness of the findings. Future work could look to extend the findings with a statistically representative survey. Practical implications For a successful transition to high standards of building performance, modelling is not enough. Initiatives are needed to address the multiple factors which determine engagement in energy-efficient retrofit: capacities, opportunities and motivations. The desire of RMI practitioners to meet customer expectations could be used to develop pragmatic building performance evaluation, guided by householder satisfaction criteria. Originality/value The study examined the attitudes and experiences of an under-researched sector who are essential to the delivery of improved building performance. This study makes a novel contribution by applying an established psychological model of behaviour change, the capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour model, for the first time in this domain.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - PV energy generates economic and environmental benefits (e.g., energy cost-saving, GHG emissions reduction, etc.), which can be capitalized into market prices. There is, therefore, growing interest in assessing the value that PV systems add to solar homes (i.e., homes equipped with PV production plants) market prices. Although the number of solar homes has experienced rapid growth in Europe and Italy, literature investigating the impact of PV power plants on home values is still very limited. This paper aims to fill this gap. We implement a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) approach to estimate individuals' WTP for different typologies of domestic PV plants, which vary in technical characteristics. Our findings show that homebuyers are willing to pay a price premium for solar homes, ranging from some 3% to some 15%, depending on PV panels' characteristics. These results can provide a wealth of recommendations to different interested parties such as homeowners, homebuyers, realtors, and governments, seeking knowledge on the capitalization effect of residential PV plants on the housing market to implement cost-effective investment strategies or design optimal policy incentives.

T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - The energy turnaround created a high volatility in the energy production based on renewable energy. To integrate renewable energy economically in buildings and smart cities an additional concept of energy storage and energy supply based on energy management concepts must be claimed. The political views have changed during the last years and energy efficiency in buildings is seen important because 35% of greenhouse gas is produced by the final energy consumption. The deployment of local energy production concepts is an important step to energy turnaround. To generate and distribute energy effectively in buildings, digital components such as sensors, actuators, meters, and energy management systems must be installed in the buildings and the digital components must be able to communicate via communication networks. The paper describes systems for local energy generation, necessary communication networks for buildings and smart cities and digitization applications in industrial buildings. As an example of energy management, the Oktett64 system is presented, which is based on Enterprise IT technology and has implemented AI and blockchain technology. Digitalization with platforms such as Oktett64 are based on technologies that are superior to today's often commercially available Programmable Logic Controllers. The article also shows how the future mobile communications standards 5G beyond and 6G can offer special solutions for the digitization of buildings in their edge clouds.

AB  - Spanish residential buildings built in the decade of the housing bubble (2000-2009) had to comply with the Basic Buildings Standard on thermal conditions in buildings. At the end of this period, the Basic Energy Savings Document of the Technical Building Code published in the Royal Decree 314/2006, transposing European Directive 2002/91/EC, entered into force. Recently, this regulatory framework has been updated by the Royal Decree 732/2019, which transposes European Directives 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2018/844/EU. A case study is used to analyse the energy, emissions and economic impact of these regulatory changes on an attached house located in all municipalities of Andalusia (South of Spain). The thermal behaviour of this house is compared with the one adapted to the new regulations. The TRNSYS transient system simulation tool is used for the energy study. The house adaptation is carried out by partially modifying the envelope, including a solarthermal contribution to domestic hot water supply, and photovoltaic energy production to reduce electricity consumption. The results showed that the European objectives are greatly exceeded. Energy savings range from 69% to 127%, carbon dioxide emissions decrease by 65%-118%, and energy bills are reduced from 71% to 125%.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionising how energy is delivered from energy producers and used throughout residential households. Optimising the residential energy consumption is a crucial step toward having greener and sustainable energy production. Such optimisation requires a household-centric energy management system as opposed to a one-rule-fits all approach. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-layer digital twin of the energy system that aims to mirror households' actual energy consumption in the form of a household digital twin (HDT). When linked to the energy production digital twin (EDT), HDT empowers the household-centric energy optimisation model to achieve the desired efficiency in energy use. The model intends to improve the efficiency of energy production by flattening the daily energy demand levels. This is done by collaboratively reorganising the energy consumption patterns of residential homes to avoid peak demands whilst accommodating the resident needs and reducing their energy costs. Indeed, our system incorporates the first HDT model to gauge the impact of various modifications on the household energy bill and, subsequently, on energy production. The proposed energy system is applied to a real-world IoT dataset that spans over two years and covers seventeen households. Our conducted experiments show that the model effectively flattened the collective energy demand by 20.9% on synthetic data and 20.4% on a real dataset. At the same time, the average energy cost per household was reduced by 10.7% for the synthetic data and 17.7% for the real dataset.

AU  - Alamel, A
T2  - AREA
AB  - With the growing number of students in higher education, the student housing market has been becoming increasingly competitive and diversified. This intensification has led housing providers to supply all-inclusive energy packages (i.e., the inclusion of electricity, gas, and water in the rent cost) to their tenants as a selling point. By connecting the geographies of students and energy, this paper aims to assess the magnitude of all-inclusive energy packages and its effects on students' residential choices. Based on an online survey distributed to students at Loughborough University (UK), the paper shows that 80% of housing occupied by students is energy-inclusive. These rental commodities are strongly considered by students, particularly new university entrants, in their housing choices, 70% of whom considered all-inclusive rent to be an important factor in their residential choice. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that all-inclusive energy packages are extensively provided throughout the student housing market: from the low-energy efficient houses in multiple occupancy to the newly developed purpose-built student accommodation. Finally, the paper underpins how providing energy-inclusive rent tends to produce energy inequities by shielding some students from being in fuel poverty.

TI  - Housing market segmentation and the price effect of certified green residential properties
AU  - Hui, ECM

T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - One important yet overlooked theme in the literature regarding green building certifications (GBC) is the latent differences in pricing behaviors among property buyers in different housing market segments. Specifically, are buyers in the mass housing market willing to pay larger premiums (in terms of the % above average prices) for properties in certified buildings than buyers in the luxury market? This question is particularly crucial for highrise environments in which properties belonging to different housing sub-markets are within the same building. This, in turn, could have profound implications for the availability of housing flats of varying sizes in certified green residential buildings. This study, therefore, explores this issue by comparing price premiums, if any, for living space in buildings certified with several green building certifications in the two housing sub-markets in Hong Kong. Utilizing a sample of over 220,000 transactions, the main finding is that buyers in the mass housing market were generally willing to pay larger price premiums for properties in certified buildings than buyers in the luxury housing market, unless the certification represented noticeable and actual (not simulated) improvements in the overall environmental performance or energy performance. Implications for different stakeholders are then discussed based on the findings.

AU  - Lambourne, T
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine if there is an impact of sustainability on the market in terms of a green premium or a brown discount on the price of commercial and residential real estate. It also seeks to identify the incentives and barriers for sustainable developments perceived by real estate professionals. Design/methodology/approach The paper investigates the impact of sustainability features on the valuation of buildings in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study uses a qualitative structured questionnaire to determine the views of certified real estate valuers and advisors on this subject. Findings The results suggest a green premium of at least 1% in the UAE, coming from both supply-side and demand-side, and in commercial and residential sectors. Key barriers for the recognition of green building value include availability of reliable market data, lack of relevant technical skills and apparent client disinterest. Initiatives that would encourage green buildings include financial incentives for key stakeholders, raising and enforcing building standards, and higher energy prices. This paper identifies policy measures that local authorities may consider in transforming to a more sustainable economy. It is expected that such changes would convey to the real estate industry and affiliated stakeholders the financial benefits to be gained from investing in green buildings. Research limitations/implications The UAE is not a transparent environment in terms of building prices and rents, and it can be challenging even for experienced professionals to determine whether an observed higher value can truly be considered a green premium. The second issue is that the results may be affected by a "voluntary response bias", whereby recipients who are interested in sustainability are more likely to have responded to the survey. Practical implications This paper identifies policy measures that local authorities may consider in transforming to a more sustainable economy. It is expected that such changes would convey to the real estate industry and affiliated stakeholders the financial benefits to be gained from investing in green buildings. Originality/value Most research exploring the value of green buildings originates from developed economies and its applicability to the Middle East is questionable due to its differing origins and unusual development path. This article offers new insights into an under-researched market.

Due to increasing concerns about the environment and the impact of investment on society at large, public property companies have made significant progress in improving transparency and enhancing the protection of shareholder value by sharing and reporting ESG best practices. We explore and review the EPRA sBPR database, which is highly useful for investors who are already screening listed real estate companies. Hence, in this project, we carefully study the diffusion process of this new ESG metric as a tool to enhance informational transparency regarding public real estate investment management and assess the effects of this transparency and ESG performance for the real estate stock returns. We find evidence of a sustainability premium that investors are willing to pay to access companies with better sustainable ratings.

T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Behavioral strategies of occupant energy conservation are essential to counter the effect of growing energy demand. The wide application of occupant energy interventions, such as providing subsidies to promote energy saving, involves continuous financial investments, which has been a particular challenge to subsidy providers, i.e. national energy agencies. Exploring the cost-effective interventions is essential in the case of promoting household energy conservation in the long term. In this study, a promising strategy to lighten the financial burden of energy policy providers - Household Energy Saving Option (HESO) is proposed and validated. HESO is an option-based strategy that offers buyers (i.e. households) an opportunity to earn the reward, depending on whether they can achieve the pre-determined energy saving goal. A conceptual framework of HESO is established, which consists of five elements, namely theoretical foundation (T), integrated interventions (I), market premises (M), energy sustainability (E), and stakeholders (S). To test the effectiveness of HESO on household energy reduction, a preliminary experiment was conducted in 101 households living in Singapore and the results demonstrated that HESO has a positive effect on encouraging home electricity conservation based on the Difference-in-Difference (DID) analysis. Compared to the baseline of household energy consumption, HESO-induced energy reduction was 8.18% and 12.56% when saving goals were set at 5% and 10%, respectively. Possible reasons to explain different effects of HESO on energy reduction have been elaborated, including the effect of positive feedback and re-adjustment of households' energy saving motivation during the transition period. Key determinants of HESO's success have also been discussed, such as management of cash-flow liquidity and design of goal difficulty. HESO shifts costs from energy policy providers to the households who fail to achieve their goals, which significantly improves the cost-efficiency of residential energy reduction strategies. This study contributes to the literature by developing a framework of option-based residential energy saving intervention. The results enlighten a promising and scalable solution by using a marketized intervention for promoting effective energy conservation in households while minimizing the cost burden borne by the city government.

AB  - UAVs are increasingly incorporated in a wide range of domains such as disaster management and rescue missions. UAV path planning deals with finding the most optimal or shortest path for UAVs such that minimum energy and resources are utilized. This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning's key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance.

T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - We extend the commonly-studied definition of investment in sustainable and energy efficient real estate beyond environmental building certification to include three additional types of environmentally-focused building interventions: environmentally-focused capital expenditure (capex); monitoring; and, tenant engagement. Appealing to behavioral economics and finance theory, we test for a connection between changes in tenant and property management behavior and electricity consumption. Through a partnership with a global institutional investment manager, this study examines ten years of asset-level operating statement and electricity consumption data in Canadian and U.S. office buildings, measuring both the initial impact of such interventions as well as any adjustments observed over time. Analysis of the proprietary intervention data allows us to better understand the impact of varied environmental interventions on the electricity consumption of commercial real estate. We find that all four intervention categories, including building certification, are associated with decreased electricity consumption, with tenant engagement providing an immediate decrease that is maintained over time. Environmentally-focused capex is also associated with decreased electricity consumption in both Canada and the U.S. Taken together the results indicate that utility consumption and its associated costs are only minimized when multiple environmental interventions are implemented.

AB  - During the last two decades, the European Union regulation has paid more and more attention to the issue of energy efficiency, especially as far as the building sector is concerned. Lately, the adoption of the European Green Deal (EGD) has further fueled interest in the topic. The building industry is expected to step forward towards decarbonization, as well as to mobilize towards a clean and circular economy, so supporting the pursuit of climate neutrality. In this position paper, we aim to discuss three major issues at stake, which are crucial to increase the renovation rate of the building stock and, hence, to the success of the EGD. The first key issue is whether a cost premium has to be expected due to retrofit projects. The second key issue is whether or not the large swing currently experienced in the price premium for building energy efficiency undermines stakeholders' confidence. The third key issue is whether we need tailored evaluation methodologies for energy-efficient building portfolios.

AB  - This article presents an economic framework for evaluating the net benefits or costs of building code regulations through their effect on housing markets, accounting for distributional impacts. The role of building codes can primarily be classified into three scenarios: (1) An industry standard that reduces transaction costs; (2) An isolated quality standard; or (3) A quality standard with spillover effects. To holistically evaluate the impact of a particular building regulation, we propose three major guidelines: (1) Correct market failures; (2) Estimate market impacts; and (3) Account for distributional considerations. This framework is applied to energy efficiency regulations and solar panels in particular. Energy efficiency codes reduce negative environmental externalities and information asymmetry and promote high-quality long-term affordable housing stock; however, the willingness to pay for energy efficiency varies with income. Policymakers must consider how policies intended to promote the welfare of low-income housing residents might create exclusionary impacts due to increasing the cost of supplying housing.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - As rural landscapes change in both geography and population, it is increasingly important to understand the unique challenges faced by these communities. Of notable significance is the rising cost of housing relative to household income - a measure often referred to as the housing cost-burden. Its subsequent effect on affordable and accessible housing is experienced on a national level, yet perceptions often place rural communities among the most vulnerable. The proceeding research seeks to challenge this notion and further analyze what rural residents, specifically rural renters, face in managing their housing costs. For instance, utilities are an often overlooked contribution to the severity of the overall burden. Their presence as fixed, unadjusted, housing costs lie in aggregate of more direct expenditures. While utilities may lack immediacy, they are pervasive in their prolonged impact. Therefore, it is a combination of factors that make sub-populations of rural areas more susceptible to housing cost externalities. The importance lies in the subtle differences, where considerable policy opportunities exist.

T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
AB  - This paper explores the determinants of household electricity consumption efficiency of an ageing population. The analysis is pursued for the 28 member states of the European Union between 2005 and 2016. These determinants are evaluated through the employment of the econometric method Fractional Regression Model. Results indicate that the share of renewables in heating and cooling, the government expenditures in housing and community and the housing cost burden below 60% for people aged 65 and over, are the main drivers that impulse the efficiency levels positively. On the other hand, the old age dependency ratio, and the housing cost burden above 60% for people aged 65 and over, affect the efficiency levels negatively. The main contribution of the study is to underline the relevance of the socio-economic household characteristics of an ageing population strata in explaining the residential electricity consumption efficiency.

TI  - The "green lemon" problem - a study of the effect of partial disclosure of poorer assessment ratings on housing prices
AU  - Hui, ECM
AU  - Yu, KH
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The introduction of green building certifications, on the one hand, can provide useful information for different stakeholders, such as developers and buyers, to evaluate "green" buildings' environmental performance. On the other hand, it gives rise to an issue resembling the "lemons" problem in New Institutional Economics, as sellers such as developers and owners of properties with poorer ratings do not disclose, or only partially disclose this information to the public. Given that a likely result of this "lemons" problem is lower average market prices that drive good products out of the market, this paper, thus, investigates this latent issue by assessing how the knowledge of these "lemons", referring to BEAM Plus-assessed buildings with an "Unclassified" rating, influences the price effect of BEAM Plus certification for other certified properties. Utilizing Bayesian Modeling, the findings indicate that should the "green lemons", or BEAM Plus-assessed properties with an Unclassified rating, be known, the price premium for other BEAM Plus-certified properties on Hong Kong Island and in the New Territories is higher than the scenario under which "green lemons" are not known as thus mistaken as non-assessed properties. This finding is akin to the traditional "lemons" issue which can result in the saturation of "lemons" in the market due to lower average prices that drive the good quality products out of it. This situation, we believe, is further exacerbated by the HKSAR government's GFA Concession Policy that grants GFA concessions to projects assessed under BEAM Plus regardless of rating, which is reflected by the high percentage of assessed projects with an "unclassified" rating. A higher degree of disclosure for these "lemons" compared to what is required now, according to the findings, could benefit potential investors and the BEAM Society alike. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Estimating the costs of green home improvements is not possible without accurate estimates of their impact on house prices. Now, Shen et al. use the sales data of more than 400,000 properties in the United States to determine how heat pump installations increase house prices.
Electrifying most fossil-fuel-burning applications provides a pathway to achieving cost-effective deep decarbonization of the economy. Heat pumps offer a feasible and energy-efficient way to electrify space heating. Here, we show a positive house price premium associated with air source heat pump installations across 23 states in the United States. Residences with an air source heat pump enjoy a 4.3-7.1% (or US$10,400-17,000) price premium on average. Residents who are environmentally conscious, middle class and live in regions with mild climate are more likely to pay a larger price premium. We find that estimated price premiums are larger than the calculated total social benefits of switching to heat pumps. Policymakers could provide information about the estimated price premium to influence the adoption of heat pumps.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Information on sustainability features in the Australian residential property market is available but not always shared with buyers by property practitioners (real estate agents, property valuers/appraisers and financiers/mortgage lenders and brokers), as it is not a regulatory requirement. This paper examines the perspectives of property practitioners on a range of sustainability features in residential property. Drawing insights from combined questionnaires and interviews, property practitioners seem to attribute different levels of importance to sustainability related information depending on whether they view the information from their professional perspective or from their clients' perspective. The results obtained in both 2015 and 2017 confirm that practitioners' perspectives seem to limit the amount and/or type of information they pass on to their clients. Clients are not considering sustainability features as they may not be aware on the existence of such information and are not informed by practitioners about the value of such information. If practitioners share more complete information within the property market buyers would be able to make more informed purchase decisions regarding energy efficiency, sustainable homes, and reduction in operation costs. The property practitioners themselves can utilise this information to have more targeted and information rich marketing strategies.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to develop a forecasting tool for the automatic assessment of both environmental and economic benefits resulting from low-carbon investments in the real estate sector, especially when applied in large building stocks. A set of four artificial neural networks (NNs) is created to provide a fast and reliable estimate of the energy consumption in buildings due to heating, hot water, cooling and electricity, depending on some specific buildings' characteristics, such as geometry, orientation, climate or technologies. Design/methodology/approach The assessment of the building's energy demand is performed comparing the as-is status (pre-retrofit) against the design option (post-retrofit). The authors associate with the retrofit investment the energy saved per year, and the net monetary saving obtained over the whole cost after a predetermined timeframe. The authors used a NN approach, which is able to forecast the buildings' energy demand due to heating, hot water, cooling and electricity, both in the as-is and in the design stages. The design stage is the result of a multiple attribute optimization process. Findings The approach here developed offers the opportunity to manage energy retrofit interventions on wide property portfolios, where it is necessary to handle simultaneously a large number of buildings without it being technically feasible to achieve a very detailed level of analysis for every property of a large portfolio. Originality/value Among the major accomplishments of this research, there is the creation of a methodology that is not excessively data demanding: the collection of data for building energy simulations is, in fact, extremely time-consuming and expensive, and this NN model may help in overcoming this problem. Another important result achieved in this study is the flexibility of the model developed. The case study the authors analysed was referred to one specific stock, but the results obtained have a more widespread importance because it ends up being only a matter of input-data entering, while the model is perfectly exportable in other contexts.

TI  - Energy, carbon, and cost analysis of rural housing retrofit in different climates
AU  - Tahsildoost, M
AU  - Zomorodian, Z
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - A large portion of rural residential buildings in developing countries neglecting climate and the low construction quality has resulted in high-energy consumption in this sector. Besides, low economic power and awareness make it difficult to invest in energy upgrades in rural areas. Therefore, low-cost energy retrofit strategies are required to reduce energy levels and improve occupants living conditions while minimizing adverse environmental effects. This study aims to define optimum retrofit strategies for rural buildings based on their economic viability, environmental impact, and comfort benefits in the form of a multi-criteria decision support tool for retrofit projects in four represented climates of Iran.
Three groups of retrofit strategies (architectural, constructional, and renewable) are modelled in four actual rural buildings in different climates. Environmental, economic, and comfort performance of each strategy is calculated via different indices by dynamic simulations. Energy consumption, carbon emission and cost (ECC) analysis are carried out. Different active and passive retrofit measures are evaluated via ECC.
The main result of this study is a multi-criteria decision making tool for prioritizing retrofitting strategies in rural houses in different climates. According to results, the primary energy demand is reduced between 46 and 55%, the carbon emission is reduced between 40 and 51%, and thermal comfort levels are improved up to 23% in different climate zones.
In line with the current market prices of Iran (high construction costs and low energy prices due to energy subsidies), the payback time for retrofit actions is not very appealing for the building owners. Thus, subsidizing should be dedicated to refurbishment strategies instead of energy. Also, widespread governmental supported programs should be administrated to educate and improve awareness, especially in low-income areas.

AB  - This study aims to review empirical research concerning the impact of green certificates on property cash flows and values, particularly from professional property investors' perspective. The study uses discounted cash flows (DCF), a widely used property valuation method in income-generating properties, as a methodological framework. In this study, over 70 peer-reviewed studies were identified, categorized, and analyzed in the DCF framework. The reviewed studies indicated that certificates might increase the rental income and decrease the operating expenses, vacancy, and risks of a property. Together with the brand value of certificates, these enhancements should lead to an increase in property value. The number of studies has grown rapidly during the 2010s. Lately, studies have developed from asset-level to portfolio-level examinations. Although the reviewed studies found certification to be beneficial, the range of reported benefits was wide, and over half of the studies concentrated on U.S. commercial real estate markets, with a strong focus on LEED and ENERGY STAR certificates. From a property valuation perspective, applying these results to other markets and certificates might be challenging. Property values that fully reflect the environmental performance of properties would be a key to motivate mainstream investors to adopt sustainable property features.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Apart from promoting social-economic development and increasing social employment, the real estate industry in China has also brought up problems such as high energy consumption and high emissions. Scholars now focus more on energy conservation, emission reduction and sustainable development of real estate companies in their current research. The data used by this paper are three-year panel data from 2015 to 2018, with observations from 15 representative real estate companies. CO2 and green credit index are introduced as the undesirable output and the green output of real estate companies respectively. First, with the DEA model and the Malmquist index model, this paper evaluates the green productivity of real estate companies statically and dynamically. The Tobit model is then employed by the author to analyze factors that may affect green productivity. Our results indicate that (1) the green productivities of 15 Chinese real estate companies have improved by various degrees. The average green productivity rises from 0.701 in 2015 to 0.849 in 2018, indicating that the energy utilization rate of enterprises has gradually increased. From the calculation and decomposition of the Malmquist total factor productivity index, we know that technological progress is vital in improving the green productivity of real estate companies. (2) As for the influencing factors, the green productivity is positively related to factors such as policy compliance indicator P, environmental responsibility commitment indicator R, indicator of green innovation capability I, and indicator of green development information disclosure M. The asset-liability ratio on the contrary has a negative impact on green productivity. It's worth to point out that the green innovation index and green productivity is significantly correlated and the correlation coefficient can be up to 0.636, which implies that the key to improving green productivity is to increase research and development investment.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL REAL ESTATE REVIEW
AB  - Many countries have implemented an energy labeling system that displays the energy savings performance of buildings. However, previous studies have reported mixed findings on the effectiveness of this system.
This study is undertaken in Japan to assess whether energy labels are effective and validate the significance of the label design. We use an online survey to determine the effects of energy labels on target consumers. We choose two energy label designs: one with a stairs rating form design and the second with a rating scale of the energy efficiency. Adopting a within-subjects method, each respondent shown both designs and asked to evaluate the energy-saving level based on the labels. Cross-tabulation confirms the positive effects of labeling on energy-savings levels, which are amplified by increasing the level of the reference point. The highest insulation performance level in Japan complies with a law enacted back in 1993; the results show that greater effects can be realized by increasing the level of the reference point.
A logistic regression analysis shows that energy labels with the stairs rating have a negative influence, while labels with a rating scale are preferred based on ease of understanding by the respondents. This suggests that energy labels that offer a rating scale can contribute to facilitating energy savings, although there are problems with the comprehension of the gradation colors which need to be further examined. These results can act as a guideline towards optimal designs of the upcoming task of modifying the energy labeling system in Japan.

AB  - Information problems have early been suspected to be the main barrier to energy-efficiency investment. I review the vast yet piecemeal research that has been carried out since. Focusing on energy efficiency in buildings, I organize the review around the concept of credence good: just like that of auto repairs or taxi rides, the quality of energy-efficiency measures is never fully revealed to the buyer; as a result, it is subject tomultiple information asymmetries. My first contribution is to distinguish symmetric-information problems from information asymmetries. The former arise when information is either incomplete or imperfect, but equally shared by contracting parties; as non-market failures, these can be addressed by technological progress and insurance markets. My second contribution is to give structure to the information asymmetries associated with energy efficiency by disentangling screening, signalling, moral hazard and price discrimination within a variety of contractual relationships involving buyers and sellers, owners and renters, borrowers and lenders, and regulators and policy stakeholders. I find evidence of information asymmetries to be compelling in utility-included rental contracts, unclear in home sales and rentals, and scarce in retrofit contracting and financing. I conclude by discussing the intricacies between informational and behavioural problems in energy-efficiency decisions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Efforts to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the United States have led to widespread interest in energy-efficient retrofits in the residential sector. Weatherization retrofits, such as air sealing and insulation, lower residential energy consumption, resulting in reduced fuel and electricity-related emissions, improved ambient air quality, and avoided climate and health impacts. However, retrofits without adequate ventilation may worsen indoor air quality (IAQ) and lead to adverse health effects and costs that offset anticipated economic benefits. Building energy management and climate action plans often omit these potential consequences. This study presents a novel framework that quantifies health and energy costs and benefits related to residential energy-efficient retrofits. Energy savings from reduced consumption were estimated using historical energy prices. Reductions in ambient emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) precursors were translated to avoided health impacts using health damage functions. Indoor PM2.5-related health impacts were estimated by applying PM2.5 concentration-response functions to changes in IAQ. Health impacts were monetized using health impact assessment techniques and compared to retrofit-related savings. For a modeled gas-heated midrise multifamily building in Boston, MA, weatherization retrofits without ventilation or filtration retrofits led to household health costs that far exceeded energy savings and population-level health savings, given increases in indoor PM2.5 concentrations (3.1 mu g/m(3) and 20.4 mu g/m(3) for standard and high-performance retrofits, respectively). In contrast, weatherization coupled with ventilation and filtration retrofits resulted in large savings. Overall, this study reinforces the need to quantify residential health impacts in assessments of energy-efficient retrofits.

AB  - The main function of building envelope is to protect people who live in the building from climatic effects by providing a comfortable microclimate and lighting in the house. Most residential multi-apartment buildings in the Russian Federation were built before mid-1990s with low energy efficiency and, often, low quality. The situation is aggravated by the lack of timely repair, which adversely affects the performance of these buildings. The sphere of individual housing construction also lacks of quality control at all stages of the life cycle of a building. Builders ignore important features of the building design, or the construction works are carried out by unqualified workers, without sufficient quality control. This results in increased energy consumption during the operation of the building, compromised microclimate in the house, violation of environmental requirements, and, in the absence of timely repairs, loss of the bearing capacity of the structural elements of the building. Important areas of development in the field of housing construction are to energy efficiency, improvement of the system of operation and maintenance of buildings, transparency in the operational performance of buildings for owners and investors. To obtain such benefits, it is necessary to develop a strategy for implementation of intelligent technologies and smart engineering systems to improve energy efficiency, automate operational processes and create an 'intelligent' profile of a building. The article presents a study of energy efficiency of buildings and justifies smart management of real estate objects, in order to save resources and timely respond to the decline in their operational qualities. In the modern conditions of market economy, when most of the housing stock is privately owned, it is necessary to create a modern economic and organizational mechanism for overhauls, reconstruction and modernization of building with the use of BIM technologies. The result of the overhaul and reconstruction works is the restoration and improvement of the operational characteristics of buildings. An overhaul or a reconstruction is advisable if the technical condition of the building has been compromised and effective operation and maintenance are impossible. The proposed methodological and practical recommendations aim at implementing the organizational and economic mechanism for managing the quality of overhauls, reconstruction and modernization of real estate objects, meet the emerging need for developing practical measures to revitalize the activities in the housing market and to improve the quality life of the population.

AB  - The consensus in the academic literature is that energy efficiency is associated with transaction value premiums, but it is not clear to what extent property appraisers take account of this. We decompose external appraisals of rental housing by international valuation firms in England and the Netherlands in two waves, keeping the samples of valued homes constant between these years. We find a notable change in the behavior of external property appraisers. In England, energy performance does not impact assessed values in 2012, while estimation results for 2015 show a significant discount in assessed values for D-, E- and F- relative to C-labeled dwellings. For the Netherlands, we do not observe a significant relationship between energy efficiency and assessed values in 2010, but in 2015 we find that more energy efficiency leads to higher external valuations.

AB  - Assessment regarding the impact of Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) on the residential market is largely inconclusive; while the majority of hedonic analyses have found EPC ratings to be correlated with prices, opinion-based research has found a negligible impact on prices and other marketing variables. Using the opinion of qualified real estate agents, this paper explores whether, in Spain, EPC labels play any role in housing marketing, as well as the policy changes required to foster efficient dwellings. The results reveal a large misunderstanding of the EPC labels, since they are seen as a global home-quality indicator, while their impact on residential marketing is quite poor. Apparently, both supply and demand place a small interest in energy performance, although it is slightly larger for sellers/buyers in relation to lenders/tenants. In any case, EPC labels are far from blurring the energy information asymmetry, since most of the buyers/tenants are informed of the EPC rating after having selected their home. Overall, the EPC scheme has a poor reputation exacerbated by inaccuracies, unintelligible units to express the financial and environmental implications of energy efficiency, and an apparent weak supervision. These findings stress the need to improve the scheme; in doing so, realtors suggest the need for some companion policies.

AB  - Reduction of energy use in buildings is an important measure to achieve climate changes of mitigation. It is essential to minimize heat losses when designing energy efficient buildings. For energy efficient building in a cold climate, a large part of the space heating demand is caused by transmission losses through the building envelope. In compliance with the today's trend of designing sustainable and energy-saving architecture, it is necessary firstly to solve the factors influencing the energy balance. This year the subsidy for houses has been valued at sic 8,000. The condition is that the building is classified in the energy class A0 according to the Energy Performance Act. Energy class A0 characterizes nearly zero energy buildings. The main concern is for the public to become interested in such buildings. The subsidy is designed to reward and promote those buildings that their heat and technical characteristics and modern technical equipment that meet energy class. In addition to a good plan to raise the profile of such buildings, there has been a lot of speculation to help make buildings in energy class A0. They are mainly owners of family houses where there is no gasification and are forced to have electricity as a source of heat and hot water. Electricity has a high primary energy factor, which means that buildings do not have to be approved.

When thinking of an ideal city the management of all these factors plays an important role in sustainability. Searching a magical solution to all these problems in this dynamic structure is not realistic, but some novel approaches like using the greenery (plants and microalgae) as bioactive elements adapted throughout the urban environment especially in the form of living facades on the buildings is getting more attention with regards to their eco-friendly potential. Bioactive facades can create a positive impact on managing some important parameters like thermal comfort, energy efficiency, wastewater recycle, CO2 capture and real estate price increase in microscale focusing on a single building aswell as global warming, pollution control, urban heat islands, social wealth and sustainable future in macroscale focusing on a big city. The aim of this review will be the key parameters for an efficient bioactive facade with regards to pros and cons, challenges and future. The review will cover the background of using plants as living walls or green walls and then will focus on the microalgae and photobioreactor adapted buildings.

TI  - The psychology of energy efficiency labels: Trust, involvement, and attitudes towards energy performance certificates in Ireland
AU  - Schuitema, G

AU  - Denny, E
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) aim to inform owners, occupiers, tenants, real estate agents and other relevant groups about the energy efficiency of buildings. Although house buyers and renters often recognize these certificates, they often do not use them. One explanation for this is lack of trust in these certificates. This paper presents the results of an online survey (n = 354), in which the role of perceived source credibility, trust in the certificate and people's involvement in energy efficiency was studied on renters' attitudes towards EPCs in Ireland, so-called BER labels. The results showed that trust is a key determinant for attitudes to EPCs, i.e., attitudes to EPCs become more positive when people trust them. However, how trust is used for the formation of attitudes depends on cognitive involvement (i.e., referring to information processing activities and the achievement of idealization states) and affective involvement (referring to feelings and achievements of certain emotional states). These two types of involvement moderate the effect of trust on attitudes to EPCs in different ways: high-cognitive involvement amplifies the effect of trust on attitudes, whereas high-affective involvement suppresses the effect of trust on attitudes. This has important theoretical implications, as both are often measured together. Equally important are the policy implications: we conclude that if trust levels are relatively high, policies focusing on increasing cognitive involvement are more likely to be effective, whereas if trust in EPCs is low, policy strategies should aim to enhance affective involvement.

AB  - Space heating cost allocation according to actual consumption can be one possible motivating factor for saving energy in residential and other buildings. As a consequence of the exclusion of a certain number of users in collective housing units from the central heating supply system in the city of Skopje, the problem of heating cost allocation and collection of the fixed part of the heat energy payment has arosen. The subject of the analysis in this study was the heat transfer in buildings, with the main focus on the issue of heat transfer rate between residential units with different internal temperatures, such as from heated to unheated or partly heated apartments in collective building objects. The purpose of the analysis was to assess the mutual energy interaction between the completely or partially excluded apartments from the central heating system and the adjacent apartments connected to the central heating system. This is done by simulating the thermal characteristics of typical buildings that are representatives of new (insulated) and old (un-insulated) buildings. For the simulation purposes, the external average daily and monthly temperatures were obtained based on the perennial outdoor temperatures measured in Skopje and additional series of input data that are characteristic for the city were used. For the value of the internal temperature in the dwellings the value for the standard internal design temperatures are predefined. As results of the simulation, values were obtained for the annual heat gains (in kWh/year) and the specific heat gains (in kWh/m(2)year) of the excluded apartments from the system of central heating through the enclosures (internal walls, ceiling and floor) of the adjacent apartments that are connected to the system for central heating and vertical hot water pipelines for an isolated and nonisolated buildings. In order to obtain a clearer picture, in the study are considered different configurations and positions of apartments in the building. As an indicator for each considered apartment, the ratio of the received thermal energy of the disconnected apartment to the required energy for its heating is calculated. Based on the obtained results, appropriate conclusions were drawn regarding the reduction of the necessary energy for heating of the excluded apartments, as a consequence of the thermal gains through the walls of the neighboring apartments that are connected to the heating system.

AB  - A data center cooling system consists of a hierarchy of systems with dedicated control algorithms dictating their operational states. There exists a wide range in spatial and temporal parameter space in an ensemble of non-linear dynamic systems, each executing a control task, while the global objective is to drive the overall system to an optimum operating condition i e minimum total operational power at desired rack inlet temperatures. Certainly, it is beneficial in optimizing workload migration at temporal scales but, solving the instability of the cooling systems operating at design points helps in understanding the whole system and make predictions to have better control strategies. Several techniques are available to realistically capture and make predictions. Data driven modelling/Machine learning is one such method that is less expensive in terms of cost and time compared to other methods like validated CFD simulation/experimental setup.
The objective of this study is to develop a control framework based on predictions made using machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to operate multiple Computer Room Air Conditioning Units (CRAC) or simply Air-Cooling Units (ACU) in a hot-aisle contained raised floor datacenter. This paper focuses on the methodology of gathering training datasets from numerous CFD simulations (Scenarios) to train the ANN model and make predictions with minimal error.
Each rack has a percentage of influence (zones) based on the placement of ACUs and their airflow behavior. These zones are mapped using steady state CFD simulation considering maximum CPU utilization and cooling provisioning. Using this map, ITE racks are targeted and given varying workload to force the corresponding ACU that is responsible for provisioning, to operate at set points. Number of such scenarios are simulated using the same CFD model with fixed bounds and constraints. Using large samples of data collected from CFD results, the ANN is trained to predict values that correspond to the activation of the desired ACU. Such efficient control network would minimize excessive cooling. The validated prediction points are used to model a control framework for the cooling system to quickly reach the operating point. These models can be used in real-time data centers provided; the training data is based on in-house sensor values.

T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - High-density buildings can benefit city sustainability by reducing expansion into biodiverse and often public natural ecosystems, reducing travel-time to work-and-play and improving energy efficiency. However, city densification can also remove vegetation which provides ecosystem services that enhance resident's wellbeing. Some architects design shared landscapes on and around large-scale buildings which are excludable to the public, like private gardens, but can be rivalrous between residents, like parks. This potentially mitigates public vegetation and subsequent ecosystem service loss. However, little evidence exists on whether condominium unit buyers pay more for shared landscapes. To address this knowledge gap, we used the hedonic pricing method to explain condominium unit resale value with unbuilt and vegetated space, accounting for other price determinants, spatial and temporal random effects using a robust regression. Leaf area above 184 m(2) and unbuilt area (condominium estate area minus the building footprint) above 62.3 m(2) per person had significant positive effects on condominium unit selling price. This provides evidence that economic returns can be gained by having vegetation in accessible landscapes on and around buildings, should they be provided above a certain quantity. When supplied at more abundant quantities condominium estate vegetation also had a bigger effect than nearby managed parks, suggesting condominium unit buyers see more economic value in having nearer snore private vegetation. Planners and building developers should consider these effects when deciding whether to encourage vegetated landscapes at condominium estates, alongside how vegetation can provide other monetary and nonmonetary ecosystem services.

AB  - Building performance simulation [BPS] tools are important in all design stages. However, barriers such as time, resources, and expertise inhibit their use in the early design stages. This study aims to develop, as part of decision -support framework, metamodels to assess the thermal discomfort in a naturally ventilated Brazilian low-cost house during early design. The metamodels predict the degree -hours of discomfort by heat and/or by cold as a function of design parameters for three Brazilian cities: Curitiba, Sao Paulo, and Manaus. The key design parameters, related with passive design strategies, are building orientation, shading devices position and dimensions, thermal properties of the walls and roof, window-to-wall ratio, and effective window ventilation area. The method consists of three main stages: (i) baseline model development; (ii) Monte Carlo simulation; (iii) multivariate regression. Overall, the metamodels showed R-2 values higher than 0.95 for all climates, except the ones predicting discomfort by heat for Curitiba (R-2 =0.61) and Sao Paulo (R-2 =0.75). The proposed metamodels can quickly and accurately assess the thermal performance of naturally ventilated low-cost houses. They can be used to guide professionals during the early design stages, and for educational purposes in building design pedagogy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB  - Housing conditions are addressed by climate policy in retrofitting buildings and by social policy in providing affordable and adequate housing. Aim This paper illustrates intersections between both policy spheres in Austria and argues that disjunct policies undermine efforts at alleviating energy poverty. We identify conditions under which housing in Austria may lead to reduction in carbon emissions and inequality. Methods A concurrent triangulation design combines secondary data analysis, semi-structured expert interviews, and an in-depth analysis of legal documents. Results Energy poor and generally poor similarly live in low-quality and inefficient housing. Climate and social policy suffer from fragmented jurisdictions lacking inter-sectoral integration and do not accurately target the energy poor. Structural investments and the provision of affordable, adequate housing conflict due to the tenant/landlord dilemma. Implications Socio-economic conditions and housing market structures need to be incorporated in policy design. Inter-ministerial collaboration may mainstream the integration of climate and social policy.

Using a sample of 876,000 single-family homes in the Netherlands, we examine the impact of EPC adoption on the speed of sale. Our results indicate that energy-rated homes sell faster than non-energy-rated homes, an effect that varies by 7-12 percent depending on model specifications and increases when positive (green) ratings are granted. The information conveyed by these certificates reduces the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers, which helps to reduce the uncertainty of quality. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In the year 2017, about 89% of the total energy consumed in the US was produced using non-renewable energy sources, and about 43% of tenant households were cost burdened. Local governments are in a unique position to facilitate green affordable housing, that could reduce cost burdens, environmental degradation, and environmental injustice. Nonetheless, limited studies have made progress on the costs and benefits of green affordable housing, to guide decision-making, particularly in small communities. This study investigates density bonus options for green affordable housing by analyzing construction costs, transaction prices, and spillover effects of green certifications and affordable housing units. The authors employ pooled cross-sectional construction cost and price data from 422 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) projects and 11,016 Multiple Listing Service (MLS) transactions in Virginia. Using hedonic regression analyses controlling for mediating factors, the study finds that the new construction of market-rate green certified houses is associated with small upfront costs, but large and statistically significant price premiums. In addition, the construction of market-rate green certified houses has large and statistically significant spillover effects on existing non-certified houses. Existing non-certified affordable housing units show small and often insignificant negative price impacts on the transaction prices of surrounding properties. The study concludes that the magnitude of social benefits associated with green building justifies the local provision of voluntary programs for green affordable housing, where housing is expensive relative to its basic cost of production.

T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - We investigate the notion of capitalizing on investments in energy, water and gas efficiency within the context of affordable rental housing subsidy schemes; how associated utility savings offer a means to deliver policy designed to mitigate for issues of split-incentives. An Australian case study representing a typical affordable housing development is analyzed for two scenarios - a 'Business as usual' and 'Green-certified' case. Over a 10-year rental tenancy, operational utility efficiencies, achieved through green building principles are modelled to reduce total housing costs by 1.7-3.8% (AUD $5-18 per week), for one- and four-person households, respectively. Over the building lifecycle, the net present value of improvements are forecasted to be positive, signalling favourable support for policy interventions. The findings provide evidence to support a broader notion of 'housing assistance' to one that includes improved standards on residential utility efficiency. We present three policy options on how to deliver these benefits to stakeholders.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether energy-efficient green buildings tend to provide net lease structures over gross lease ones. It then considers whether owners benefit by trading away operational savings in a net lease structure. Design/methodology/approach Empirical models of office leasing transactions in Sydney, Australia, with wider transferability supported by analysis of office rent data in the USA. Findings Labeled green buildings are approximately four to five times more likely than non-labeled buildings to use a net lease structure. However, despite receiving operational savings, tenants in net leases pay higher total occupancy costs (TOC), benefiting owners. On average, the increase in TOC paid by tenants in a net lease is equal to or greater than savings attributed to an eco-labeled building. Originality/value The principal-agent market inefficiency, or "split incentive," is a widely cited barrier to private investment in energy-efficient building technology. Here, a uniquely broad look at rental cash flows suggests its role as a barrier is exaggerated.

AB  - Sustainable and energy efficient (SEE) attributes in the housing market have become a focus in Canada. Similarly, understanding the consumer's decision-making process of this high-involvement ethical product has become a burgeoning area for researchers. This study describes the development of the subject, highlighting the nature of the ethical decision-making process and how it relates to this known intention-behaviour gap. An observation, followed by two studies consisting of in-depth interviews with real estate agents and sales representatives (n = 15) and home purchasers/consumers (n = 15), were conducted. Transcriptions were analysed qualitatively with NVivo Pro 12 software (NVivo Pro 12, QSR International Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia). Inductive thematic analysis revealed two main driving themes: information and trust in seller/realtor. Attribute investment return uncertainty was identified as a theme that affects the strength of the relationship between purchase intention and behaviour, whereas the trust in seller/realtor speaks to how and why this effect occurs. The findings present relationships among the driving factors that were identified by realtors and consumers in the SEE housing market, as well as barriers (investment return uncertainty) that prevent consumers from purchasing high-involvement ethical products.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relation between energy factor markets, leasing structures, and the transaction prices of office buildings in the U.S. We employ a large sample of 15,133 office building transactions between 2001 and 2010. In addition to building characteristics, we also include information on the operating expenses, net operating income, and market capitalization rates at sale to estimate an asset-pricing model for commercial office real estate assets. A further set of important controls in our analysis is the forward/futures contract prices for electricity and natural gas. We also include weather metrics for each building's location and sale date. Our final set of controls includes information on the dominant contractual leasing structure of the buildings. Our empirical results suggest that Energy Star labels do not explain additional variance in property prices once the key asset-pricing factors of expenses, income and market capitalization rates are included. By contrast, energy-factor market prices, the shape of the energy forward price curves, and weather metrics are consistently significant determinants of office building transaction prices, suggesting that commercial office building prices are exposed to shocks in these markets.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Passive House buildings with an annual energy demand of less than 15 kWh/m(2)a (i.e. kWh/m(2) per annum) can help Canada and other countries achieve thermal comfort with minimum energy use and carbon footprint through meticulous design and selection of highly efficient building envelope elements and appliances. Shipping container based passive houses can reduce the cost of passive house construction and also promote recycling. In this paper, a passive house built using shipping containers, originally designed for Victoria, BC, Canada, is analyzed using Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) software in different climactic zones of Canada. The locations under consideration are: Halifax (Cool-Temperate), Toronto (Cold-Temperate), Edmonton (Cold), and Yellowknife (Arctic-Climate). This paper critically examines the energy demand changes in various climate zones and make necessary modifications to the design to achieve passive house energy performance requirements in selected climates. Results show that with modified designs shipping container passive houses can meet passive house requirements, except in the Arctic-Climate of Yellowknife.

A process evaluation of the specific policy design focussing on potential sources of policy failure is provided. Drawing upon a database of all EPCs registered for offices in London, preliminary empirical evidence is presented on policy outcomes post-announcement and pre-implementation period. The extent to which EPC G and F rated office buildings in London have improved their EPC rating in anticipation of the introduction of the policy between 2011 until 2017 is analysed. It is found that a maximum of 0.65% of the properties affected by the introduction of minimum standards had modifications that could have been triggered by the policy intervention in the period prior to policy implementation.

T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Energy performance certificates (EPCs) were introduced to give property buyers better information about the energy efficiency of dwellings and provide incentives to make energy-efficient investments. Previous studies on the effect of EPCs on property value have yielded divergent results, with some studies finding that energy labels affect property values, but others finding that energy labels have little or no effect. The present paper takes the analysis one step further. Using data on energy prices in combination with transaction data from Oslo, we conclude that not only the energy label, but also the energy performance of dwellings in general, has little to no effect on transaction prices. This result is in line with the inferences of several survey studies, which indicate that when people buy a dwelling, they pay considerably less attention to its energy performance compared with other factors, such as the location, neighborhood, size, garden, and the number of bedrooms.

T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - In India, 46 million, mostly rural, households lack access to electricity - over 50% of those are in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. While India has set an aggressive goal of extending the grid to all households by 2019, grid extension does not necessarily imply reliable electricity access. Indian utilities face a financial disincentive to supplying reliable electricity in rural areas because of subsidized tariffs and low consumer willingness-to-pay. Tariff subsidies for full household electrification in these states would be about Rs 15,000 Cr per year, which is two-times the existing subsidies and equivalent to 20-30% of their annual utility revenues. We find that superefficient lamps, TVs, and fans can reduce the energy consumption of a rural household by over 70% cost-effectively, resulting in a net reduction in the total subsidy burden. Reduced consumption offers an opportunity to raise consumer tariffs while ensuring consumers' monthly electricity bills reduced. We also argue that superefficient appliances make consumer-side storage cost-effective, leading to greater consumer willingness-to-pay. We recommend adoption of super-efficient appliances as part of the electricity access initiative in India, and electricity service based tariff setting as the next policy steps towards providing a reliable and sustainable electricity access.

T2  - MAUERWERK
AB  - In recent decades, energy efficiency has been the priority for masonry buildings in order to keep up with ever more stringent requirements. For the evaluation of the sustainability of building solutions, however, the embodied energy to produce a building and finally to dispose of it at the end of its lifecycle are also important. The energy used for the disposal of a building and the processing of the residues are also important for the overall energy balance since the handling of natural resources is increasingly the centre point of thought and action. A research team at the Chair of Structural Design of TU Dresden has thus been working since 2012 on demountable solutions in masonry, which can be dismantled at the end of a building lifetime and sorted for recycling, which fully complies with the requirement for the reduction of rubbish and waste products. The high precision of block production today permits us to omit the levelling effect of mortar and to build dry buildings in the future, i.e. to do without the bonding principle. The associated strength reductions can be suffered without problems. The appropriate basics of such a dry building method have been researched in a collaboration between the ILEK in Stuttgart and the Xella Technologie- und Forschungsgesellschaft mbH in Emstal. In this research project with the abbreviation "REMOMAB", the basics of an energy-efficient dry building method suitable for recycling were collected and made available for practical application. In a follow-up project, these basics are being implemented and tested on an experimental building. Cost aspects are also to be taken into account and if possible, construction solutions available on the market will be used - modified if necessary. Another aim is for the first time to dismantle such a building and to rebuild it at another location. This is intended to demonstrate that a reuse is possible after dismantling and such a building method can react to changing demands in the housing market.

T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Interventions for sustainability attainment in affordable housing have received increasing attention from policy makers globally. However, policy-makers' interventions for sustainable affordable housing markets can be inefficient and even counterproductive. As such, among the diverse interventions available, a vital question is what are the potential efficient interventions? To address this question, the views of affordable housing experts (also knowledgeable in sustainable housing) around the world were solicited via a questionnaire survey to identify critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable affordable housing. Relative significance analysis of the data led to the identification of 13 CSFs. Furthermore, agreement analysis revealed that there is no good agreement between respondents from the academic sector and those from the industrial sector on the ranking of the 13 CSFs. Moreover, through factor analysis, the CSFs were grouped into four underlying components: developer's enabling CSFs; household-demand enabling CSFs; mixed land use CSFs; land use planning CSFs. The research findings seek to inform policy-makers on the CSFs for efficient resource utilization for sustainable affordable housing market. Future study would establish a relationship between the CSFs and success criteria for sustainable affordable housing.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of the Real Estate Market in a Social Perspective: Results from the Turin's (Italy) Experience
AU  - Curto, R

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In Italy, it has always been difficult to collect reliable data on real estate given the opacity of the information available. Keeping into consideration the actual availability of data and information, the possibility to have a structure for permanently monitoring and analysing the real estate market is fundamental. Focusing on developing and disseminating knowledge related to practices in this context, in this paper the Turin's (Northern Italy) experience is presented, through the Real Estate Market Observatory (TREMO): This structure is based on a data-warehouse, implemented over time, with databases that lead to historic price observations of the residential market. The data warehouse is the basis for investigating methodologies and analyses, assuming the spatial requisites of the data and its georeferencing as the main discriminant in choosing among descriptive statistics, multi-varied or spatial analysis methods. In twenty years, several studies have been developed, allowing us not only to explore the applicability of models and operative modalities, but also to obtain results with a high potential impact under a social viewpoint. In this paper, the methodologies developed for implementing the monitoring structure are presented, specifically the quality process and computerized analysis procedures, followed by some representative research experiences with reference to aims, models and results.

AB  - Students are often described as an under-reported and under-supported group of the population falling into energy poverty. Although the main drivers of energy poverty are well documented, up to this date little attention is given to housing tenure as a cause of energy poverty. This study aims to support the understanding of the motivations and barriers faced by property owners that rent accommodation to students for making energy efficiency improvements to their rented properties. With this understanding recommendations for alleviating energy poverty experienced by students living in the private rented sector can be formulated. The research conducted is based on qualitative methods; focus group discussions and interviews. Data were collected from almost 30 student landlords in seven EU countries between October 2017 and January 2018. Findings show that grants and financial incentives are key for the questioned proprietors to move to energy efficiency improvements of their property but bureaucracy burdens are a major barrier for moving forward with them. In addition, the need for stronger information campaigns on energy efficiency issues is revealed. Eventually, a number of financial, consumer protection, energy efficiency and informational measures for alleviating energy poverty experienced by students living in private rented accommodation are proposed.

T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Credible estimates of energy savings from green buildings are critical for policy makers to examine the cost and benefit of various incentives intended to encourage commercial buildings to go green (e.g. expedited construction permits, government grants, and property tax incentives). Yet, data limitations have hindered reliable estimations. Filling this gap, this study uses a large panel dataset on energy consumption for commercial buildings in Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona. By tracking building occupants' monthly energy consumption before and after the building's certification as an Energy Star building, we provide new estimates of the environmental gains from private investment in green real estate. Results show that for occupants that occupy space in a certified building in both the pre-certification and post-certification periods, occupants in Energy Star buildings consume 8% less energy. This empirically robust estimate of potential benefit from green-certification provides a quantifiable benchmark against which green-promoting policies can be measured. We also document evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects. Energy savings differ by the building's initial certification points and the building's baseline energy consumption. These results are useful for policy makers to identify targets for green certification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Valorisation of energy services: essay on the value addition due to renewable energy
AU  - Krozer, Y
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The shift from fossil fuels and traditional renewable energy to costlier modern renewable energy based on geothermal wind and solar resources is explained.Statistical data collected from 14 countries with a population greater than 100 million inhabitants was used, where the EU is considered as a country. The period from 1990 to 2015 is covered, however divided in two parts, 1990-2005 when conditions were not favourable for renewable energy because the price of fossil fuels and policy support for renewable energy were low, and 2005-2015 when these conditions improved.Theoretical analyses show that the high price of fossil fuels, policy support and cost-effective technologies can explain the fast growth of modern renewable energy during 2005-2015; however, they only partially account for its slower growth during 1990-2005. An additional explanation might be that the innovators generate qualities due to renewable energy use, which are expressed on the markets as value addition of energy services. The statistical analysis of energy services during 1990-2005 shows that the European Union (EU) led in renewable energy compared to the United States (US), Japan and other countries, which was driven by the social initiatives that fostered new firms in the electricity and gas business. A statistical analysis of energy services in the US and EU during 2005-2015 reveals that their value added has grown on an annual average of 2.0% and 2.8%, respectively, which denotes an annual increase of 3 billion and 6 billion US dollars in the 2005 value (USD2005). This valorisation of energy services has invoked further innovations in distributed energy systems and energy storage. A further statistical analysis of the 14 largest countries by population confirms a valorisation of energy services due to modern renewable energy where the emission reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a side-effect. Extrapolation of the averagegrowth rates from the period 1990 to 2015 to the period 2015 to 2040, without any change but a substitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy, demonstrates that global income would grow fourfold and energy consumption twofold along with a 100 times larger modern renewable energy and CO2 reduction to 46% of the 2015 level. When those average growth rates of renewable energy decrease linear to 25%in 2040, the global modern renewable energy grows tenfold and CO2 reduces to 82% of the 2015 level.The implication of this statistical study on large countries shows that higher value energy services for households are often based on distributed renewable energy and that such an addition of value generates a CO2 emission reduction as a side effect which can be enhanced by pricing CO2 or obstructed by policy support for the vested interests. This study indicated that the valorisation of energy services will generate a growth of income, energy consumption and renewable energy along with a far-reaching emission reduction of CO2 if policies do foster sustainable innovations.

TI  - The emergence of data centres as an innovative alternative property sector
AU  - Marzuki, MJ
AU  - Newell, G
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose - As one of the increasingly important alternative property sectors, data centres are a technology-focused property sector that is taking advantage of the growing investment intensity in technology-related infrastructure, against the backdrop of constant innovation and advancement in technology. The purpose of this paper is to assess the preliminary risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification benefits of data centre Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the USA, Australia and Singapore. The strategic implications going forward for data centres as an innovative property sector in the property investment space are also highlighted.
Design/methodology/approach - Using monthly total returns, the average annual return, annual risk, risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification benefits of data centre REITs in the USA, Australia and Singapore over 2016-2018 are assessed. Optimal asset allocation analysis is performed to investigate the value-added role of data centre REITs in a mixed-asset portfolio.
Findings - Data centre REITs delivered strong average annual return performance, outperforming the composite REITs in all three markets. This also sees data centre REITs being riskier than the overall REIT sector due to the non-traditional and maturing status of the data centre property sector. On a risk-adjusted basis, competitive performance was recorded for data centre REITs, with data centre REITs in the USA and Singapore outperforming their respective composite REITs. This performance is also delivered with significant portfolio diversification benefits with the stock market, resulting in data centre REITs contributing to the US mixed-asset portfolios across a diverse risk spectrum.
Practical implications - Institutional investors are now giving increased emphasis to alternative property sectors with better risk-return trade-offs. Improved performance and diversification benefits are achieved by supplementing existing property portfolios with non-traditional property sectors with counter-cyclical risk-return profiles, one of which is the data centre property sector. This sees data centres as an important alternative property sector, having technology-based drivers and being recognised as having a clear path towards institutionalisation with the major investors in the near future.
Originality/value - This paper is the first published empirical research analysis that specifically assessed the preliminary performance and diversification benefits of data centre REITs in the USA, Australia and Singapore. This research enables empirically validated, more informed and practical property investment decision making by institutional investors regarding the future strategic role of the data centre property sector as an innovative sector in the institutional property investment space.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Much research exists measuring income and valuation premiums to owners and operators of environmentally-certified real estate, yet little work examines the financial impact to the space users, outside of decreased utility costs. Such implications for space users are of great importance, as tenant businesses may be unwilling or unable to pay a rental rate premium for environmentally-certified space if there is not an associated user benefit. Under a simple yet rigorous fixed effects model with geographic clustering, we study the relationship between environmentally-certified retail space and location specific financial performance. Examining retail bank branches, we find that LEED certified spaces are associated with above average deposit levels, while Energy Star-certified branches offer inconsistent results. These results are tested in an event study which validates the findings, and indicates that the benefits of LEED extend years past initial certification, evidencing lasting income-related benefits. Finally, bank- and branch-specific subsample analyses confirm these results while controlling for idiosyncratic characteristics. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The impact of policy on residential energy consumption
AU  - Aydin, E

T2  - ENERGY
AB  - Due to the growing concerns about global climate change and energy dependence, many countries have introduced regulations targeting the energy efficiency of the residential sector. However, whether these policies have been effective in reducing the total residential consumption of energy is still unclear. In this paper, we analyze the impact of residential energy efficiency policies on household energy consumption across Europe for the period 1980-2016. We examine the electricity and non-electricity energy consumption separately, as these are generally used for different purposes (appliances and heating) by households and are subject to different energy efficiency policies. We focus on two distinct types of regulations mandatory energy efficiency labels for household appliances and building standards. After controlling for county-specific effects and changes in income, energy prices, demography and climate conditions over our sample period, our results offer compelling evidence that both the energy labeling requirements for appliances and the stricter building codes lead up to lower residential energy consumption. According to our estimation results, we should expect a 0.24% reduction in residential electricity use after governments introduce a mandatory disclosure of energy labels for an appliance group that represent ten percent of households' electricity use. Similarly, given that U-values proxy the thermal quality of the new dwellings, we find that a 0.1 unit decrease in the U-value requirement triggers a lasting 0.28% annual decrease in residential non-electricity energy consumption. These results can help policymakers to shape future regulations targeted on reducing our energy use in the years to come. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - GOSPODARKA NARODOWA
AB  - Despite the increasing popularity of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models in energy-economy-environment analyses, Polish data still provide a modest disaggregation of energy-related sectors. Hence, CGE modellers need to disaggregate corresponding products and industries on their own - to not only obtain more detailed insights, but also avoid the problem of an "aggregation bias". The aim of this paper is to test for such a bias in Poland's case using a small open economy, CGE model called GEMPOL, with an in-house split of energy sectors. Three alternative versions of the model are calibrated and solved. The first version includes energy sectors in their original breakdown. The second version includes their in-house split, with particular values of Armington elasticities derived directly from "parent" sectors. In the third version, Armington elasticities are increased in order to reflect the higher degree of international competition for smaller sub-products. Through a simulation shock, imposed under comparative-statics mode, an exogenous energy efficiency improvement is modelled. Finally, the results obtained from all the variants of the model are compared. It turns out that the simulation results produced by both aggregations and all three specifications of the model are similar from the macroeconomic perspective, but they vary significantly between different aggregations at the sectoral level.

AB  - Monitoring electricity consumption has a key role in reducing energy consumption. This monitoring can be frequent (several times per week) or continuous. Recent studies showed that such monitoring can reduce residential energy consumption by as much as 15%. The development of energy management systems in the monitoring systems and intelligent energy meters have been going for a while. In this paper, we will present a new electricity monitoring device called "E-ring". E-ring is a non-invasive tool mainly made from a current transformer clamp meter that clamps to the main electricity cables of the user's home and measures the electrical consumption and sends the measured data to an online server and then makes it accessible from the user's mobile phone using a specially-developed mobile application. It has many advantages such as low data rate, low price, and real-time access to the consumption data and simultaneously calculate the estimated price for the household/industrial electricity bill with a tolerance of around 2%.

AB  - Considering the high share of residential buildings in the total energy use in Sweden, having the ambitious national energy and climate goals in mind, the real estate sector and its issues have been under a lot of attention during the past few decades. The Swedish real estate sector has often been identified with its ambitious public housing program during the record years (1960-1974). This was at the time the largest housing program per capita in the world where more than a million apartments were built in a nation with a population of 8 million. These apartments once being the pride of a nation, are facing a lot of problems today, ranging from vacancy and unacceptable physical condition to very poor energy performance. These buildings at the verge of their service/economic life are in need of extensive maintenance and renovation measures. Considering the technological development today, the problem with maintenance and renovation remains to be the financial constraints. These are what makes planning for maintenance and renovation complicated and cost inefficient. Although there are tools that can help property managers with maintenance and renovation planning, they all fail to address the complexity of the decision-making process in a multi-objective criteria under financial and time constraints. In this study, the focus is on the life cycle economy of the building components subject to energy performance improvements during renovation. A systematic approach has been proposed that can be used to budget and plan renovation with regard to energy efficiency under budget constraints. This approach utilizes a modified condition/deterioration model of the method Schroeder to simulate the maintenance effect on the condition state of building components in order to obtain the cost-optimal maintenance regime under given restrictions. This methodology can be used to compare the cost effectiveness of different energy-renovation scenarios and determine the optimal renovation plan for a single or a combination of buildings with regard to owners' objectives and existing constraints. The results from this study illustrates how prioritizing action plans can affect the life cycle costs of building components.

AB  - Construction industry is and has always been a flourishing industry in the whole world. Today, with the global development especially in technology, real estate construction is growing more than ever and is continuously using new techniques and methods. However, cost remains a big challenge specially to developing and under developed countries where people in urban as in rural areas can't afford expensive materials and construction methods to build their own houses with. As a result, companies in the construction industry are highly competing, and several researches are being held in this field in order to find the best and most cost and energy efficient building materials and techniques. In the first part of this paper, unfired clay bricks samples were prepared using three type of additives: Palm fronds, date pits and limestone, with different percentages. The mechanical properties, illustrated in compressive and flexural strength, were reviewed, to then suggest recommendations as the outcome of the study. It was found that date pits are the most preferable additive to strengthen unfired clay bricks. In the second part, a mechanical simulation for perforated bricks was done in SolidWorks software to analyze the effect of the number of holes and their distribution on the mechanical properties of the brick

AB  - Energy poverty in developed countries is a consequence of the abolition of government intervention in energy prices as well as high energy prices. The aim of this paper is to research quality of measures to combat energy poverty. The implemented methodology included an analysis of measures to combat energy poverty in European countries and analysis and quality of Croatian measures to combat energy poverty. The combat energy poverty can only be carried out with high quality measures while bad measures send the wrong image to customers. While access to energy is one of the ways to combat poverty, high energy price affects a lot of people who cannot pay for it. Furthermore, incentive measures aimed at developing renewable energy sources and energy efficiency requirements increase the energy price. High-income households can invest in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, but low-income households cannot replace the appliances with high energy consumption with those that have lower consumption. Hence, their energy consumption (that is higher than the average) has a significant impact on their economic status and social inclusion. The first research on poverty in the Republic of Croatia was carried out by the World Bank and the Croatian Central Bureau of Statistics in 1998, when 4% very poor households were detected. Newer research resulted with a higher percentage of those who are not able to ensure adequate heating in the coldest months. The results of this research point out that Croatia does not have good measures to combat energy poverty because the measures included a significantly smaller number of households with extremely large funds.

T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - The study aims to identify residence groups that are highly vulnerable to fuel poverty in the urban area of a South Korean city. Thereby, the paper emphasizes that fuel poverty problems occur in different ways according to the social and spatial contexts and thus need a more contextualized policy approach beyond the simplistic criteria of household income and heating cost. To fully capture the meaning of cold homes, an empirical dataset of thermal efficiency of individual dwellings and actual heating in a residential area in Seoul, South Korea is examined along with the tenure type and the ownership attributes. The analyses reveal that the amount of actual heating energy consumption did not show any clear relation with the thermal efficiency of housing or the tenure type. Additionally, considerably inefficient dwellings like old, detached houses are occupied by elderly owners who often lack both the financial capability and intention to properly maintain their properties. The result indicates that people who are living in cold homes are not always confined to poor residents living in rented homes. The study proposes some new types of potential fuel poverty based on the analyses of thermal efficiency and heating patterns by dwellings.

AB  - Energy security, pollution and sustainability are major challenges presently facing the international community, in response to which increasing quantities of renewable energy are to be generated in the urban environment. Consequently, recent years have seen a strong increase in the uptake of solar technologies in the building sector. In this work, the potential of a solar combined heat and power (CHP) system based on an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine is investigated in a domestic setting. Unlike previous studies that focus on the optimisation of the ORC subsystem, this study performs a complete system optimisation considering both the design parameters of the solar collector array and the ORC engine simultaneously. Firstly, we present thermodynamic models of different collectors, including flat-plate and evacuated-tube designs, coupled to a non-recuperative sub-critical ORC architecture that delivers power and hot water by using thermal energy rejected from the engine. Optimisation of the complete system is first conducted, aimed at identifying operating conditions for which the power output is maximised. Then, hourly dynamic simulations of the optimised system configurations are performed to complete the system sizing. Results are presented of: (i) dynamic 3-D simulations of the solar collectors together with a thermal energy storage tank, and (ii) of an optimisation analysis to identify the most suitable working fluids for the ORC engine, in which the configuration and operational constraints of the collector array are considered. The best performing working fluids (R245fa and R1233zd) are then chosen for a whole-system annual simulation in a southern European climate. The system configuration combining an evacuated-tube collector array and an ORC engine is found to be best-suited for electricity prioritisation, delivering an electrical output of 3,605 kWh/year from a 60 m(2) collector array. In addition, the system supplies 13,175 kWh/year in the form of domestic hot water, which is equivalent to more than 6 times the average annual household demand. A brief cost analysis and comparison with photovoltaic (PV) systems is also performed, where despite the lower PV investment cost per kWel, the levelised energy costs of the different systems are found to be similar if the economic value of the thermal output is taken into account. Finally, a discussion of the modelled solar-CHP systems results shows how these could be used for real applications and extended to other locations.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - Real estate is an industry sector with high potential to increase energy efficiency. However, many of the existing green building investment opportunities (GBIO) are not utilized because economic valuation tools are complex and oftentimes difficult to understand. For this reason, we develop a formal, but comprehensible bottom-up model to determine the optimal investment amount from an economic perspective, placing particular emphasis on the descriptive valuation of risk, and point out the applicability of GBIO as insurance against energy price volatility. We also give examples of the model's potential application. Our work shows that considering the insurance effect will increase the optimal investment amount and that certain investment amounts lead to both economic and ecological benefits in properties and property portfolios. Our findings can be used for a comprehensible enhancement of existing valuation methods and tools to reduce the energy efficiency gap (EEG). They constitute a quantitative basis for the adaption of laws to counteract the current underinvestment in the real estate sector.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Most of the operational energy needed by the housing sector is used to compensate energy losses or thermal gains through the building's envelope. As a result, any improvement in the thermal behavior will provide important opportunities to reduce energy consumption. This research analyzes improvements in the thermal envelope in social housing in the Greater Concepcion area in Chile using adaptive thermal comfort models and thermal insulation investments. The objective set out is to evaluate the economic reduction of thermal envelope improvement costs for dwellings, which entails using the adaptive thermal comfort model obtained through monitoring and the surveys applied to the users of social housing in Concepcion (CAS), against the international adaptive thermal comfort models established by the EN 15251: 2007 and ASHRAE 55-2017 standards. Finally, it is concluded that, on having applied the social housing adaptive thermal comfort model (CAS), execution costs are reduced by between 28.8% and 58.2%, reaching a time of comfort in free oscillation similar to that obtained from applying the models of the EN 15251: 2007 (74.2%) and ASHRAE 55-2017 standards (59.9%).

T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on fuel poverty by bringing together the "housing-cost-induced-poverty" definition and the "low-income-high-cost" indicator. Relying on the housing-cost-induced-poverty definition, this paper identifies three "dimensions" of fuel poverty: 1) income-poverty-high-cost; 2) housing-cost induced-poverty-high-cost; and, 3) fuel-cost-induced-poverty-high-cost. After breaking down the underlying structure of the low-income-high-cost framework, this paper proposes an alternative conceptual definition of fuel poverty and puts forward an empirical strategy which can help to identify the households most in need of financial and energy-related support. An application based on energy cost data in England allows us to identify several policy implications following from our proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper describes the progress of the four-year European project Pro-GET-onE currently under implementation. This research and innovation project is based on the assumption that greater efficiency, attractiveness, and marketable renovation can only be achieved through an integrated set of technologies where all the different requirements (energy, structural, functional) are optimally managed. Thus, the project focuses on the unprecedented integration of different technologies to achieve a multi-benefit approach that is provided by a closer integration between energy and non-energy related benefits. The project aims to combine different pre-fabricated elements in a unified and integrated system resulting in a higher performance in terms of energy requirements, structural safety, and social sustainability. The project attempts to achieve this goal through the introduction of innovative solutions for building envelopes to optimally combine the climatic, structural, and functional aspects through a significant architectural transformation and a substantial increase of the real estate value of the buildings. This augmented value obtained through the application of the inteGrated Efficient Technologies (GETs) is extremely important when considering the necessity of creating an innovative and attractive market in the energy renovation of existing buildings towards the target of nearly zero energy buildings (nZEBs).

T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - This paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of renovating single-family houses to Passive House level, as compared to maintaining the existing buildings or renovating to building regulation level. The assessment involved life cycle cost analyses, and concerns the Swedish single-family housing stock constructed between 1961 and 1980, which accounts for about a third of Sweden's two million single-family houses. These houses, now in need of major renovation, are represented in this study by two reference buildings. The results show that Passive House renovations can be cost-effective, but this largely depends on the type of heat generation used in the houses. The most cost-effective individual renovation measure was installing an exhaust air heat pump, and the least cost-effective was installing new windows. In houses using direct electric heating, the Passive House renovation package was the most cost-effective alternative. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Recognition of the negative impacts of fuel poverty, a lack of sufficient energy services in the home, has generated considerable interest in how the phenomenon can best be measured. Subsequently, the most well-known indicators deployed in policy-making, the established 10% indicator and the recent Low Income High Cost (LIHC) indicator, have generated considerable discussion and critique. One facet of the debate that remains unexplored is the effect of a change in indicator upon the spatial distribution of fuel poverty. Using spatial analyses we interrogate sub-regional estimates of the two indicators in England, where the LIHC indicator was first conceived. Three principle findings are discussed, enhancing understanding of the geographic features of fuel poverty as understood by each indicator. Firstly, the reduction in fuel poor households has disproportionately affected areas with lower housing costs. Secondly, there is a higher prevalence of fuel poverty in urban areas. Finally, the condition is more spatially heterogeneous with fewer 'hot-spots' and 'cold-spots'. As a result, each indicator captures different notions of what it means to be fuel poor, representing particular vulnerabilities, losses of wellbeing and injustices. This has implications for the targeting of limited alleviation resources and for alternative national contexts where the LIHC indicator might be deployed.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Adoption of green design and technology in buildings, which can mitigate negative impacts on the environment, has been recognized as a key step towards global sustainable development. In addition to technology development, economic viability plays a pivotal role in stimulating the design, construction and use of green buildings. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent studies on the economic viability of "going green", including cost-benefit analyses from the perspective of building life cycle and from the perspective of major market participants. While "going green" is more likely to be seen as profitable from the building life cycle perspective, economic viability, from the perspective of developers and occupants, remains unclear due to information, behavior and policy factors. Such discrepancy in the results regarding economic viability is one major reason for the "paradox" of the very gradual diffusion of apparently cost-effective green buildings in most economies. We also propose several key topics that merit future research, including more comprehensive evidence about life-cycle costs and benefits of green buildings, the incorporation of ancillary long-term or intangible benefits in the analysis of economic viability for developers and occupants, an investigation on the dynamics of the adoption of green buildings, and institutional arrangements for stimulating green practices in the building sector.

AB  - Iraq suffers from large housing problems. It is estimated that there is a shortage of around one million dwellings, which is equal to one-fourth of the total housing stock in the country. As a part of the solutions, the country needs architectural designs that satisfy three main conditions: enable an increase of the housing production, be affordable and satisfy people's residential requirements. The latter includes, for instance, providing suitable layouts, comfortable environment and the required level of privacy. Within this spectrum, this paper focuses on providing a thermally comfortable indoor environment. The importance of this aspect is raised by the high temperatures in Iraq, the unreliable electricity supply, reducing the running costs and the need to maintain the environment at comfort conditions. The paper explores the courtyard pattern as an approach to achieve a thermally comfortable indoor environment, and studies how courtyards might be adopted within multistory residential buildings in order to reduce the costs and support the housing production. It reports on an extensive literature review that investigates published scientific studies within the last ten years about the thermal efficiency of the courtyard pattern and its design features. To propose design solutions, the paper considered the investigation's results and the main residential buildings criteria and standards. The research results define the courtyard pattern thermal efficiency and demonstrate the importance of adopting the courtyard pattern's design features to provide a thermally comfortable indoor environment. It also proposes two architectural solutions for Iraq that include using courtyards in multistory residential buildings.

AB  - This article presents the issue of electricity consumption for space heating purposes. High share of fossil fuels used for space heating leads to high pollution emission. A solution for this problem may be encouraging customers to use electricity as an energy carrier for space heating, by proposing appropriate tariffs. Diverse electricity tariffs for households are described, differing in energy prices and distribution rates in certain periods of a day. Demand price elasticity is calculated by comparing energy increases in zones using standard load profiles of customers settled according to the flat tariff and the time of use tariff. The values of demand price elasticity are then used to create customers' load profiles based on price changes within newly proposed tariffs. A forecast of the consumption rise resulting from the new implemented anti-smog tariff motivating consumers to use electricity during the low load period in the Polish power system is presented.

AB  - For modern energy markets it is typical to use dynamic real-time pricing schemes even for residential customers. Such schemes are expected to stimulate rational energy consumption by the end customers, provide peak shaving and overall energy efficiency. But under dynamic pricing planning a household's energy consumption becomes complicated. So automated planning of household appliances is a promising feature for developing smart home environments. Such a planning should adapt to individual user's habits and preferences over comfort to cost balance. We propose a novel approach based on learning customer preferences expressed by a utility function. In the paper an algorithm based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework is used to infer the user's hidden utility. We compare IRL-based approach to multiple state-of-the art machine learning techniques and the proposed earlier parametric Bayesian learning algorithm. The training and test datasets are generated by the simulated user's behavior with different price volatility settings. The goal of the algorithms is to predict a user's behavior based on the existing history. The IRL and Bayesian approaches showed similar performance and both of them outperforms modern machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, random forest etc. In particular, the preference learning algorithms significantly better generalize to data generated with parameters different from the training sample. The experiments showed that preference learning approach can be especially useful for smart home automation problems where future situations can be different from those available for training.

TI  - Cultural heritage in sustainable development Stone houses as environmental assets in the East Mediterranean
AU  - Chalhoub, MS
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Purpose - Preservation of historic structures meets ecological criteria of sustainable development. In Mount Lebanon, the traditional house is a cultural asset built of native stone one-meter thick double-wythe walls. Today, lack of public policies is causing those environmental assets to approach extinction. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
Design/methodology/approach - The methodology uses multivariate regression on 128 data points. A mathematical model is developed and empirically tested on public attitudes toward restoration. Independent variables represent the need for protectionist policies, X1; contribution of restoration to environmental sustainability, X2; contribution to culture, X3; and financial benefits, X4.
Findings - It is found that stone houses transfer heat significantly slower thanmodern construction. There is a statistically significant and positive correlation with X1, X2, and X3, but negative with X4, most likely due to favoring return on investment of multistory buildings over the attractiveness of stone houses.
Research limitations/implications - As future research implications, the undergirding of urban planning policies need to be revisited. Current policies neither protect heritage, nor offer legal means to restore heritage houses.
Practical implications - Practical implications include revisions to building laws in Mount Lebanon, as they marginalize old stone structures. Environmental valuation techniques, use value and existence value, are recommended. Social implications - Social awareness needs to be built about valuation techniques to account for complex assets that cannot be approximated through short-term real estate market price. Social rather than financial cost-benefit analysis must be performed to quantify environmental assets.
Originality/value - This research illustrates a pilot restoration project with critical issues faced by heritage stone houses. These assets are underrepresented in building laws which warrants social and environmental activism.

AB  - Reasons for disposal of domestic refrigerators and whether some of the appliances could potentially be re-used was studied. Based on visual inspection, a simple operational test and an electrical inspection, 28% of appliances were considered suitable for re-use. Potentially, these appliances could be provided cheaply or without cost to low income households. It might be unethical to provide low income households with appliances that had high energy use or performance issues, therefore the appliances were tested to compare the temperature and energy performance with their original stated performance. In addition the appliances were compared to current energy efficient appliances. For appliances where manufacturers data was available it was found that 18 (out of 22) appliances used more energy when tested than provided on the energy label, 1 appliance used almost identical energy and 3 appliances used less energy. Compared to current appliances only 5 appliances were better than or equal to an 'A' rated appliance.

AB  - Real estate- and property owners' rationales behind the adoption of Life Cycle Costing (LCC) respectively how LCC is actually used in renovation projects, is investigated through empirical data from a questionnaire survey sent to managers in Swedish real estate organisations. The study shows a positive attitude towards LCC. It is perceived to as a flexible and multi-functional tool with a familiar monetary format. Nevertheless, the study also reveals simplistic and undeveloped views of how to use LCC. While much research has focused on developing sophisticated LCC tools, the findings indicate that practitioners' interest in these refinements seems limited. The importance of understanding that LCC is used in a context of multiple and partly competing institutional logics of renovation is emphasised. The paper contributes to a more informed research in development of LCC tools as well as better informed LCC use among real estate and property owners.

AB  - The solar house (Ecohomes concept) is considered to have the greatest energy efficiency. Future energy savings will certainly compensate for the initial investment. This type of dwelling also has the least impact on the environment.
This paper presents a house that uses Trombe walls, situated in Oradea, Apateului Street and is the property of Sorin Dragan. The dwelling is in the study and planning phase.
More precisely, the house uses solar energy for heating and cooling. The building itself, made of materials which absorb and store heat from the environment, will function as a huge heat- generator.
All of these principles may be applied regardless of the house's design. The major assets of such a house are low maintenance costs, the negligible effects on the environment and its autonomy from conventional energy providers.

AB  - Housing estates built during the post-World War II decades in many countries have followed diverging trajectories. These include maintenance and repair, demolition, 'doing nothing,' and demolition with mixed-usage replacements. Drawing on empirical and historical material from Bucharest, Romania, a city in which 80% of the housing stock consists of socialist era housing estates, we argue that such housing continues to be viable and is even enjoying a minor renaissance, mainly through the financial efforts of residents and, occasionally, through the allocation of a certain amount of public funds. The empirical analysis illustrates that it is neither the mass character of such housing, nor its high-rise nature that creates the problems and negative image often associated with housing estates elsewhere in the world. Rather, we outline seven challenges faced by such estates: ageing of their structure and resident population, networked connectivity, energy efficiency, densification, urban planning that favours real estate agents, neglect of housing policies and housing rights, and condominium governance. The housing estates and their problems are so much a part of everyday normality in Bucharest that the local administration tends to take them for granted and has not placed them on the public agenda despite the inevitability of their structural decay at some time in the future. More than anything else, the state and the owners need to gather data in order to preempt future emergencies or continuing physical decay of this valuable housing stock.

AB  - Statement of the problem. An important reserve for decreasing the consumption of materials of gas pipelines is to increase the operating pressure in the gas distribution system. The introduction of the practice of design of the gas supply system with household stabilizers of pressure requires developments of scientific methods of calculation and design.
Results. The annual saving of fuel gas due to the pressure stabilization according to experimental research of the authors is 2-3 %. Installation of house regulators gas pressure also ensures saving of fuel gas. In the presence of stabilizers, gas plants operate at a gas pressure close to nominal, i. e. at maximum efficiency.
Conclusions. The results of the study allow us to conclude about the effectiveness of the use of networks of medium pressure gas with the subsequent reduction to the desired values brownies pressure controllers or regulators-stabilizers. Installation of household stabilizers gas pressure also provides fuel savings. In the presence of stabilizers gas-installations can operate at a pressure of the gas is close to par, i. e. with maximum efficiency. The research results lead to the conclusion about the effectiveness of the use gas network of medium pressure, followed by pressure reduction up to the required values of household pressure regulators or regulators-stabilizers.

AB  - Following Moore's law, the number of transistors on chip has grown exponentially for decades. This growing transistor count, coupled with recent architecture and compiler advances, has resulted in an unprecedented exponential performance increase of computers. With the end of Dennard scaling, however, the power required to operate all transistors at the full performance level simultaneously grows across the technology generations. Consequently, chips will keep an increasing fraction of transistors power gated or dark to remain within the power envelope. The power-gated part of the chip, known as dark silicon, is expected to comprise a significant portion of the die real estate in new technology generations. In addition to power limitations, the limited and nonscalable off-chip bandwidth is the second source of dark silicon. The key challenge to improving performance in the dark silicon era, consequently, is how to efficiently leverage transistors when they cannot all be powered at the same time. Core specialization shows promise in addressing this challenge by improving the performance and energy efficiency of applications. This method leverages the dark silicon to build many diverse power-efficient accelerators and each application only activates a subset of cores that best match its processing requirements. In this chapter, we propose a network-on-chip specialization method that leverages dark routers of a partially active many-core chip to customize the topology for active cores, effectively reducing the power consumption and latency of communication.

AB  - Construction of low-cost housing in Colombia is one of the greatest social challenges of the country. Due to Bogota's climate conditions at 8500 ft. of altitude and non-adapted materials to local conditions, the temperature of these state-subsidized dwellings is usually below optimum comfort standards. This research analyses the impact on temperatures using certain types of materials, comparing the effect of some traditional building skins-composed by brick and concrete - with a new wall envelope made of recycled elements. A comparative study was carried out by housing typologies, based on a work of measurement of the temperatures inside 16 individual dwellings.
Thermal simulations were made to compare the traditional brick envelope material vs a compacted plastic brick, and the results suggest that the construction of dwellings with traditional materials such as brick blocks and prefabricated concrete blocks may not provide the best conditions of thermal comfort. However, alternative materials made of recycled plastic can represent a cheaper, ecological and comfortable solution. Findings could be of interest for construction stakeholders for low-cost housing programs in resilient cities, within the framework of a new plastics economy.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumers' motivations and experiences who have purchased houses that are situated in a sustainability-based certified development and will have been required to comply with mandatory dwelling certification.
Design/methodology/approach The paper explores the awareness and perception of sustainability ratings and whether the motivations for purchasing in the sustainably certified development have heightened their awareness of sustainability and the resilience of new housing. This has been investigated through a pilot study of consumers who have purchased land in a certified estate and built a new home, through an online survey.
Findings The findings reveal that the rating systems are at present not having the desired influence as first thought; that is, to inform consumers of the sustainability of a dwelling or property and to instigate trust of the environmental credentials of the property.
Research limitations/implications This illuminating case study of participants who have purchased a sustainable rated development demonstrates that regardless of their concern for environmental issues, consumers have both low awareness and trust in the ratings. Despite this, consumers do seek value from these credentials to the overall property.
Originality/value This study aims to illustrate the disconnect in engagement between developers, builders and new home buyers in relation to sustainability certification and implementation.

TI  - A New Era of Pollution Progress in Urban China?
AU  - Zheng, SQ

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Over the last 30 years, China's economy has boomed. This trend has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty but it has also sharply increased local, regional, and global pollution levels. We look at the rise in air pollution over recent decades, and the perhaps surprising finding that in many of China's urban areas, levels of particulates (of less than 10 microns) have been decreasing during the last 10 to 15 years. We then turn to the costs and tradeoffs of air pollution, including costs to human health, reductions in worker productivity, and how people are seeking to reduce their exposure to pollution as shown by compensating differentials in real estate prices and purchases of masks and air filters. We discuss how rising incomes tend to raise the demand for environmental amenities and thus increase political pressure for environmental protection, and then we turn to the policy tools that China has used to reduce pollution. We conclude by arguing that as China's government is preparing for an additional 300 million people to move to urban areas over the next 30 years, it will have a number of opportunities for China to reduce pollution through a shift from manufacturing to services, along with various steps to improve energy efficiency and resource conservation. Overall, it seems that China is on track to improve its environmental performance in the years ahead.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - This article examines the impact of improving energy efficiency of office buildings on their financial risk. While multiple studies report a sustainability premium little is known about the corresponding risk. This research reviews the financial benefits in the context of their impact on risk. After a theoretical analysis of the topic, it forms two hypotheses which are supported with empirical tests performed on a large panel dataset of US commercial office buildings. Changes in the magnitude of the green premium in rent and changes in rental volatility are used as indicators of financial risk associated with energy certification. The study concludes that acquiring an EnergyStar certificate is related to a structural change in statistical characteristics of rents which may be related to the level of energy efficiency. The average effect is positive but varies over time.

AB  - European Directive on energy efficiency requires the settlement of energy consumers according to the actual consumption. The use of properly operating and socially acceptable settlement systems of individual heating costs contributes to energy savings in the residential sector. The paper presents the national legal requirements in this field and the possibility of using different settlement systems of heating costs. The main causes of irregularities in settlements of individual heating costs using heat cost allocators in housing sector in Poland are listed and described. There are presented proposals of existing irregularities elimination, in order to obtain adequate quality of the heating cost division in building into individual apartments.

TI  - Does the Energy Label (EL) Matter in the Residential Market? A Stated Preference Analysis in Barcelona
AU  - Marmolejo-Duarte, C

T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Energy performance in buildings has become a milestone in EU environmental policy in the last 15 years. Nonetheless, in some countries such as Spain the full acceptance of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is still relatively rare and novel, with little evidence as to how relevant it is in the real estate market. There are different reasons for this phenomenon: on the one hand, the real estate crisis has paralyzed the completion of most of the works in new/refurbished efficient buildings (which renders it impossible to use revealed preference methods); on the other hand, information is not complete and the consumer's perception of the relevant cost/benefits could be incorrect. For this reason, assessing the trade- off between the energy label and other specific attributes of the housing market has become important. To that end, a choice experiment following an RPL (Random Parameter Logit) model was employed. This form is suitable to accommodate various empirical situations where the assumptions of the Conditional Logit model have to be relaxed. Results suggest that the Energy Label (EL) does matter in the real estate market in relation to other residential attributes. Marginal willingness to pay for an "A" label instead of an "E" is significantly higher than the stated savings in energy costs. The respondents' utility function seems to be also influenced by their educational level, as well as by their preference to own a house as opposed to renting it.

AB  - Green building is an important component of sustainable real estate market development, and one of the reasons is that the construction industry consumes a high amount of resources. Energy consumption of construction industry results in greenhouse gas emissions, so green buildings, energy systems, building technologies and other aspects play an important role in sustainable development of real estate market, construction and environmental development. The aim of the research is to analyse environmental aspects of sustainable real estate market development, focusing on importance of green buildings at the industry level and related energy aspects. Literature review, historical, statistical data analysis and logical access methods have been used in the research. The conducted research resulted in high environmental rationale and importance of environment-friendly buildings, and there are many green building benefits during the building life cycle. Future research direction is environmental information process and its models.

TI  - Building energy efficiency: A research branch made of paradoxes
AU  - Copiello, S
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - The literature dealing with building energy efficiency has long since debated about the possible occurrence of the so-called Jevons' paradox. In a nutshell, benefiting from energy savings due to transition to high-performance buildings, may the same savings cause a kind of rebound effect, by acting as an incentive to increase consumptions? On closer inspection, this is not the only paradox affecting the research branch that focuses on the energy used by the buildings and the building industry. A second paradox is that investments in energy efficient solutions may contribute to energy price control, which in turn lends itself to make the same investments not profitable. A third paradox lies in the need to adopt energy-intensive materials in order to achieve substantial energy savings in operation; hence, sometimes, we just substitute a certain amount of operating energy with a more or less commensurate amount of embodied energy. Here we argue that the joint consideration of the paradoxes mentioned above should not be neglected since it brings with itself several implications needing to be disentangled, whether we aim to get further enhancements in this disciplinary field.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - We test for evidence that energy efficiency features are capitalized into home prices in three U.S. metropolitan areas. Using hedonic regressions and multiple matching procedures, we find that Energy Star certification is associated with higher sales prices in two of the markets: the Research Triangle region of North Carolina and Portland, Oregon. We find that local "green" certifications in Portland and in Austin, Texas, are also associated with higher prices and that the estimated price impacts are larger than those from Energy Star. Matching on observables proves to be important in some cases, reducing the estimated impacts compared with models without matching. We calculate the implied energy savings from the estimated premiums and find that, in the Research Triangle market, the Energy Star premiums approximately equal the savings that program is designed to achieve, but in Portland, the premiums are slightly greater than the program's savings due to low energy costs in the region.

Auction theory is used to model price formation where eco-investors may differ in their valuation of assets. Controlling for a large number of features, the empirical results provide evidence of a significant and positive relationship between investors' eco-certified market share and prices of eco-certified space. Contributing to the recent debate over the nature of the green premium, we find that eco-investors are creating clientele effects and that they may be subject to a green winner's curse.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper is to study and evaluate the situation of different affordable housing projects with an eye toward developing a new affordable and sustainable housing model in the hot-arid climate of Jordan. There is a clear interest in providing affordable housing, yet sustainable and environmental issues are highly marginalized. To bridge this gap, and to meet Jordanian housing needs while tackling environmental problems, this research has analyzed the environmental issues of selected housing projects in Jordan, aiming to determine the existing problems. In addition, it proposes a solution through a sustainable and affordable housing model that was analyzed and compared to the previously studied housing projects.
Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional design strategy was adopted and a mixed design method was used. Information related to the physical and operation characteristics of buildings was collected through the review of "as built" drawings and other relevant documents. Further information was obtained from field surveys and personal interviews with architects and decision-makers in the housing sector. Energy consumption patterns of these housing projects were analyzed using the DesignBuilder simulation program. Water efficiency was assessed using the BRE Code Water Calculator. Based on the previous analysis, a new housing model was developed that was evaluated in terms of energy and water consumption.
Findings - The analysis shows a significant difference among different housing projects in terms of energy cooling and heating loads in different climatic regions in Jordan. Energy analysis proved that the proposed model is energy efficient in different locations and it can save up to 50.4 per cent of annual energy usage in comparison with existing projects. In addition, it can save around 43 per cent of water consumption by using a number of modifications for saving water.
Originality/value - Most of the housing initiatives focus on providing affordable housing, yet sustainable and environmental issues are highly marginalized. This research will bridge the gap by reducing the operation cost of affordable housing through adapting and implementing sustainable measures of design and construction.

At this regard, it is necessary to put in evidence that a great heterogeneity exists on the Italian territory with reference to buildings energy performance; for this reason, being able to identify a class of most performing estimation models, suitable to separate the spatial effects from the influence of the building components
-including the energy rating-on the value, seems to be an interesting goal. In particular, this work illustrates an experiment based on the Spatial Auto Regressive (SAR) model implemented on a sample of residential units located in the city of Turin and represents a first step of a more wide research program.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the environmental credentials of steel buildings and to present the environmental impact categories and values in a steel housing activity through a case study of steel office building. In this framework, a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was applied, which provides an understanding of the overall environmental performance of a housing construction. The relative influence of the service lives of different building components compared to the energy use of the buildings with a different energy efficiency is presented. As the analysis showed, recycling of construction waste becomes a critical issue, which can ensure a number of environmental benefits. The aim of this research activity was also to point out the need for an integrated approach in the design process, combining environmental performance assessment with structural calculations. Environmental impact assessment of the construction activity was carried out, following the inventory listing, in order to reach to useful conclusions on the environmental study of the project. Although steel and concrete proved to be responsible for the negative environmental impacts the ability of reuse and recyclability of steel has decreased the negative impacts of steel construction on environmental burdens.

AB  - Purpose - Buildings contribute significantly to CO2 production. They are also subject to considerable taxation based on value. Analysis shows that while similar attributes contribute to both value and CO2 production, there is only a loose relationship between the two. If we wish to use taxation to affect policy change ( drive energy efficiency behaviour), we are unlikely to achieve this using only the current tax base (value), or by increasing the tax take off this current tax base (unlike extra taxation of cigarettes to discourage smoking, for example). Taxation of buildings on the basis of energy efficiency is hampered by the lack of current evidence of performance. This paper aims to model the now-obligatory (at sale or letting) energy performance certificate (EPC) data to derive an acceptable appraisal model (marked to market, being the EPC scores) and deploys this to the entire population of properties. This provides an alternative tax base with which to model the effects of a tax base switch to energy efficiency and to understand the tax incidence effects of such a policy.
Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a multiplicative hedonic approach to model energy efficiency utilising EPC holding properties in a UK jurisdiction [Northern Ireland (NI)] as the sample. This model is then used to estimate discrete energy assessments for each property in the wider population, using attributes held in the domestic rating (property tax) database for NI (700,000+ properties). This produces a robust estimate of the EPC for every property in its current condition and its cost-effective improved condition. This energy assessment based tax base is further used to estimate a new millage rate and property tax bill (green property tax) which is compared against the existing property tax based on value to allow tax incidence changes to be analysed.
Findings - The findings show that such a policy would significantly redistribute the tax burden and would have a variety of expected and some unexpected effects. The results indicate that while assessing the energy performance of houses can be a complex process involving many parameters, much of the explanatory power can be achieved via a relatively small number of input variables, often already held by property tax jurisdictions. This offers the opportunity for useful housing stock modelling - such as the savings possible from power switching. The research also identifies that whilst urban areas display the expected "heat island" effect in terms of energy consumption, urban properties are on average more efficient than suburban/rural properties. This facilitates spatial targeting of policy messages and initiatives.
Research limitations/implications - Analogous with other studies, data deficiencies introduce the risk of omitted variable bias. Modelling of the energy efficiency in the sample is limited to property attributes that are available for the wider population of properties. While this limits the modelling exercise, it is a perennial issue facing mass appraisal worldwide (where knowledge of the transacted sample attributes generally exceeds knowledge of the unsold properties). That said, the research demonstrates the benefits of sharing data and improving knowledge of the housing stock, as taxation databases would be stronger, augmented with EPC-derived property attributes for example.
Originality/value - The EPC lead in time for wide residential coverage is likely to be considerable. The paper contributes to emerging literature and policy debate surrounding the effect, performance measurement and implementation of energy efficiency certification, through a greater understanding of the sectorial and geographical dispersion of energy efficiency. It provides high level research to help guide policy and decision-making, identifying key locales where there is more of a physical problem and locations where there is more to gain in terms of targeting energy improvement and/or encouraging behavioural change. The paper also allows a glimpse of the implications of a change towards a taxation regime based on energy efficiency, which contributes to the debate surrounding the "greening" of property based taxes.

AB  - Since 2010 in Latvia energy efficiency improvement measures in residential buildings have been actively implemented with an aim to reduce heat energy consumption and heating costs in houses. The aim of the study is to find optimal solutions for reducing energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency indicators of heating and domestic hot water systems. In the framework of the study heat consumption analysis of the domestic hot water supply systems in residential buildings was carried out. The results showed that heat energy savings and home energy efficiency theoretically and optimistically predicted by the renovation project after three years of operation of renovated houses were not reached. It was concluded after a thorough analysis that the external enclosing construction insulation reached predicted energy savings. Energy efficiency of the heat supply system was low, thermal energy consumption was higher than expected. Central heating systems are hydraulically unstable because heat in apartments is regulated emotionally, exceeding the regulated operating mode. The domestic hot water supply systems low energy efficiency causes relatively large thermal energy losses in hot water distribution and in circulation pipelines. The project was implemented in 2014; after three heating seasons of operation data monitoring, fixation of project deficiency and correction of solutions were carried out. According to the operation data monitoring, this innovative system is the most functional and energy efficient, corresponding to installed requirements of the project. After the assembly was completed the system was tuned to work in calculation mode and put into operation. During operation while heat consumption regime is changing, the functional efficiency does not change. Apartment heating system heat output is automatically regulated according to the room temperature. Preparation of hot water is provided in every apartment's boiler capacity (in local space heaters) with the combined heating system heat transmission at 70 degrees C temperature. It provides hot water heating to 60 degrees C close to the final user and prevents the growth of microorganisms in hot water distribution system pipelines of the end user.

AB  - Cities across the globe occupy 3% of the earth's land surface, house half of the human population, use 75% of the resources and account for 2/ 3rd of all energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. Reliable estimates have pegged the urban population of the world by 2050 at 70%. To deal with the problems of urbanization such as population explosion, high level of pollution, traffic chaos, huge scarcity of houses, inadequate water supply, heaps of garbage, poor infrastructure, security concerns, unemployment, overpowering political set up, etc. the concept of inclusive Smart cities, evolved in the European Union and has now spread across the continents. Thus a new approach to take on the colossal challenges of this century has emerged.
It is expected that the Smart Cities will address public issues, employing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based solutions, on the basis of municipality driven multi-stakeholder partnership. The need to strengthen or extend citizens' participation in initiatives by Municipalities and emphasize establishment of more refined and accessible governance structure has been realized. While the concept of Smart Cities is still under development and evolution, it has caught on across the globe and has spearheaded a new approach to look at urban development and management. Cities have their own requirements and peculiar limitations necessitating public centric strategies, appropriate and economically viable technology and funding mechanisms.
Cities accommodate nearly 31% of India's current population and contribute 63% of GDP. Urban areas are expected to house 40% of India's population and contribute 75% of India's GDP by 2030. Indian Government would earmarkUSD1054 million to fund the development of a hundred Smart Cities with a view to address various problems arising out of an accentuated rate of population influx. The Mission will have duration of five years (FY2015-16 to FY2019-20). The city level Pre-takeoff Plans in respect of quite a few cities are stimulating investment by engaging identified stakeholders i. e. ICT businesses, real estate developers, infrastructure providers, retail business and transport operators to support Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects and actions. The objective of Indian Smart City initiatives is to increase the resilience of the city. It is proposed to develop the 100 Smart Cities as Satellite Towns of larger cities by modernizing existing mid-sized cities. The aim is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of ` Smart' Solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model which will act like a light house to other aspiring cities.
The new initiative of the Government of India to make cities capable of facing the 21st century challenges with the generous reliance on the latest frontiers of technologies available, serious efforts towards capacity building of the personnel manning the projects and above all employing methods to make them financially sustainable with little aid will go a long way in creating a Resurgent Urban India. The importance of deploying advanced technologies for solving the problems of city governance with ease cannot be undermined. But at the same time while embracing newer and smarter technologies to offer ease of doing business, care should be taken to make available services to the lowest denominator of the society too, in a way he/she is comfortable with.

AB  - A large portion of the human population now lives in cities and by 2050 even a larger fraction of people will be urban dwellers. Many metropolitan areas have seen tremendous real estate development in recent years, yet the roads, water mains, sewers, and power grids have seen no, or extremely limited, upgrades. Whatever infrastructure is in place is aging and, unfortunately, may experience temporary use rationing as upgrades are made, as often one reads in the local press and/or experiences personally. It is clear that technological solutions are needed to manage the increasingly-scarce infrastructure resources under the limitations imposed by population growth, limited financial resources, and, in many instances, local political inertia. The Internet of Things (IoT) offers the promise of improving the resource management of many assets related to city life - including the flow of goods, people, and vehicles, and the greening of the environment - by optimizing energy consumption and maximizing life-activity efficiency. This review article assesses some of the application issues, the technical requirements, and some of the technical solutions, including the use of High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and Mobile IPv6 Protocols (MIPv6), associated with a broad-based deployment of IoT capabilities in urban settings; these IoT-based solutions enables city administrations to approach a desired state where citizens can reliably enjoy the Quality of Life benefits afforded by a Smart City paradigm.

AB  - Internet of Things has gained a lot of hype in a very short period and is being adopted by varied sectors in order to attain its potential by bringing advanced level of automation in the respective industry based activities to reap the benefits. The commercial real estate is one such domain that many countries are focusing on transforming their buildings and infrastructure to have the cities contributing towards to become as 'smarter cities'. The intelligent buildings are where the schools, offices, residential complexes integrate IoT for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of the building infrastructure. The fundamental drivers that have encouraged for smart buildings in the market place are meeting the goals of corporate social responsibility, revenue growth and improving operational efficiency. With the demand for deployment of smart buildings on the rise, there have been many key trends that have emerged making it a thrust to have revolutionized transformation for digitalizing the commercial buildings, homes, etc. by means of effective smart solutions. The paper critically analyses the role of IoT in smart buildings, the latest trends that are demanding for a shift to smart buildings, and highlights the challenges for smart buildings implementation.

AB  - ABRACADABRA is an European Project funded by the Horizon 2020 Program, based on the assumption that substantial increase in the real estate value of the existing buildings can play a key role in the deep renovation. The project aims at demonstrating to the key stakeholders and fmancial investors the attractiveness of a new renovation strategy based on volumetric Add-ons and Renewable energy sources (AdoRES) intended as one (or a set of) Assistant Building unit(s) like aside or facade additions, rooftop extensions or even an entire new building construction that "adopt" the existing buildings (the Assisted Buildings) to achieve nearly zero energy. The creation of these AdoRES aims at reducing the initial investment allocated for the deep renovation of the existing building creating an up-grading synergy between old and new. The ABRA strategy can thus result in the implementation of a punctual densification policy that aims at fostering the investments in deep renovation of the existing built environment, driving process innovation in the construction and the real estate sector. The paper, after outlining the main aspect of the project, focuses on a case study in Italian context, where different technological solutions and related economic impact are analysed: from a deep renovation to AdoRES strategies and different scenarios of renovation. The preliminary feasibility study and cost assessment, show the benefit given by the presented strategy in overcoming actual financial e tecnical barriers. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - The Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) market is still embryonic in South Europe since there are still many barriers: difficult access to financing, limited investors' confidence in EPC models, scarcity of flagship projects, lack of certification schemes and financing mechanisms, especially for the tertiary sector (hospitality, tourism, healthcare), which presents a huge potential for Energy Efficiency (EE). The Trust EPC South project, funded by Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, aims to scale up investments in EE solutions in the private tertiary sector in South Europe, by delivering a robust investment standardization and benchmarking framework and a pipeline of bankable EPC projects in 6 countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia and Greece); its results will eventually be extended to the Balkan. Tailored capacity building activities will allow an easier access to third-party financing, thus unlocking the large tertiary sector EE and Renewable Energy market potential.
Initially, national market analyses took place (EPC providers, beneficiaries-clients, and financial institutions) to identify the market potential. National Discussion Platforms were set up to develop the national roadmaps addressing mechanisms for mitigation of policy, legal, and especially financial barriers. An investment standardization and benchmarking framework, built upon an established real estate assessment tool (Green Rating T), is actually setting up in order to build trust amongst all parts of the EPC value chain. The methodology will be upgraded including a financial assessment model. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing number of smart appliances equipped with sensors, actuators and tags connected to the Internet and their ability to communicate with one another forms the basis for an Internet of Things (IoT). The data recorded by smart appliances can be utilized to detect energy savings potential and to increase energy efficiency in households. Despite these possibilities, value-added services which successfully incentivize customers to save energy are missing or are still immature. In this paper, we propose a solution for a smart energy platform that aims at reducing this gap by providing the infrastructure and tools which enable the integration of smart appliances and the development of value-added services for an automated energy management in households. In this context, we give an overview of the main challenges for IoT platforms in general and show that existing solutions currently do not fully meet them.

AU  - Kelly, JA

T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - International commitments on greenhouse gases, renewables and air quality warrant consideration of alternative residential heating technologies. The residential sector in Ireland accounts for approximately 25% of primary energy demand with roughly half of primary home heating fuelled by oil and 11% by solid fuels. Displacing oil and solid fuel usage with air source heat pump (ASHP) technology could offer household cost savings, reductions in emissions, and reduced health impacts. An economic analysis estimates that 60% of homes using oil, have the potential to deliver savings in the region of 600 per annum when considering both running and annualised capital costs. Scenario analysis estimates that a grant of 2400 could increase the potential market uptake of oil users by up to 17% points, whilst a higher oil price, similar to 2013, could further increase uptake from heating oil users by 24% points. Under a combined oil-price and grant scenario, CO2 emissions reduce by over 4 million tonnes per annum and residential PM2.5 and NOx emissions from oil and peat reduce close to zero. Corresponding health and environmental benefits are estimated in the region of 100m per annum. Sensitivity analyses are presented assessing the impact of alternate discount rates and technology performance. This research confirms the potential for ASHP technology and identifies and informs policy design considerations with regard to oil price trends, access to capital, targeting of grants, and addressing transactions costs.

TI  - Housing Market Fundamentals, Housing Quality and Energy Consumption: Evidence from Germany
AU  - Claudy, M

T2  - ENERGY JOURNAL
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between regional housing market fundamentals and energy consumption. We argue that dwellings, in particularly rental properties, are not only consumer goods, but also constitute financial market assets. Properties are spatially fixed and traded in regional contexts, where real estate market characteristics like vacancy, income levels, and expectations determine rent and prices, which in turn provide incentives to invest in housing quality. The level of housing quality (e.g. windows, building materials, or heating technology) in turn influences the level of energy consumption. While this view is established in the real estate and urban economics literature, it has only recently found its way into the energy debate. As a result, the relationship between regional housing market fundamentals and energy consumption has received little attention. This study provides a first attempt to address this paucity. Utilizing aggregate data on regional space-heating energy consumption from over 300,000 apartment buildings in 97 German planning regions, the study applies structural equation modeling to estimate the influence of housing market fundamentals on the level housing quality, and subsequently on regional energy consumption. Findings provide first evidence that regional differences in housing market conditions have a significant impact on housing quality and energy consumption. Specifically, the results suggest that carbon abatement programs in buildings should focus on regions with weak housing market fundamentals, as market incentives are unlikely to incentivize investors to invest in housing quality attributes. The authors conclude by highlighting important implications for energy research and avenues for further investigations.

T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Building sector is responsible for 40% of European energy consumption, of which heating and cooling account for around 70%. Moreover, 75% of buildings for 2050 are already built in Europe. On the road to a sustainable energy transition, this article develops a multi-criteria assessment methodology for the environmental, economic and social evaluation of different residential energy retrofit solutions, based on effectiveness indices. This methodology allows improving the decision management in residential energy retrofitting by identifying the most effective solutions according to the requirements and needs of each intervening agent (citizens, public administrations and private promoters). The methodology is based on the integrated analysis of environmental, economic and social variables. It is applied to a Mediterranean case study from Southern Spain built in 1955. As part of methodology, survey data from the different stakeholders were collected, identifying the keys that condition the viability of the measures. The results show that measures with few inconveniences to tenants, investment costs below 2000(sic)/dwelling and payback periods below 15 years are the most viable by end-users' implementation in the Mediterranean area, but between them, only efficient heat pumps allow achieving more than 45% of CO2 emissions reduction (with a payback period of 6 years).

T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - China's residential electricity demand has grown rapidly over the last three decades and given the expected continued growth, demand side management (DSM) can play an important role in reducing electricity demand. By using micro-level data collected from 1450 households in 27 provinces in the first ever China Residential Energy Consumption Survey in 2012, this study estimates the effects of three DSM measures empirically: tiered household electricity pricing, China Energy Label program, and information feedback mechanisms. We find these measures have contributed to moderating residential electricity demand growth but additional policy reform and tools are needed to increase their effectiveness and impact. Residential electricity demand is found to be price- and income- inelastic and tiered pricing alone may not be as effective in electricity conservation. The statistically significant relationship between China Energy Label efficient refrigerators - but not televisions - and lowered residential electricity consumption reflect mixed program effectiveness. Lastly, of the information feedback currently available through electricity bills, payment frequency and meters, only meter reader is estimated to be statistically significant. Important policy implications and recommendations for improving each of these three DSM measures to expand their impact on reducing residential electricity consumption are identified.

AB  - This paper is an empirical study of the relationship between the energy performance rating of residential homes in the Dublin market between 2009 and 2014 and their market prices, controlling for building type, size, age and location. Initial results suggest that energy efficiency has a significant, positive relationship with list price. A 50-point improvement in the Energy Performance Indicator (kWh/m(2)/year) is associated with a 1.5 % higher list price. Alternatively, using the Building Energy Rating metric, a 1-point improvement in the 15-point scale from G to A1 yields a list price increase of 1 %. This mirrors findings for efficiency price premiums on a nationwide basis from Hyland et al. (2013). We also find that it is important to include controls for the age of the dwelling to avoid biased energy efficiency estimates in the hedonic model.

AB  - In order to tap the energy saving and climate mitigation potential of buildings, transaction costs of implementing energy efficient technologies need to be better understood and ultimately reduced. The objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the nature and scale of transaction costs resulting from the application of the passive house concept in energy efficient renovations. Related conceptual choices are also discussed. This study explores learning strategies as a potential to reduce transaction costs. It focuses on transaction costs borne by building owners and building developers in the planning and implementation phases of a passive house-oriented renovation in Sweden. Results reveal three main sources of transaction costs: due diligence, negotiations and monitoring. The analysis shows that transaction costs are non-negligible and for individual cost sources the scale can be three times higher than for conventional renovations. To reduce transaction costs, various learning strategies such as study visits, demonstration projects, new forms of meetings and new channels of (written) information were found. These strategies have the potential to half transaction costs of future renovation projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Building energy code change in Australia, and many other developed nations, is subject to standardised economic tests, with a net present value calculation at the heart of the economic analysis. Although many nations have introduced minimum energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial buildings, increases in stringency have been hindered by limitations to the range of private and societal impacts typically incorporated in regulatory impact assessments. Given the policy move towards net zero energy homes, a more comprehensive set of inputs and robust assumptions are needed to support further regulatory change. Yet the literature provides substantial evidence of many private and societal costs and benefits not commonly incorporated into the economic assessments that underpin regulatory change. Drawing on a case study of Australian and UK residential regulatory change assessments, this paper highlights limitations to the range of inputs and assumptions currently incorporated within the economic arguments applied during residential energy code change processes, and presents a more comprehensive economic argument that could support further stringency improvements.

A cross-sectional comparison of municipalities with and without green private residential incentive programs indicates which government levels of policy issuance and which types of certification programs prove most successful, and when those impacts should be expected. Findings indicate that only municipalities experience success with construction-related policies, which may be tailored to their local market's construction demands. Business-related policies, however, prove effective at all levels of government implementation, with particular success at the state level. Lastly, event studies and multiyear window data indicates that green incentive policies elicit the greatest change 2 to 3 years after their implementation.

AB  - One of the key issues that determine the wellbeing of young people in Britain is their prospect of living and raising a family in a house of their own. In an ideal scenario, a young professional couple should be able to purchase a comfortable and affordable home as they need it, but in the recent years, the affordability of new homes for young people has become a problem as house prices rose. Moreover, the British government is committed to reducing Britain's carbon emissions [1], and for future home owners this means that new houses must meet strict criteria ensuring that they are equipped with energy saving features that make them eco friendly. Britian's ideal ecohouse of the future is a very high energy efficiency rating home, a zero carbon home. However, these requirements increase the building cost of new homes, which in turn can raise the house prices even further. This article surveys new energy saving solutions which are being implemented in British homes and evaluates their effectiveness and cost. Using desk top research as the method for this enquiry the authors attempt to sketch the image of the (possible) house of the future - a type of dwelling that new home buyers should be buying in years to come - if they can afford it.

AB  - Air infiltration, occurring through gaps in the building envelope, can contribute up to one third of total heat losses associated with older UK dwellings [1]. Therefore, reducing the rate of air leakage (i.e. improving air 'tightness') can have a positive effect in terms of decreasing space heating requirements.
This study presents an investigation of the effectiveness of airtightness measures applied in a retrofit context to a UK dwelling. A phased programme of refurbishment work was undertaken to a test dwelling at the University of Nottingham campus, UK. Evaluation techniques, including building energy modelling (SAP 2009), air pressurisation tests and thermal imaging, were performed. The study demonstrates that the use of conventional draught-proofing measures can achieve a reduction in air permeability of over 30% when compared with the house base case value of 15.57 m(3)/(h.m(2)) @ 50 Pa. This reduction was only achievable with close attention to installation detail. Further measures of service penetration and floor sealing enabled the air permeability to be reduced to as low as 4.74 m(3)/(h m(2)) @ 50 Pa.
Modelling of the test dwelling predicted an initial space heating supply energy requirement of 32,373 kWh, which was reduced to 23,197 kWh by a combination of the air tightness measures, insulation, and system (boiler and ventilation) improvements. Air tightness measures alone contributed to approximately 9% of the predicted total reduction, half of which was due to relatively straight-forward draught-proofing. Other more advanced air tightness measures were considerably more expensive, though cheaper approaches to their application could help reduce payback times. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the objectives of the EU Single Market Strategy adopted in 2015 is to enable Europeans to work wherever they choose in the EU. To fulfill this objective and to make it easier to exercise the freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment, the professional qualification recognition has to be guaranteed. When a profession is regulated in the EU country of destination, professionals with equivalent qualifications from another EU country may need to get those qualifications recognized before they can start working there. The European Professional Card (EPC) is created to help in this process.
The European Professional Card was introduced by the Directive 2013/55/EU which amends the Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications. Directive 2013/55/EU introduces a common framework for training (CTF) which provides automatic recognition on the basis of accepted minimum common set of knowledge, skills and competencies required to perform a certain profession. The directive promotes the ECTS system (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation system) and introduces the possibility of expressing the duration of program in ECTS credits within the program as defined in Directive 2005/36/EC which acquired qualifier necessary for dealing a regulated profession.
The introduction of the European Professional Card is one of the major achievements of the Directive 2013/55/EU. It was created to provide a system of recognition of professional experience and to promote automatic recognition of this experience across the EU as the response for different obstacles to the core principles of the Single Market for services that traditionally exist within the territory of different member states.
In 2015 the European Commission adopted the implementing regulation to introduce the European Professional Card for the first five professions: general care nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, real estate agents and mountain guides who were selected among those having expressed an interest, following thorough consultations with stakeholders and Member States.
Authors in the paper analyze the current situation within the European Union Single Market for services and possibilities for professionals to go cross border with no obstacles including the analysis of the European Court of Justice judgments as an important source of the EU law. The result of this analysis will give the answer on actual value of the European Professional Card for the business practi

AB  - Huge amounts of data can be collected from smart buildings for accurate diagnostics. However, analyzing, storing and processing this data require huge resources as well as advanced software that implements innovative algorithms for accurate smart building diagnostics. This can be very costly for smart buildings owners. Cloud computing can provide a scalable and cost-effective platform to satisfy these needs. Cloud computing is an emerging commercial IT infrastructure model that offers to eliminate the need for clients to maintain in-house high-cost hardware, software, and network infrastructures. It also reduces or even eliminates the high-cost of recruiting technical professionals to support these infrastructures and operate the in-house IT solutions. This paper proposes a new cloud service that provides some mechanisms for smart building diagnostics that clients, smart building owners and managers, can use. This service is called Smart Building Diagnostics as a Service (SBDaaS). The paper presents an architecture developed for this service. In addition, it discusses the opportunities of utilizing such a service.

AB  - The real estate market in the Czech Republic and even in other countries in the Central Europe is undergoing a change of the structure of estates which are traded there. This is due to a gradual growth of number of energy efficient buildings. However, the share of these property is in total still rather low which is besides other things caused by difficulty of their market valuation. Objective appraisal of real estates must reflect the market economy settings within the social and environmental contexts and it has to adequately react to changing needs of both real estate market and banking, construction and legislation, together with state and local authorities. This paper analyses the real estate market in the segment of modern buildings and their relationship to the traditional construction fund. It also describes the most important principles of objective valuation of energy efficient buildings, assesses motivational stimuli for development of this segment of real estate market and predicts its potential development in future.

TI  - Energy efficiency: behavioural effects of occupants and the role of refurbishment for European office buildings
AU  - Surmann, M

T2  - PACIFIC RIM PROPERTY RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB  - Energy consumption in office buildings is determined partly by fixed building characteristics, but also by the behaviour of occupants. Within the European Union, office buildings have become subject to more stringent energy efficiency regulation for new construction or extensive refurbishment, with the aim to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The study determines the influence of physical building characteristics and occupant behaviour on energy consumption, and in particular, the role of refurbishment in different intensities on energy consumption is investigated. The data-set of the Green Rating Alliance is tested to provide evidence, by applying multiple regression models for energy consumption. The results highlight considerably increased energy consumption of single-tenant compared to multi-tenant office buildings. Very large office buildings consume significantly more energy per square metre that their smaller peers. A building's modelled water consumption turns out to be a good indicator for the actual energy consumption, emphasising the importance of assessing further sustainability measures. Overall, buildings of higher age turn out to be of lower energy consumption, pointing to additional appliances and equipment in more recent buildings, to provide better services and more comfort. In general, extensive refurbishment measures account for significant higher energy use, since the overall quality of the buildings is improved with additional appliances and equipment. Testing for the interaction effect between building age and refurbishment, the results demonstrate significantly lower additional energy consumption for buildings with more recent extensive refurbishment, compared to those with refurbishment several years ago. However, the results need to be considered with precaution against deriving firm conclusions due to the small sample size and some drawbacks in the applied data-set.

A2  - Schlueter, A
AB  - Nowadays rating systems to assess the sustainability of the built environment are available worldwide. The idea that a rating system based on indicators and a sustainability score can guarantee architectural quality, reliability, energy efficiency, economic convenience and finally a sustainability label, produces an increased value of the building on the real estate market giving an "aura" of advanced product to the building itself. It is well known that different rating systems can give a different sustainability score because similar areas of evaluation in different rating systems are not equal in term of indicators' weight. Moreover, the continuous updating of the rating systems tries to include in the assessment procedures a tailored vision coming from field experience. The building rating systems were born in the last 15 years (i. e. 1998-2004), while rating systems for urban districts are more recent (2009-2012). The paper provides a survey on the more influential and worldwide diffused rating systems, highlighting the differences in terms of organization and relationship between evaluation areas and comparing existing rating schemes with recent EU research projects and initiatives such as the "Common European framework for Sustainable Building Assessment" (CESBA) framework. The paper aims to report the preliminary analysis on the similarities and differences among rating systems, towards a harmonization of sustainability practices to be applied to new and existing buildings. A network analysis and visualization tool has been applied to show the structural analogies among rating systems through an innovative methodological approach which aims to enable a further development in this field by linking more directly these tools with computational tools used in the building lifecycle.

AB  - Real time communication applications including Mobile learning application can be integrated with other software applications into one platform and deployed in private clouds to reduce capital expenditure and lower overall costs of daily based maintenance and real estate required for computer hardware. As a critical component of private clouds, virtualization may adversely affect a real time communication application running in virtual machines as the layer of virtualization on the physical server adds system overhead and contributes to capacity lose. Virtualization in the mobile can enable hardware to run with less memory and fewer chips, reducing costs and increasing energy efficiency as well. It also helps to address safety and security challenges, and reduces software development and porting costs. This study will investigate how to build an effective learning environment for both the University and learners by integrating the virtualization, private cloud technology and mobile learning applications.

AU  - Persson, J

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - From the perspective of construction companies, this paper investigates the existence and significance of barriers and driving forces for the implementation of energy-efficient houses in Sweden. Here, eleven construction companies that build low-energy buildings comparable in performance with passive houses have been interviewed. One conclusion is that there is not one specific barrier that keeps energy-efficient housing from taking off. Instead, the barriers include a whole range of issues that have to be considered. Internal pressure has been a strong contributor to the onset of passive house constructions within the companies and the results indicate that personal commitment is central and perhaps the strongest driver. A general reflection from the interviews is that there is a need to show both construction companies and potential customers that it is possible to build passive houses and that they exist. Unlike the national building regulations, which are not considered to be relevant when it comes to energy consumption, the future building regulations from the European Union are identified as a regulatory driver. Moreover, life-cycle thinking is reported to increase among actors, but that it would be beneficial if banks as well as real estate agents could develop a comprehensive view and become better at considering energy and LCC in their capital budgeting templates. Even if the interest for passive houses is considered low among the public, the market is identified as promising among the construction companies recently actually large enough to become a driver in itself.

I find no evidence that electricity prices affect the propensity for consumers to choose high efficiency appliances. Point estimates are extremely small and precisely estimated. The findings suggest that price-based energy policies may be limited in the extent to which they increase investment in residential energy efficiency, which has been considered one of the lowest cost opportunities for reducing carbon emissions.

AB  - Energy certification of buildings, mandatory under the European Directive EPBD provides interesting data on the thermo-physical properties and geometry of existing buildings. Although the energy certificate is intended to provide the characteristics of individual buildings, so stimulating the real estate market toward ever better energy performance, data management of the certificates issued over time, using a national or regional energy cadastre, makes available a data base which is useful for energy planning in the building sector.
This paper provides the needed results of a benchmarking study on data from the energy cadastre of the Lombardy Region, northern Italy. By integrating data from the energy cadastre (175.778 energy certificates) with the statistical data obtained from the national census, indicators were obtained on the energy performance of existing buildings.
The energy indicators obtained, characterised by building type and construction period, normalised as a function of Degree-Days, become an effective tool for energy planning at local and regional scales. In the specific case, the energy indicators have been used to estimate the potential for energy retrofit of existing buildings in the Lombardy Region. The same indicators can also be used by municipalities for energy planning at the municipal or district level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Residential energy scheduling is a hot topic nowadays in the background of energy saving and environmental protection worldwide. To achieve this objective, a new residential energy scheduling algorithm is developed for energy management, based on action dependent heuristic dynamic programming. The algorithm works under the circumstance of residential real-time pricing and two adjacent housing units with energy inter-exchange, which can reduce the overall cost and enhance renewable energy efficiency after long-term operation. It is designed to obtain the optimal control policy to manage the directions and amounts of electricity energy flux. The algorithm's architecture is mainly constructed based on neural networks, denoting the learned characteristics in the linkage of layers. To get close to real situations, many constraints such as maximum charging/discharging power of batteries are taken into account. The absent energy penalty cost is developed for the first time as a part of the performance index function. When the environment changes, the residential energy scheduling algorithm gains new features and keeps adapting in real-time operations. Simulation results show that the developed algorithm is beneficial to energy conversation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Circulation pumps are mechanical devices, which are used to create the overpressure required for the transportation of a heat-transfer medium in heating technology as well as in other related technologies. In a circulation pump the mechanical energy generated by the drive machine - an electric motor is transformed to hydraulic energy, which consists of kinetic and static energy. In the pipeline of a heating system circulation pumps represent a source of hydraulic energy (positive differential pressure), which is consumed to transport the heat-transfer medium. During the flow, the heat-transfer medium puts up resistance to the so-called passive resistors, which consist of pressure losses from friction in the pipes and pressure losses due to local resistance. In this article the authors analyze the effect of a circulation pump on the operating costs in an apartment building. Different types of circulating pumps, ranging from the most unfavorable to the optimal, were selected.

AB  - The increase of people living in large cities and the expansion of new urban areas are keys to defining new sustainable models. It is estimated that about 70% of the EU population lives in urban areas, and it is expected to reach 80% by 2030. Consequently, it is important to find a new concept of buildings that can reduce the total energy consumption. The Solar Decathlon is an international university competition, born in 2002, created by the U.S. State Energy Department (DOE). Students are challenged to design and operate a full-scale, innovative and sustainable house able to exploit solar radiation as its sole energy source. The objective of the competition is to promote research and education in sustainable architecture and solar energy fields. This paper presents an overview on the contribution of LIFT (Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Technical Physics of Roma Tre University) to the winning project of the Solar Decathlon Europe 2014 competition: The RhOME for denCity. This project consists of a building properly designed to produce a solar-powered house that is cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive.

T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - The energy efficiency of the residential housing stock plays a key role in strategies to mitigate climate change and global warming. In this context, it is frequently argued that private investment and the quality of thermal upgrades are too low in the light of the challenges faced and the potential energy cost savings. While many authors address the potential barriers for investors to increase energy efficiency, studies on the capabilities of different investors to reduce energy requirements of their property are scarce. This study investigates potential advantages of housing company's size, i.e. economies of scale, economies of scope and institutional learning in thermal upgrades of residential housing. Based on unique data on energy consumption in 102,307 apartment buildings in Germany, we present new evidence for the advantages and disadvantages of a housing company's size in "green" retrofitting projects. Our estimations show, that large housing companies outperform private landlords by far in high effort refurbishment projects. In contrast, private landlords appear to have advantages in low effort, incremental refurbishment activities. We demonstrate that a substantial share of the advantages of larger firms can be associated with specialization (i.e. repeated projects). The results offer new options for policy makers to refine the support schemes toward a low carbon housing stock. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there is lack of a systematic review of this large number of studies that is critical for the future endeavor. This paper reviews the existing body of knowledge related to green development. At first, the common research themes on green real estate development were identified, including concept, measure, business, and result. Then, the connotation and denotation of green real estate development was introduced in four dimensions. Third, the stakeholders of green real estate development and its benefits and costs were expatiated. Then, how to realize the green real estate development and its current weakness were analyzed in various aspects. It is found that the existing studies mainly focus on the environmental aspect of green building, other dimensions of sustainability of green building, especially the social sustainability is largely overlooked.

AU  - Filippi, M
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Latest European Union programs related to energy efficiency underline the need for retrofitting existing buildings, which are responsible for 40% of EU final energy consumption. Although new buildings can be constructed with high performance levels, the majority of the building stock, characterized by a low energy performance, still needs renovation. Thanks to its potential to deliver high energy and CO2 savings, green retrofitting of existing buildings can thus play a pivotal role in creating a sustainable future. In this context, interventions on buildings constructed before 1945 (commonly defined as "historic buildings") mean a higher benefit/cost ratio, because, in many cases, green retrofitting can be linked to unavoidable refurbishment works and renovated buildings can take on an interesting market value. However, an important part of these historic buildings in Italy is composed of cultural heritage buildings; these buildings require a specific design approach, and green retrofitting is often not attractive from an economic point of view. The remarks reported in this work aim to stimulate a discussion on operational procedures, barriers and challenges that investors, professional figures and supervisory authorities can encounter when they are engaged in the green retrofitting of historic buildings belonging to Italian cultural heritage.

AB  - The trade-off between investing in energy savings and investing in individual heating technologies with high investment and low variable costs in single family houses is modelled for a number of building and consumer categories in Denmark. For each group the private economic cost of providing heating comfort is minimised. The private solution may deviate from the socio-economical optimal solution and we suggest changes to policy to incentivise the individuals to make choices more in line with the socioeconomic optimal mix of energy savings and technologies.
The households can combine their primary heating source with secondary heating e.g. a woodstove. This choice results in increased indoor air pollution with fine particles causing health effects. We integrate health cost due to use of woodstoves into household optimisation of heating expenditures.
The results show that due to a combination of low costs of primary fuel and low environmental performance of woodstoves today, included health costs lead to decreased use of secondary heating. Overall the interdependence of heat generation technology- and heat saving-choice is significant. The total optimal level of heat savings for private consumers decrease by 66% when all have the option to shift to the technology with lowest variable costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In developed economies a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions result from energy demand in the building sector. Many countries have recognized the need to mandate building energy performance standards as a key element of a national energy or climate change policy. The Commonwealth of Australia included energy efficiency provisions in the national Building Code early last decade. This initiative has not been without controversy or resistance from some industry stakeholders. Typically such opposition is predicated on the assertion that more stringent energy efficiency requirements, particularly in the residential sector, would detrimentally impact on housing affordability. The State of Victoria significantly upgraded its residential energy efficiency requirements in 2004. This study of the new standard [the 5-Star Standard] investigates its effectiveness as an instrument of energy policy, testing the assumption that more stringent regulatory requirements are at odds with housing affordability, used here in its commonly understood form of initial capital cost. The analysis concludes that the 5-Star Standard has delivered significant greenhouse abatement; and encouraged industry innovation in a way that embodies regulatory best practice; while at the same time not compromising housing affordability for consumers or impacting negatively on the local housing market overall.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to propose a decision support tool that would aid decision-makers to implement energy-saving measures efficiently in a corporate real estate.
Design/methodology/approach - The tool consists of a system dynamic model that allows describing and quantifying the complex interaction between potential maintenance scenarios, external energy factors and case-specific conditions. In addition, to include the uncertainty of some of the input variables related to the external energy factors, Monte Carlo simulation has been applied.
Findings - A case study of a city hall in The Netherlands showed the usability of the proposed tool. Over the selected period of 20 years, applying the chosen set of interventions, the simulation showed possible gains in the net present value and significant decrease of energy consumption and carbon emission. Municipal officials and consultants verified the tool for energy efficiency.
Research limitations/implications - Although the tool has proved its functionality in one case study, to test its robustness, additional case studies would be preferable.
Practical implications - The assessment tool can help organizations in assessing energy-efficient maintenance scenarios that include multiple technical energy efficiency interventions as a part of other maintenance activities.
Originality/value - There are numerous ways to increase building's energy efficiency, but a lack of knowledge is often hindering the enhancement of maximal benefits. A tool that would assess both financial and environmental benefits of potential technical intervention would provide useful insights into corporate's real estate current and possible future energy performance. This would aid corporations in making better decisions regarding finances, and on the long run, it will bring an improved corporate image.

AB  - Existing formal low-cost houses in South Africa have been shown to be very thermally and energy inefficient. This is problematic for the country since the government has built roughly 2.8 million of these houses to date.
Inefficiency in these houses can be effectively addressed by installing ceilings, but the cost thereof is unfortunately too high to be affordable to the applicable sector of the population. New options need to be considered to reduce costs.
Research has shown that practically any material can be used as a ceiling if it provides a barrier to heat flow and eliminates infiltration. The material should ideally possess good thermal properties and comply with standard building regulations, but most importantly, it must be very cheap and easy to install.
The low-cost ceiling proposed in this paper has all of these attributes, and installation thereof could result in substantial energy savings, improved indoor comfort, and a better quality of life.

AB  - The recovery and enhancement of historic buildings require interventions aimed also at the energetic requalification. Indeed, on one side there is a growing attention to the reuse of these buildings not only for conservative purposes, but even for economic and environmental aims; by forcing to include in the project even the energy efficiency improvement. On the other side, the current legislation on environmental sustainability in construction gives clear guidelines in energetic improvement object regarding the entire real estate assets, including historic buildings.
The paper aims to define a technical-economic model for the selection of technologically advanced interventions useful to improve the buildings energy performance of historical and architectural interest. This can happens by respecting the needs and regulations on the protection of the valued property.
The software implementation for the energy characterization of the historic building and the use of cost-benefit analysis, allow to drawing up an analysis protocol to support investment decisions. The issues research about the low thermal and acoustic insulation of the building envelopment and inefficient plants leads to outline intervention strategies and corresponding technical solutions, listed in detail in the article.
The research appears important on the theoretic side because rationalizes the various phases necessary for the selection of the energetic requalification interventions, for which the cash flows analysis is essential to ensure the financial sustainability of the initiative. It's also true in operative terms since it provides an easy instrumentation to professionals and operators in this sector to lead towards technologically efficient interventions, profitable in management phase and respectful of the historical and architectural values of the built heritage.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - The paper aims to estimate the effect of energy efficiency on the Market Value of office buildings and consider whether this effect increases over time.
Design/methodology/approach - The authors analyze a dataset of office building valuations from 2009 to 2011, provided by the German Investment Property Database. The authors use hedonic regression models to determine the effect of energy efficiency and energy consumption on Market Values. Using generalized additive models (GAM) for modeling nonlinear covariate effects, the authors control for further building characteristics and location. Due to the small sample size, the authors introduce an innovative econometric approach that mitigates this problem.
Findings - Mainly due to the small sample size, and in spite of the newly developed econometric methodology, the authors do not find clear evidence of the relationship between energy efficiency and the Market Value. However, the study nonetheless provides interesting insights into the composition of office building Market Values in Germany.
Originality/value - In addition to the empirical results for the German office market, the main contribution of this paper lies in the econometric methodology. Beside the application of cutting-edge statistical techniques, the authors develop a method for handling datasets, for which the variable of interest is rarely observed, leveraging on the total available data. Thus, the methodology offers promising prospects for future research in similar settings.

TI  - How do office buildings take advantage of energy efficiency? A study of the relationship between operating expenses and energy certification
AU  - Szumilo, N
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This research examines the relationship of operating expenses and energy certification in US offices. Data for four markets over a period from Q1 2007 to Q1 2011 is used. EnergyStar certification scores are used to determine the level of energy efficiency and a hedonic pricing method to model operating expenses. The results indicate a positive but non-linear relationship between costs and efficiency. Out of a number of considered explanations this seems to be best explained by initial technological difficulties in implementing energy efficiency, a self-selection bias influencing the data or a combination of different effects.

AB  - Space heating cost allocation according to actual consumption can be one possible solution for saving energy as residents are more motivated to regulate indoor air temperature. Introduction of heat cost allocators is a technique which can be used to ensure that the consumer pays only for the heat supplied to him. Installation of allocators increases the motivation of inhabitants to regulate indoor temperatures and thereby reduce heat consumption. Nevertheless, different criterions need to be taken into account in order to fairly allocate the heat costs in each apartment. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Consider the task of tracking the energy use of an entire city while also working to reduce it by 50% in 17 years. How would you go about tracking and verifying such reductions? Further, how would this be accomplished in a city without a database of building-specific characteristics and no energy reporting law? To begin, let's consider what this task would look like for one building. Where to start? Let's try with a performance metric and point of comparison.
Just as cars gauge performance by MPG, and pitchers by ERA, buildings can use Energy Use Intensity (EUI) as a performance metric. Measured in Energy / ft(2) / year, EUI standardizes energy use per square foot, allowing for comparison between many buildings. EUI is a snapshot of building performance over one year's time. It is relatively easy to calculate a building's EUI if their energy usage is known, but in order to gauge performance over a longer period, a constant comparison point must be established so that evaluation is consistent. Called the baseline, this comparison point can be established as a past year, a future goal, or the average performance of similar buildings.
This paper covers the work of the Pittsburgh 2030 District team in formulating an energy performance baseline for each building in Downtown Pittsburgh for purposes of tracking energy use reduction towards the 50% reduction goals of The 2030 Challenge. Pittsburgh is a city with a large stock of aging buildings, without mandatory benchmarking laws, and no single publicly accessible real estate profile by property. Thus, the energy baseline methods included in this paper summarize efforts to create such an aggregated property characteristic database and associated energy baseline for Downtown Pittsburgh; it is the hope of the authors that these efforts will assist similar cities in mirroring 2030 District goal setting and achievement for building energy

T2  - REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS
AB  - U.S. housing accounted for over 22% of the country's total primary energy consumption in 2009, which equated to more than $2000 per household and $229 billion in aggregate expenditure. It appears that these amounts could be reduced substantially, with benefits to both household budgets and the environment's well-being. This paper's goal is to evaluate the alternative mechanisms that could expedite energy efficiency retrofits for U.S. housing.
We begin by evaluating the evidence that significant improvements in the energy efficiency of existing U.S. housing are feasible, both technologically and financially. We compare the relatively optimistic positions taken in McKinsey and Company (2009a,b), EPRI (2009), and Harcourt, Brown, and Carey (2011) versus the less optimistic appraisal in Allcott and Greenstone (2012). We conclude that significant energy savings do appear to be both technologically and financially feasible.
The remainder of the paper considers the bottlenecks that hamper energy-saving investments for the residential sector. We focus on imperfect information and loan market failures as the two key factors. We evaluate the state of the art with respect to scoring and assessment tools for energy-saving investments and the On-Bill, PACE, and Solar programs to facilitate secured loans. The discussion concludes with a series of proposals to overcome the bottlenecks. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Mexico, as in many other countries, the energy crisis has permeated throughout many sectors, particularly the construction sector. Mexico has started to develop and implement actions for the efficient use of energy in order to reduce its consumption. The field of building construction has been particularly active in studying ways to optimize the use of energy, especially regarding energy use indoors. One of the main goals of architectural design is to create the proper indoor conditions so individuals can carry out their daily activities in a comfortable area. Interior space must be designed and calculated to provide a comfortable temperature, appropriate lighting, sound control and ventilation for individuals to carry out their daily activities, but must also address the energy required to provide all these characteristics. In warm dry climates, air-conditioning is responsible for a significant amount of the energy consumed in buildings. Proper building design is necessary in order to reduce energy consumption in this sector. This paper shows the results of simulations with the Energy Plus software to compare the thermal performance of a low-cost housing located in a warm dry climate, Hermosillo, Sonora, with similar construction systems in the envelope. Furthermore, an analysis of the effect of the color exterior finish, represented as a gradual change in the absorptance to solar radiation. The simulation is performed for two conditions of use of low-cost housing, the first condition considers the room without air conditioning and the second considers the air conditioned room. To simulate analyzed housing with air conditioning, is used an air conditioner from the database Energy Plus, corresponding to a Mini-split system compact unit zone cooling with a COP (Coefficient of performance) of 1.83.

AB  - The problem of the efficient management of energy is very important, not only to individual real estate owners, but also to city authorities. Building blocks, districts or the entire organism of a city require the development of various planning documents cultural value analyses, integrated urban planning and even energy optimization plans for each district within a city. It is possible to achieve varying economic and aesthetic effects that generate different costs, at the same time having a differing impact on the quality of a city's public spaces. The urban revitalization of city districts should not come down to the aesthetic layer only, but should also include an improvement in energy efficiency standards, the lowering of building maintenance costs and an overall increase in quality of life, especially within historical districts.

AB  - Purpose - to ensure sustainable development of the territory and incentives to increase the "green" building by improving the competitiveness of the buildings that have higher environmental and economic performance at all stages of the life cycle. A systematic analysis of standards of "green" building and the existing methodologies for life cycle assessment back. Developed and studied environmental-economic model of the life cycle of the building effectively, by identifying and organizing the quantitative and qualitative characteristics and to calculate the total cost of the building. These issues are discussed in this article.
Relevance of the topic. Buildings are used around the world about 40% of the primary energy consumption, 67% of all electricity, 40% of the total raw material and 14% of potable water, and produce 35% of carbon dioxide and about half of all municipal solid waste.
If the entire area of the urban area of the Earth in 1980 was 4.69 mln.km2, it is projected in 2070 it will reach 19 mln.km2, or 12.8% of the total and more than 20% of the land area liveable. Russia, in spite of a significant area of its total land area is highly urbanized state where urban and peri-urban population of 109 million people, or 74% of the total population. The trend of increasing urban population persists because of political, social, economic and other reasons.
For the vast majority of modern cities is an urgent problem crudely-designed urban spaces, poor-quality housing and facilities - poor lighting and ventilation, expensive maintenance and high energy consumption, poor landscaping, ill-conceived transport infrastructure as a result of water pollution of rivers, huge unorganized garbage dumps, decline of biological diversity, the burning of fossil fuels - is only a small part of the illiterate urban policy.
The tasks that need to be addressed to achieve the goal
justification of "green" building, as an effective tool for sustainable development of the territory on which the construction site is located;
identify the benefits of certification of buildings and structures in accordance with "green" standards for investors, property owners, developers, designers and management companies, as well as for the environment, human health and society;
exploration and development of international rating systems for the assessment of objects "green" building, the informational approach to the design and construction of buildings on the basis of the methodology of life cycle assessment;
development of environmental-economic model of the life cycle performance of buildings, taking into account the total cost, determined by quantitative and qualitative indicators and characteristics of "green" building;
study of ecological and economic model of the life cycle of the building, and writing effective algorithm for calculating the present value of owning an apartment building with the introduction of a score of "green" building - the coefficient of "greenness";
development of guidelines on the use of environmental-economic model for the State Corporation - Assistance Foundation and the reform of public utilities;
testing and implementation of the model on real construction sites.

AB  - This paper provides a testimony of the experience and the lessons learned during the design, construction and presentation of a net-zero energy house as part of the 2013 U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) Solar Decathlon competition. The Solar Decathlon is a biennial competition which challenges international collegiate teams to design, build, and operate net-zero energy solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive. Like the Olympic Decathlon, the Solar Decathlon consists of 10 contests: juried contests (engineering, architecture, market appeal, communications and affordability) and measured contests (comfort zone, hot water, appliances, home entertainment and energy balance). The purpose of the competition is both educative - educational experience for the participating students, for the general public, for the building industry and the policy makers - and research oriented - encouraging multi-disciplinary collaboration towards development of new technologies and methods.
The paper discusses the educational experience of the students participating in this international competition, focusing on the engineering undergraduate students. It describes the plan implemented for integrating the Solar Decathlon into the required curricula within the engineering, architecture, and business departments. A project as large and diverse as this one required accommodating curricular development at various levels and within various modes of teaching and learning. Students were encouraged to participate in the process in five ways: design studios, research labs and seminars, special topics, construction, and monitoring. Although the greatest learning experience for the students occurred in the integrated design process - across engineering disciplines, and school of architecture - the student team members also learned how to raise funds, procure materials and construction equipment, and how to interact with one another towards a mutual goal.
The project provided an opportunity for the development and implementation of new educational materials focused on energy efficiency, sustainable building design, solar energy, and power conversion and conditioning technologies. Being part of a large and varied team seeing a project from the preliminary design phase to construction and commissioning, the students were provided with a true multi-disciplinary hands-on opportunity. The opportunity proved to strengthen their technical skills, acquired in the regular curriculum, via integration of theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Moreover, the students were exposed to the perspective and educational styles of professors and students in each represented academic department (electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, architecture, marketing and communications). Organized in a multi-disciplinary format, students were then able to share their strengths across disciplines and contribute to a synthesis of process and product.

AB  - In this paper we investigate variations in the adoption of LEED-certified commercial buildings across 174 core-based statistical areas in the United States. Drawing upon a unique database and using a robust analytical framework, the determinants of the proportion LEED-certified space are modeled. We find that, despite high growth rates, LEED-certified stock accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total commercial stock. The average proportion is less than 1%. A further contribution of the paper is that our concentration measure avoids the biases associated with simple percentage measures that were used in previous studies of this topic. Strongest predictors of the proportion of LEED-certified commercial space in a local market are market size, educational attainment and economic growth. In terms of policy effectiveness, it is found that only a mandatory requirement to obtain LEED certification for new buildings has a significant positive effect on market penetration.

AB  - During the urban development of the communist era in the 1970s, entire neighborhoods of collective dwellings were erected in order to accommodate the wave of people working in the new factories. Standardized and repeated blocks of flats were massively spread throughout the country, offering identical living conditions for all their inhabitants. After the fall of the totalitarian regime, 96% of the inhabitants living in the blocks of flats became owners of their apartments, one of the highest rates of ownership in Europe. Nowadays, almost 60% of the Romanian urban population lives in these so-called grey neighborhoods.
The renovation of these buildings started in the middle of the 90's, as a response to their technical degrading. Most common interventions resulted in the addition of pitched-roofs over the deteriorated flat roofs in order to prevent infiltrations. The real estate development from the 2000s treated the so-called thermal rehabilitation program into a business opportunity by using the slope roof as a livable attic connected to the existing block. As a result, new apartments were added, increasing the urban density levels, but without offering a significant improvement for the existing inhabitants.
The existing Thermal rehabilitation program consists in cladding the facade with a polystyrene base thermal envelope system, and, in some cases, the replacement of the openings with efficient doors and windows. In this case the reduction in energy demands is of 30-40%. The plumbing and heating systems are not included therefore energy management systems are not present.
By contrast, sustainable retrofitting embodies an integrated approach concerning social, economic and environmental aspects. The present article describes the detailed aspects of the two directions of intervening on this specific Romanian building stock. Multiplication represents an advantage for the implementing of both measures (almost 40.000 blocks of flats exist in Romania). The market viability of the two types of intervention is translated in two different industrialization processes detailed in this paper.

AB  - New housing completions constitute a considerable share of the overall housing supply in China's current urban housing markets. We argue that large-scale new housing developments significantly increase energy consumption in the long run, thereby increasing energy prices. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of supply-side housing variables rather than demand-side housing variables on energy prices in Beijing. Supply-side housing variables include level variable (floor space) and growth variable (changes in floor space). We investigated their respective effects on energy prices. We tested for cointegration, Granger causality and weak exogeneity. Tests indicated that new housing completions exerted a positive long-term effect on energy prices. Hence, new housing development needs to improve energy efficiency.

AB  - A household survey in Pakistan is used to examine drivers of more efficient compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) adoption and the impact of CFL adoption on the demand for lighting services. Higher price of a CFL to an incandescent bulb (IB) and limited knowledge about the life span of CFLs versus IBs are found to lower adoption rates by as much as 20%. While CFL adoption increases the technical efficiency of household lighting, the lower cost for lighting services results in estimated rebound effects that decrease potential energy savings by 23% to 35% due to increased brightness and extended hours of use. These findings have important implications for household welfare and cost-benefit tradeoffs for CFL projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper analyses the effect of energy efficiency ratings on the sale and rental prices of properties in the Republic of Ireland. Using the Heckman selection technique we model the decision to advertise the energy efficiency rating of a property and the effect of energy efficiency ratings on property values. Our results show that energy efficiency has a positive effect on both the sales and rental prices of properties, and that the effect is significantly stronger in the sales segment of the property market. We also analyse the effect of energy efficiency across different market conditions and we find that the effect of the energy rating is generally stronger where market conditions are worse.

TI  - Energy benchmarking of commercial buildings: a low-cost pathway toward urban sustainability
AU  - Cox, M

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - US cities are beginning to experiment with a regulatory approach to address information failures in the real estate market by mandating the energy benchmarking of commercial buildings. Understanding how a commercial building uses energy has many benefits; for example, it helps building owners and tenants identify poor-performing buildings and subsystems and it enables high-performing buildings to achieve greater occupancy rates, rents, and property values. This paper estimates the possible impacts of a national energy benchmarking mandate through analysis chiefly utilizing the Georgia Tech version of the National Energy Modeling System (GT-NEMS). Correcting input discount rates results in a 4.0% reduction in projected energy consumption for seven major classes of equipment relative to the reference case forecast in 2020, rising to 8.7% in 2035. Thus, the official US energy forecasts appear to overestimate future energy consumption by underestimating investments in energy-efficient equipment. Further discount rate reductions spurred by benchmarking policies yield another 1.3-1.4% in energy savings in 2020, increasing to 2.2-2.4% in 2035. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions, and conventional air pollution. Achieving comparable CO2 savings would require more than tripling existing US solar capacity. Our analysis suggests that nearly 90% of the energy saved by a national benchmarking policy would benefit metropolitan areas, and the policy's benefits would outweigh its costs, both to the private sector and society broadly.

T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - We take advantage of unusually wide variation in thermal insulation in a sample of house sales to estimate the market value of basic code-level insulation. Insulation levels vary across the houses in our sample because standard practice in New Zealand was to build houses with no thermal insulation prior to implementation of insulation standards in 1978, and the extent of insulation retrofits varies across the sample. The estimated premium on an otherwise similar house insulated to code levels exceeds the cost of installation at construction: insulating to basic code levels at construction passes the market test. The premium instead reflects the higher cost of retro-fit installation. We suspect that price, cost, and performance risk have discouraged widespread code-level retro-fits in this market.

AB  - The cooperative housing sector is directed at low and medium income residents who cannot afford to buy their homes in the regular private market. Due to social housing legislation, it is possible to build cooperative housing below regular market costs and use tax benefits, therefore providing affordable dwellings to their owners. Traditional cooperative housing used to provide less comfort and higher running costs in indoor and domestic hot water heating than in standard construction. However, cooperative housing has started to change its method of traditional construction towards sustainable construction, in order to benefit from the savings on energy consumption and domestic water as well as to provide an improvement as far as the comfort of its residents is concerned. Therefore, in this article, the savings in electricity and natural gas in different building settlements, calculated for Madalena building-sustainable construction-and for Azenha de Cima building-traditional construction-will be presented, according to two different criteria of calculation: efficiency of dwellings at a pre-determined standard level of indoor comfort opposed to real consumptions made by residents. For each building under analysis, an energy audit and further monitoring were brought in, in order to issue an energy evaluation according to the Portuguese energy agency rules. Results showed an expected decrease of the operational costs of natural gas and electricity, obtained by the use of efficient building systems and equipment, as well as a decrease of the payback period for each situation.

AB  - Given the centrality of the price mechanism to resource allocation in market economies, the effect of sustainable construction on real estate prices has become an increasingly important empirical issue for market participants and policy makers in the real estate sector. Drawing upon a sample of approximately 2500 residential building units in Switzerland, this study assesses the effects of buildings' sustainability on their rental prices. In contrast to the vast majority of previous studies that have focused on the price effects of ecolabels, this study investigates the effects of individual sustainability attributes. Overall, we find a positive relationship between the environmental performance of residential buildings and their rental levels. Sustainable building characteristics, especially those which enhance the water efficiency, the health and comfort level and the building's safety and security, have significant positive price effects. It is argued that the unexpected negative relationship between energy performance and rental prices is attributed to the bundling of energy costs and rents in Swiss lease structures.

TI  - The impact of energy performance on single-family home selling prices in Sweden
AU  - Hogberg, L
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to test whether energy performance effects single-family home sale prices. It also examines whether recommendations for supposedly cost-effective energy efficiency measures, by intervention category (construction, installation or operation/control technical measures), are perceived as untapped potential - a real option - that effects sale prices.
Design/methodology/approach - The energy performance measurement and dummy variables for three categories of improvement recommendations are included as explanatory variables in a hedonic regression analysis using transaction data and energy performance certificates data for 1,073 observations.
Findings - Results indicate that better energy performance effects selling prices positively. Energy efficiency recommendations seem to have an impact on sale price; home buyers seem to require a larger "discount" for more complex types of measures.
Research limitations/implications - The sample only includes houses in the Stockholm; so-called sustainable buildings have not been specifically studied; and the heating source has not been accounted for.
Originality/value - The EU energy performance certificates provide new information and measure energy performance more exactly than many earlier (proxy) variables. This is one of the first studies to test the effect of this information, and the first one using Swedish data.

AB  - Energy disclosure laws represent one of the most promising public policy tools to accelerate market transformation around building energy efficiency. For this type of information to have an impact on market behavior, it must be collected, analyzed, and disseminated to support the decision-making processes of each end user and influence both the producers and consumers of building performance data. This paper explores the significance of energy disclosure requirements and outlines a framework for utilizing these new sources of transparent, publicly available information. It presents the mechanisms by which information can alter market behavior in the commercial real estate sector and develops a wiring diagram for the flows of information through the building data ecosystem. It concludes with a discussion of the motivations, metrics, and constraints faced by the various stakeholders in the ecosystem and how these factors influence investment decision models.

T2  - 2013 ASHRAE WINTER CONFERENCE
AB  - Retail buildings are responsible for approximately 18% of energy consumed by commercial buildings in the United States (EIA 2008). They offer a great opportunity for energy savings because retail stores have many similarities, and because large companies can implement successful energy efficiency strategies across their portfolios. Recognizing this potential, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) formed the Commercial Building Partnership (CBP) program to work with select companies in retail and commercial real estate to reduce energy consumption by 30% in existing buildings and 50% in new construction versus ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 (ASHRAE 2004a). The National Renewable Energy Laboratory partnered with Target under the CBP program to design and implement a retrofit of a SuperTarget in Thornton, Colorado. The result was a retrofit design that predicted 37% energy savings over ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004, and 29% compared to existing (pre-retrofit) store consumption. Energy simulations of each efficiency measure played a key role in determining a mix of solutions that would provide the best value and yield the highest savings. The largest savings came from energy-efficient lighting and cooling systems, improved refrigeration, and better control of plug loads. The results of this effort will be carried forward to inform the retrofit of other stores across the nation. Other companies will also be able to use these results to achieve DOE's energy efficiency goals.

T2  - IMPLICATIONS OF A DATA DRIVEN-BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The real estate industry routinely uses specialized information systems for functions, including design, construction, facilities management, brokerage, tax assessment, and utilities. These systems are mature and effective within vertically integrated market segments. However, new questions are reaching across these traditional information silos. For example, buyers may be interested in evaluating the design, energy efficiency characteristics, and operational performance of a commercial building. This requires the integration of information across multiple databases held by different institutions. Today, this type of data integration is difficult to automate and propone to errors due, in part, to the lack of generally accepted building and spaces identifiers. Moving forward, the real estate industry needs a new mechanism to assign identifiers for whole buildings and interior spaces for the purpose of interoperability, data exchange, and integration. This paper describes a systematic process to identify activities occurring at building or within interior spaces to provide a foundation for exchange and interoperability. We demonstrate the application of the approach with a prototype Web application. This concept and demonstration illustrate the elements of a practical interoperability framework that can increase productivity, create new business opportunities, and reduce errors, waste, and redundancy.

AB  - In recent years, the IT infrastructure due to the demand for computing power which used by applications are rapidly growing and modern data centers in cloud computing are hosting a variety of advanced applications. The high energy cost and green-house gas emissions are significant problems that have emerged as results of using large data centers. Thus providing an efficient method to reduce energy consumption by data centers is highly regarded by researchers. In this paper we present a new approach based on Learning Automata for dynamic replacement of virtual machines over data centers to reduce power consumption. Live migration and forcing idle nodes to sleep constitute main policies of this approach. To evaluate the proposed method, the workload is used in the real world. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method significantly reduces the energy consumption However, the efficiency of the system is preserved to a considerable extent.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of the energy efficiency and sustainability of commercial properties on the operating and stock performance of a sample of US REITs, providing insight into the net benefits of green buildings. We match data on LEED- and Energy Star-certified buildings with detailed information on REIT portfolios and calculate the share of green properties for each REIT over the 2000-2011 period. We estimate a two-stage regression model and document that the greenness of REITs is positively related to three measures of operating performance - return on assets, return on equity and the ratio of funds from operations to total revenue. We also document that there is no significant relationship between the greenness of property portfolios and abnormal stock returns, suggesting that stock prices already reflect the higher cash flows deriving from investments in more efficient properties. However, REITs with a higher fraction of green properties display significantly lower market betas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In international and metropolitan real estate markets, it has been detected, for the first time, the growing relevance of green buildings with respect to non-green building. Also, it has been singled out and then quantified through regression analysis a green premium, i.e. a differential in terms of price toward sold real estate units having ecological characteristics along with an energy value (more efficient behavior). The incipient international studies recommend to extend the analysis to unexplored middle-size non-metropolitan (marginal) real estate markets. One of this areas has been studied detecting the first sale of an apartment with energy certification belonging to class B in a building with ecological characteristics. The assessment analysis performed through Market Comparison Approach, MCA, made it possible to detect and then appraise the green premium that is in line with the outcomes of the first and pioneer international studies performed in metropolitan areas.

It meets the implementation of the policies in twelve-five year plan of China: improving Beijing's environment and future sustainable transform on its coal-based energy structure. A survey of the heating way of indemnificatory housing, price-fixed housing and affordable housing in Beijing is proposed. The results show that the heating area using the wall-hung gas boiler in the resident building is 55% of the total heating area in Beijing and 67% of the total heating area in new buildings. Then, the adaptability between the household wall-hung gas boiler heating way and other heating ways is compared. The energy efficiency, initial investment, operating cost and user satisfaction are discussed. The final analysis is then evaluated by a panel of experts to determine its accuracy and potential for use in a greenway development plan of heating way in Beijing.

AB  - In this paper a method that allows to classify homogeneous zones according to the estimated energy consumption for the annual mobility per capita is proposed. With Directive 2002/91/EC, in the UE territory all real estate must have an energy performance certificate. This certification estimates the annual energetic needs of a building and then determines its energetic class identified by a letter from A+ to G. Here it is proposed to apply the same idea to the transport sector and urban planning. This certification will help to increase the performances of the transport system for the benefit of users and environment. Land use and city planning influence the energy consumption, so new plans should be subject to minimum energy performance measures according to local conditions. This will establish minimum levels of energy efficiency that new settlements will have to meet. The proposed methodology, if applied to existing zones will help to identify the least efficient and provides for them measures for improvement. The determination of the class will depend on the energy consumption estimated by simulations of travel throughout the vast area in which the zone under investigation is located. Then we can identify the number of O/D trips for each area of the wide, their traveled distance and mode of transportation. Once estimated, from these data, the per capita consumption for the transport of the inhabitants (of the vast), it is possible define the threshold of transition from one class to another, and then categorize all zones located within it. The proposed classification will be used to vary the costs of urbanization and the taxation of real estate according to the energy performance of the zone. In conclusion, as the class is an indicator easily understood by all, this method will bring local government and public opinion toward more efficient choices and to introduce new design standards.

AU  - Arnold, ME

T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The role of sludge in renewable energy production and the final disposal of sludge are topical issues. The cost of sludge treatment account for a significant share of the total running costs of a WWTP. By increasing the efficiency of sludge treatment, significant savings can be achieved. Savings can be gained e.g. by more efficient energy utilisation of sludge, combined with optimised wastewater treatment processes. In addition to cost efficiency, environmental sustainability of the applied solutions is crucial. The energy balance and green house gas emissions can be used as tools to evaluate the sustainability of sludge treatment options.
This paper presents a case-based comparison of energy balances, green house gas emissions and costs of municipal wastewater sludge process chains based on anaerobic digestion or incineration. Information from existing plants was used for conducting the study. Several utilisation options were covered for biogas energy as well for energy from sludge incineration.
Based on the results, sludge incineration was the most expensive option of the studied scenarios, but justified if the heat generated can be fully utilised e.g. in district heating. Based on costs and energy balances as well as green house gas emissions it is most preferable in anaerobic digestion chains to feed the generated biogas to a gas engine to produce electricity and heat. Moreover, thermophilic anaerobic digestion can improve the overall economy of a WWTP provided that the biogas yield is sufficiently higher than in a mesophilic process. However increased odour is a risk in thermophilic digestion.
The study showed that the most energy efficient process modifications are always very case bound. However the tools developed in this study are generally applicable to waste water treatment plants for similar analyses.

AB  - The Energy Star label program to promote the diffusion of energy efficient home appliances is arguably the most significant government effort to reduce U.S. residential energy consumption. Program effectiveness requires that consumers are aware of the labeling scheme and also change their purchase decisions based on label information. This paper examines the factors associated with consumer awareness of the Energy Star label of recently purchased 'white' major appliances and the factors associated with the choice of Energy Star labeled appliances. The paper finds that household characteristics have a much stronger association with consumer awareness of labels than with the choice of Energy Star appliances. Renting the home. Hispanic ethnicity, being poor or near poor, and living in regions with lower ACEEE scores do, however, decrease the propensity for households to purchase Energy Star appliances. Eliminating these gaps in Energy Star appliance adoption would result in house electricity cost savings of $164 million per year and associated carbon emission reductions of about 1.1 million metric tons per year.

AB  - This paper focuses on the effect of energy performance ratings on appraised capital values, rental values and equivalent yields of UK commercial property assets. The study is based on a cross-section of 708 commercial property assets. Incorporating a range of potential confounding factors such as unexpired lease term, vacancy rate and tenant credit risk, we use hedonic regression procedures to estimate the effect of EPC rating on rental and capital values. The study finds no evidence of a significant relationship between environmental and/or energy performance and rental and capital values. A small subset of 24 BREEAM-rated assets is also tested for significant price effects but a statistically significant effect is only confirmed for equivalent yields. Similarly, there was no evidence that the EPC rating had any effect on Market Rent or Market Value with only minor effects of EPC ratings on equivalent yields. The preliminary conclusion is that energy labelling is not yet having the effects on Market Values and Market Rents that would be expected if high EPC ratings were associated with substantial cost savings that are fully reflected in capital values and/or were readily available and taken into account by prospective tenants and buyers.

AB  - Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) methods prioritize the alternatives of comparative projects quite accurately. Problems arise when there is a need to determine the utility degrees and market values of the project alternatives. This becomes especially important for establishing the market value of real estate property in tender offers. However, the available MADM methods cannot accomplish this. Thus the authors of this article developed the MAMVA method, which permits determining the utility degrees and market values of project alternatives, and also developed a system on the basis of this developed method. This article presents the proposed Multi-Attribute Market Value Assessment (MAMVA) Method and the Decision Support System for Construction and Retrofit Projects (DSS-CRP). It also presents a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and system. The application of the MAMVA Method and DSS-CRP System for prioritizing and for determining the utility degrees and market values of construction and retrofit projects under consideration for financing by the European Economic Area (EEA) and Norway Financial Mechanism Grant made it possible to decrease the amount of requested support.
This article also presents the analysis and comprehensive assessment of the noted construction and retrofit projects. These were performed in consideration of the entire life cycle of a project and of needs satisfaction relevant to all the groups interested in a project. The developed MAMVA Method and DSS-CRP System permit assessing the appropriateness of projects under analysis in conceptual and qualitative forms. This method and system automatically submit the values of the project alternatives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AU  - Frondel, M

T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Since September 2009, Regulation 244/2009 of the European Commission enforces the gradual phase-out of incandescent light bulbs. As of September 2012, only energy-efficient lighting sources will be allowed for sale. Among these are halogen light bulbs, light-emitting diodes (LED), or compact fluorescent light bulbs-often referred to as energy-saving light bulbs. The Commission's justification for the phase-out of conventional light bulbs maintains that a reduction in the electricity consumed will not only lead to lower energy cost for private households and industrial consumers, but at the same time lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This article discusses possible reasons for the slow market diffusion of energy-saving light bulbs and shows that the investment in energy-efficient light bulbs does not necessarily lead to significant cost reductions. Drawing on some illustrative examples, we demonstrate that the use of cheaper incandescent bulbs instead of energy-saving light bulbs can be economically rational in cases of rather low usage times, in which the higher initial purchasing price might only pay off after very long time spans. Furthermore, due to the coexistence with the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), this regulation attains no additional emission reductions beyond those achieved by the ETS alone. We thus conclude that the general ban of incandescent light bulbs is inappropriate and should be abolished by the Commission. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The importance of the built environment from an environmental impact and energy use perspective is well established. High thermal efficiency of the constructed building envelope is a key strategy in the design and construction of buildings which limit use of active space conditioning systems. Australia's current housing stock is thermally poor and national energy performance standards are relatively weak when benchmarked against international best practice. A lack of data has impeded the policy debate and a significant gap in analysis remains a lack of empirical research into the life-cycle cost implications of increased building thermal efficiency, particularly for residential buildings. This paper applies an integrated thermal modeling, life cycle costing approach to an extensive sample of dominant house designs to investigate life cycle costs in a cool temperate climate, Melbourne Victoria. Empirical analysis provides new insights into lifetime costs and environmental savings for volume housing design options and identifies sensitive factors. Results suggest that the most cost-effective building design is always more energy efficient than the current energy code requirements, for the full time-horizon considered. Findings have significant policy implications, particularly in view of present debates which frequently present higher energy efficiency standards as prohibitive from a costs perspective.

AB  - Reducing energy consumption and environmental impacts of homes remains a critical task for researchers and practitioners. Although numerous energy efficient (EE) home strategies have been developed, their adoption across the entire industry has still been limited. Nationwide, only a small number of EE homes have been built under several well-known EE home programs. Therefore, the research question of, "what prevents EE homes from being widely accepted and built?" needs to be addressed and investigated thoroughly. This paper presents the findings-a comprehensive set of barriers and impediments to the wide spread adoption of EE homes-from an on-going effort made by an alliance of researchers, educators, builders, suppliers, appraisers, real estate agents, and other parties associated with the home construction industry. These findings are being used to develop and implement a holistic action plan to advance the cause of EE homes through research, education, and outreach. The provided insights will also help other researchers, educators, practitioners and government agencies re-evaluate the strategies used in promoting EE homes and improve the effectiveness of on-going and future programs.

The Energy Performance Certificate of the real estates should be mandatory in Romania starting with January 1st 2011, date from which no building without this act should be constructed, sold or rent. But when analysing the Romanian legislation you realise that obtaining or using such Certificate is optional.

T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Modern buildings and their HVAC systems are required to be not only energy-efficient but also produce fewer economical and environmental impacts while adhering to an ever-increasing demand for better environment. Research shows that building regulations which depend mainly on building envelope requirements do not guarantee the best environmental and economical solutions. In the current study, a modified multi-objective optimization approach based on Genetic Algorithm is proposed and combined with IDA ICE (building performance simulation program). The combination is used to minimize the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)-eq) emissions and the investment cost for a two-storey house and its HVAC system. Heating/cooling energy source, heat recovery type, and six building envelope parameters are considered as design variables. The modified optimization approach performed efficiently with the three studied cases, which address different shimmer overheating levels, and a set of optimal combinations (Pareto front) was achieved for each case. It is concluded that: (1) compared with initial design, 32% less CO(2)-eq emissions and 26% lower investment cost solution could be achieved, (2) the type of heating energy source has a marked influence on the optimal solutions, (3) the influence of the external wall, roof, and floor insulation thickness as well as the window U-value on the energy consumption and thermal comfort level can be reduced into an overall building U-value, (4) to avoid much of summer overheating, dwellings which have insufficient natural ventilation measures could require less insulation than the standard (inconsistent with energy saving requirements) and/or additional cost for shading option.

AB  - Energy use in the building sector shares a great portion of world energy and accounts for a lot of green house gas. It is necessary to increase energy efficiency in the building sector to reduce energy cost and green house gas emissions. This paper proposes a building energy management system based on ontology, inference rules, and simulation. Ontology modeling has the advantages of information reusability, extensibility, and interoperability. It enables the BEMS to be easily deployed in the field. Building energy simulation helps the inference rules accumulated. The efficiency will be increased in proportional to the number of inference rules. The feasibility of the proposed BEMS model is shown through the pilot system. The proposed model is expected to greatly contribute to the energy saving and the reduction of green house gas emissions.

AB  - Aiming at the problem of "market failure" in the domain of energy efficiency buildings, the principle of asymmetric information is discussed through the economic theory. Then an adverse selection game model of the real estate developers and the energy-saving product manufacturers is brought up in the energy-efficient product market, drawing a conclusion that developers in the consumer class tend to buy some non-energy-saving building product. Through the analysis of the model and the practical examples, a solution - signal display is put forward towards the whole building energy market adverse selection problem. However, the government in providing signals to the platform can not fully grasp the authenticity of the signals provided by the building energy regulation sector and the energy-saving manufacturers and developers. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to carry out the building energy regulation sector re-regulation.

AU  - Grosche, P
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Adequate housing and affordable warmth are essential human needs, the lack of which may seriously harm people's health. Germany provides an allowance to low-income households, covering the housing as well as the space heating cost, to protect people from the consequences of poor housing conditions and fuel poverty. In order to limit public expenditures, payment recipients are required to choose low-cost dwellings, with the consequence that they probably occupy flats with a poor thermal performance. Recipients might therefore exhibit a lower per-square meter rent but in turn are likely to have a higher energy consumption and energy expenditures. Using a large data set of German households, this paper demonstrates that this financially counteracting effect is of negligible magnitude. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, low - carbon economy is energetically promoted all over the world, human being's notions of survival and development have been changed fundamentally with the efficient use of energy, the application of emission-reducing technology, the upgrade of industrial structure and the innovation of systems. There exists great potential of emission reduction in real estate market, to implement less carbon emissions and pollution of the construction industry is important to both controlling energy consumption of buildings and achieving low-carbon economy society, therefore, green real estate attracts more and more attentions of the community. However, in the moment, the green real estate is still in its infancy in China and faces many problems, such as the lack of momentum in investing in energy efficiency housing, without clear awareness of green real estate and lake of effective political stimulus.
This paper firstly analyzes the characteristics of green residence and its current extension pattern in China. It also presents experience reference from developed countries. By means of questionnaire investigation of the potential purchasers and role analysis on developers and government, this paper also puts forward countermeasures to promote the popularization of green residence.

TI  - Two models for benchmarking UK domestic delivered energy
AU  - Summerfield, AJ
AU  - Lowe, RJ
AU  - Oreszczyn, T
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - From publicly available data, two simple models are developed to help identify the trajectory of total delivered energy to UK households and provide benchmarks for the UK domestic sector. Both models can help to inform policy-makers and the public whether delivered energy in the domestic sector is on track and whether the reductions correspond with the expected impact of a more efficient domestic sector. The annual delivered energy, price, and temperature (ADEPT) model uses multiple linear regression to fit consumption data since 1970 (R(2) = 0.76). Findings indicate that with typical recent heating season temperatures of 7 degrees C and at 2005 energy prices, average household delivered energy is estimated at 21.7 MWh (95% confidence interval = 20.8, 22.6). For every 1 degrees C increase in heating season temperature, average household delivered energy drops by approximately 1 MWh/year. Energy price elasticity is estimated at -0.2, so that a 50% rise in energy prices corresponds to an approximate 10% decline in energy demand. To fit quarterly delivered energy data since 1998, a seasonal temperature energy price (STEP) model is also developed using polynomial multiple regression (R(2) > 0.99). At 2005 energy prices, the average household has a minimum power demand of 1.2 kW (including approximately 0.4 kW electricity) at about 16 degrees C, which rises as external temperatures drop to 5 degrees C, where it begins to plateau at approximately 3.8 kW. The average heat loss coefficient is estimated at 240-320 W/degrees C. Both models find no evidence to date to indicate that changes in delivered energy are beyond those expected due to variations in external temperature and energy price. The seasonal model also provides benchmarks for delivered energy as a response to external temperature and energy price that will be useful for a comparison of building performance evaluations with the national stock, without requiring data for a whole year.

AB  - Growing international recognition of the important role of real estate facilities as a business resource has led to a more prominent profile of facilities management (FM) as a business practice and as a profession that can contribute to business success. globalisation of markets and supply chains, rapid technological advances and shifting management priorities have altered both the provision and management of corporate facilities and associated support services. To this end organizations have pursued various strategies aimed at better matching between demand and supply, extended the scope for outsourcing, taken energy efficiency measures and introduced more technology solutions; all efforts to better control and manage facilities occupancy costs. FM performance, both in terms of having appropriate real estate facilities and appropriate support services, are keys to support the achievement of corporate goals. This paper proposes a conceptual model for evaluating variables that are critical in aligning FM to corporate business plans. The model is based on identifying an initial four key alignment variables (business needs, facilities solutions, FM services and FM resources) for which alignment criteria can be developed and used to evaluate the degree of alignment between each pair of alignment variables. Further work is being undertaken to validate these variables and alignment criteria as well as to identify any other alignment variables and associated criteria.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Previous estimates of childhood lead poisoning prevention benefits have quantified the present value of some health benefits, but not the costs of lead paint hazard control or the benefits associated with housing and energy markets. Because older housing with lead paint constitutes the main exposure source today in the US, we quantify health benefits, costs, market value benefits, energy savings, and net economic benefits of lead-safe window replacement (which includes paint stabilization and other measures). The benefit per resident child from improved lifetime earnings alone is $21,195 in pre-1940 housing and $8685 in 1940-59 housing (in 2005 dollars). Annual energy savings are $130-486 per housing unit, with or without young resident children, with an associated increase in housing market value of $5900-14,300 per housing unit, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Net benefits are $4490-5,629 for each housing unit built before 1940, and $491-1629 for each unit built from 1940-1959, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Lead-safe window replacement in all pre-1960 US housing would yield net benefits of at least $67 billion, which does not include many other benefits. These other benefits, which are shown in this paper, include avoided Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, other medical costs of childhood lead exposure, avoided special education, and reduced crime and juvenile delinquency in later life. In addition, such a window replacement effort would reduce peak demand for electricity, carbon emissions from power plants, and associated long-term costs of climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Continuously increasing demand for richer functionality, faster real-time communication, smaller feature size, longer battery life, more elevated security, and higher reliability is pushing the design for portable multimedia applications into the era where a single system is consisted of a general-purpose CPU interacting with several application-specific accelerating components and co-processors to fulfill the ever diverse constraints imposed multi-directionally. The inter-component communication overhead, along with the engineering efforts required to integrate, verify, and validate such heterogeneous systems are scaled disproportionally as the complexity of such systems continue rising skyrocketedly. Moreover, due to limited instruction encoding space and the need to maintain back-ward compatibly in the future designs, designers are often forced to include only a very small subset of the total desired functionalities on chip, despite there can be more than sufficient silicon real estate to incorporate these specialized operation units. This paper proposes a cost-effective technique of incorporating diverse functionalities into a single versatile hardware acceleration unit, called VPU, to replace the conventional ALU on a CPU. The proposed VPU can supply the general-purpose CPU with a rich set of operations, which may supersede some or even all of the heterogeneous cores. The superseded hardware components are removed to reduce the integration and communication overhead. The issues of limited instruction encoding space and future backward compatibility are resolved by our proposed dynamic instruction re-mapping technique, in which the instruction bit fields can be redefined on the fly to allow instruction space reuse at run time.

AB  - The increasing presence of distributed energy resources, information, and intelligence in the electricity infrastructure increases the possibilities for larger economic efficiency of power systems. This work shows the possible cost advantages of applying a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to residential energy systems. MPC can take future information on energy demand and prices into account and might lead to lower energy costs for end consumers. The main objective in this paper is to illustrate the potential for operational cost savings when adopting MPC in the local control of residential energy systems, thereby mainly focusing on micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) systems. We conclude that the pricing regime of household energy has a large influence on potential cost savings.

AB  - In order to realise the potential for energy efficiency in residential areas it requires influencing the many individual house owners that make the decisions. We compare how Swedish energy policy and Swedish energy suppliers influence the house owners in taking decisions about heating systems and house envelope measures. An economic analysis shows how energy policy and electricity cost affects the house owners' economic situation. The house owners' perception is analysed through comprehensive questionnaires, sent out both before and after the implementation of a heating system conversion subsidy and a district heating marketing campaign by an energy supplier. We conclude that a heating system conversion subsidy and electricity tax give relevant incentives to act according to the national policy. We show that the effect on the annual cost of most of the studied policy measures was smaller than the price variations between different energy suppliers. The energy supplier can largely influence both the economic situation and the perceptions of the customers.

AU  - Herter, K
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper investigates how critical-peak pricing (CPP) affects households with different usage and income levels, with the goal of informing policy makers who are considering the implementation of CPP tariffs in the residential sector. Using a subset of data from the California Statewide Pricing Pilot of 2003-04, average load change during summer events, annual percent bill change, and post-experiment satisfaction ratings are calculated across six customer segments, categorized by historical usage and income levels. Findings show that hi.-h-use customers respond significantly more in kW reduction than do low-use customers, while low-use customers save significantly more in percentage reduction of annual electricity bills than do high-use customers-results that challenge the strategy of targeting only high-use customers for CPP tariffs. Across income levels, average load and bill changes were statistically indistinguishable, as were satisfaction rates-results that are compatible with a strategy of full-scale implementation of CPP rates in the residential sector. Finally, the high-use customers earning less than $50,000 annually were the most likely of the groups to see bill increases-about 5% saw bill increases of 10% or more-suggesting that any residential CPP implementation might consider targeting this customer group for increased energy efficiency efforts.

AB  - Continuously increasing demand for richer functionality, faster real-time communication, smaller feature size, longer battery life, more elevated security, and higher reliability is pushing the design for portable multimedia applications into the era where a single system is consisted of a general-purpose CPU interacting with several application-specific accelerating components and co-processors to fulfill the ever diverse constraints imposed multi-directionally. The inter-component communication overhead, along with the engineering efforts required to integrate, verify, and validate such heterogeneous systems are scaled disproportionally as the complexity of such systems continue rising skyrocketedly. Moreover, due to limited instruction encoding space and the need to maintain back-ward compatibly in the future designs, designers are often forced to include only a very small subset of the total desired functionalities on chip, despite there can be more than sufficient silicon real estate to incorporate these specialized function units.
This paper proposes a cost-effective technique of incorporating diverse functionalities into a single multi-purpose, streamlining acceleration unit, named Versatile Processing Unit (VPU), to replace the conventional ALU on a CPU. The proposed VPU can supply the general-purpose CPU with a rich set of streamlined operations, which may supersede some or even all of the heterogeneous cores. The superseded hardware components are removed to reduce the integration and communication overhead. The issues of limited instruction encoding space and future backward compatibility are resolved by our proposed dynamic instruction re-mapping technique, in which the instruction bit fields can be redefined on the fly to allow instruction space reuse at run time.

TI  - CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants' satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building
AU  - Schnieders, E

T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Passive houses offer extended living comfort with only 15-20% of the space heating demand of conventional new buildings while the extra costs of this standard are only about 10% of the total building costs. In the first part of this paper, detailed measurements for 11 "Passive House" projects with more than 100 dwelling units from the EU-funded demonstration project CEPHEUS (Cost Efficient Passive Houses as European Standards) are presented.
All projects exhibit extraordinarily low space heat consumptions. Compared with ordinary, newly erected buildings, 80% of the space heat consumption could be saved. The total primary energy consumption (including household electricity) was less than 50% of that of conventional new buildings. The measurements show that the buildings also offer comfortable indoor conditions in both summer and winter.
Several social research studies revealed that the users are well pleased with their homes. The second part of the paper focuses on low-income tenant's satisfaction in the world's first multi-story Passive Houses in Kassel, Germany. This building contrasts sharply with the "standard" Passive House, occupied by its owners. A 2.5 year study was conducted from spring of 2000 to autumn of 2002. The development of opinions, attitudes, behaviour, and satisfaction over time could be recorded. The building is a clear success, the tenant's satisfaction is high.
It is concluded that this building type fulfils the conditions of sustainability in social, ecological and economic respects and should therefore be disseminated on a larger scale. To this end, the last part of the paper describes the development of the Passive House standard in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, from the first demonstration project in 1991 to about 3500 dwelling units today. The prerequisites for this development are analysed. Finally, the authors give their view about the political possibilities for pushing Passive Houses into the market as well as for stimulating a market pull for this comfortable and energy efficient building type.

AU  - Al-Zubaidi, MS

T2  - IABSE Conference New Delhi, India 2005: ROLE OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS TOWARDS REDUCTION OF POVERTY
AB  - Sustainable building materials, especially natural ones are generally low -cost compared to manufactured materials, thus sustainable building materials are lower in embodied energy and toxicity than man-made ones. They require less processing and are less damaging to the environment. Consequently, traditional architecture, all over the world, depended basically upon building materials available in the contiguous environment. These local materials are better suited to environmental conditions and purchases support area economies, like adobe, stone and palm trunks, which are theoretically renewable besides their efficient thermal performance. Sustainable building materials are usually part of society sustainable development for they often depend on local labor and available raw resources, which means that building with sustainable building materials contribute in housing affordability, offering in the same time, more employment opportunities. This leads to reduce poverty levels in many countries in the world.
This paper aims to study the factor of choosing building materials that conform to the Gulf region, as an entrance for developing the process of facilitated housing, and illustrating the role of its contribution in rationalizing consumption of power sources. Use of sustainable building materials achieves the economic objective, which is reducing the initial and operating costs of housing utilities and making it affordable within the economic power and the same time minimizing air toxicity and environment pollution.

T2  - Energy and the Environment 2004, Vol II
A2  - Frankovic, B
AB  - The concept of an energy independent house intended for rural tourism on islands represents a model for designing houses in. rural areas lacking a developed utility infrastructure network. The high quality of construction and a high level of the external building envelope (including the orientation of the house and an adequate relationship between the surface area and the building's volume) have reduced transmission and ventilation losses to a minimum. Additional insulation of the external building envelope raises the construction costs by 10-12 per cent and reduces heat losses through the house's envelope tenfold (from approximately 150 kWh/m(2) a year to less than 15 kWh/m(2)). The use of renewable energy sources for heating and electricity increases the costs of installing the energy supply system in the house and makes the construction in general more expensive by some 30 per cent. However, taking into account that no conventional heating system (and associated maintenance costs) is any longer necessary, that annual heat consumption of such a house is below 15 kWh/m(2) (total energy consumption is below 40 kWh/m(2)), the concept of a house self-sufficient in terms of energy becomes absolutely cost-effective in the short and in the long run. The system is even more cost-effective if such houses are grouped in villages or settlements of 8-10 houses, when the major part of the energy supply system may be provided from a central source. Viewing the past activities related to deliberations about energy future of the County Splitsko-dalmatinska, an ecological house, self-sufficient in terms of energy, as an element of an autonomous solar village intended for rural tourism on islands is a logical continuation of a practical implementation of research results regarding energy development of the County. Its islands show an extremely great potential for the development of eco-tourism and organic agriculture. An energy independent ecological house, located in a rural area with no utility infrastructure, combined with renewable energy sources, represents a model for a successful fulfilment of strategic development determinants of the County Splitsko-dalmatinska.

AU  - Badescu, V

T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - A passive house is a cost-efficient building that can manage throughout the heating period, due to its specific construction design, with more than 10 times less heat energy than the same building designed to standards presently applicable across Europe. Its extended thermal insulation and enhanced air-tightness removes the need for temperatures higher than 50 degreesC. This makes renewable energy sources particularly suitable for heating, cooling and domestic hot water production. Modeling of renewable energy usage for space heating requires as a preliminary stage the detailed description of the building structure, of the HVAC equipment and of the internal heat sources. This paper shows the main data used to model the thermal behavior of a passive house. Details about Pirmasens Passive House (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany) are given, as for example, the internal heat sources, including electric appliances, heat and humidity released by human bodies, thermal internal facilities as hot and cold water pipes. All these are quantified by using statistically derived data. A detailed time schedule for a standard German family with two adults and two children was prepared. It takes into account the national celebrations, vacation and weekends among others. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With increasing globalisation of the economy, income distribution and consumer preferences are changing. This may impact upon the possibility for low-income families to purchase and utilise energy efficient home appliances.
The aim of the study is to access the present degree of difficulty that low income families in Italy have in purchasing high efficiency refrigerator/freezers and clothes washers.
Results show that, given their substantially lower level of expenditure for household appliances, the higher prices of energy efficient models represent an obstacle for these families in Italy to overcome energy inefficiency and energy poverty. an important input to energy policy. Over two million 600 thousand families, 11.9 percent of the total families in 1999 are estimated to be below the poverty threshold based upon consumption. An independent survey shows that these families possess less technologically advanced models, keeping them for a much longer period of 36 years, more than double the recommended lifetime of 15 years, and four times the national average of nine years. This technical disadvantage is aggravated by the additional operating costs of the more inefficient models. The higher prices of the more efficient models make it difficult for the poor families to afford them. Even at the annualised price of the average refrigerator - belonging to the energy efficiency C class - the annual expenditure of the poor families in Italy is less than half that necessary to purchase this model, consistent with the longer turnover rates. According to latest statistics in 1999, the B model is priced 70% above the C model in Italy, making it very difficult for poor families to purchase the more efficient models. Extrapolating the relative consumption data to other European countries and comparing it to local prices indicates that the situation may be similar in other EU Member States.
The implications for energy and social policy are clear: without some form of public incentive it is unlikely that poor families in Italy will purchase the energy efficient models, remaining in an energy poverty trap for many years to come.

AB  - Biomass can be used for the production of electricity, heat and/or liquid fuels. The energy efficiency, emissions and costs, however, will vary among the different energy carriers produced and the technologies used. In this study, heat production with local, electric heat pumps and biomass-fired pellet boilers in single family houses was analysed. The primary energy sources used are logging residues and crude oil. Diesel is used for the recovery and transportation of logging residues. The electricity required for the heat pump is produced in biomass-fired condensing plants. Cost and fuel consumption as well as CO2, SOx, NOx and HC emissions were calculated for each step in the whole fuel chain. The primary energy use and the emissions of CO2, HC, NOx and SOx are about two limes higher for the pellet boiler system than for the heat pump system. The impact on the emission of CO2, HC and NOx of longer transportation is significant in all systems. The heat production with the heat pump system, however, is more expensive than with the pellet boiler system.

T2  - ENERGY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: IS SUSTAINABLE GROWTH POSSIBLE?, VOLS 1-3
AB  - There are contrasting differences between the household energy consumption in the rural versus urban households. In the rural areas mostly traditional fuels like fuelwood are used which are at available to the households at zero monetary cost. The availability of these traditional fuels like fuelwood is becoming severely restricted due to fast depletion of the local forests and the non-availability of an alternative source of fuel. Based on the consumption expenditure patterns it can be observed that the expenditure on fuel which is at a subsistence level in the beginning will slowly shift towards commercial forms of energy for the sake of convenience and energy efficiency.
The responsiveness of fuel expenditure for changes in income, and the type of fuel used has not been done for All India. This study addresses the shifts in the fuel source with an increase in income, in the framework of energy ladder. Fuel - wise demand for energy was also studied. The energy ladder is a concept used to describe the way in which households will move to more sophisticated fuels as their income increases. For this national sample survey data given by the NSSO for all India rural and urban areas was used. The rounds covered were 27, 28, 32, and 38. Four main fuels were chosen for study, namely, coke, fuelwood, kerosene, and electricity.
It was found that in the rural areas, there was an increase in the use of kerosene and electricity over the rounds. In the urban areas, all the fuels first registered an increase, then decreased in the 38th round, showing the possibility that other fuel sources may have assumed importance in the household sector, like LPG. In the case of expenditure on energy according to income (expenditure) classes, the rural areas registered a decrease in the expenditure with the increase in income. On the other hand, the urban areas showed an increase in the total expenditure on energy with an increase in income.

The community planning process actively incorporated the efforts & commitment of the citizens of Tucson, motivated by a desire to live in such a community. establishing performance standards, there was a struggle to balance high standards with the realities of the housing market. Current practices were examined to develop a baseline to be used as a point of reference for tracking the project.
Energy standards were developed with the assistance of computer modeling to predict energy savings of individual solar and energy efficiency strategies. Costs associated with the strategies were calculated to determine economic feasibility. The end result is the Civano Energy Code, now being used on a voluntary basis. It's widespread use is the next logical step in improving energy efficiency in Tucson homes.
The City of Tucson is implementing a marketing and education program and will participate initially in monitoring the results.

AB  - Energy connection fees and rebates, based on the projected energy load or efficiency of new buildings are currently being considered as a policy option for promoting greater energy efficiency in new construction. In theory, a well designed system of connection fees and rebates could provide states and utilities with a revenue neutral means of creating direct financial incentives for the construction of more energy-efficient buildings. However, a recent case study in New York State found that, in practice, many of the most important features affecting building energy efficiency could not be easily incorporated in connection fee programmes, and that implementation of even a scaled down programme would require a level of administrative commitment and resources which would be difficult to maintain. Instead of implementing connection fee programmes, the authors recommend devoting more resources to an approach based on the combined use of building energy rating systems, enhanced codes with better enforcement, and strategically placed financial incentives and design assistance.

AB  - Residential and commercial buildings comprise approximately forty percent of total energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. Yet, while California spends $1.5 billion annually on energy efficiency programs, limited research has explored how building energy consumption varies within cities, including the social and structural factors that influence electricity and natural gas use. We present results from an analysis of aggregated account-level utility billing data for energy consumption across the over two million properties in Los Angeles County. Results show that consumption in L.A. County varies widely with geography, income, building characteristics, and climate. Several higher-income areas have greater total energy use per building even in cooler climates, while many lower-income regions rank higher for energy use per square-foot. Energy consumption also correlates with building age, which varies widely throughout the region. Our results demonstrate the many complex and interrelated factors that influence urban energy use. While billing data is critical for devising energy efficiency programs that actually realize estimated savings and promote more sustainable cities, opening access to such data presents significant challenges for protecting personal privacy. The presented approach is adaptable and scalable to cities seeking to develop data-driven policies to reduce building energy use.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between residential buildings' energy efficiency labels and household energy expenditure, complementing an existing literature comparing theoretical and actual energy use. Residential building energy performance certificates indicate a theoretical energy use based on standardised assumptions about occupancy and energy service demand and are a market signal about the energy performance of a property. This paper quantifies the empirical relationship between households' expenditure on fuel and building energy performance using household expenditure survey data from the Republic of Ireland. The extent of this relationship, i.e. the size of the elasticity parameter, is of direct relevance to policy makers in the context of energy efficiency and climate policy targets. With building energy efficiency measured as a 15-point scale, we find that each rating decline along the scale is associated with a reduction in energy expenditure of 1.6%.

AB  - Building sector consumes a significant amount of energy worldwide (up to 40% of the total global energy); moreover, by the year 2030 the consumption is expected to increase by 50%. One of the reasons is that the performance of buildings and its components degrade over the years. In recent years, energy benchmarking for government office buildings, large scale public buildings and large commercial buildings is one of the key energy saving projects for promoting the development of building energy efficiency and sustainable energy savings in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions and conventional air pollution. This paper focuses on energy benchmarking for shopping centers in Gulf Coast Region. In addition, this paper will analyze a sample of shopping centers data in Gulf Coast Region (Dubai, Ajman, Sharjah, Oman and Bahrain). It aims to develop a benchmark for these shopping centers by highlighting the status of energy consumption performance. This research will support the sustainability movement in Gulf area through classifying the shopping centers into: Poor, Usual and Best Practices in terms of energy efficiency. According to the benchmarking analysis in this paper, the shopping centers best energy management practices in the Gulf Coast Region are the buildings that consume less than 810 kW h/m2/yr, whereas the poor building practices are the centers that consume greater than 1439 kW h/m2/yr. The conclusions of this work can be used as a reference for shopping centres benchmarking with similar climate. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151630012X]

AB  - Sustainable housing development is essential for achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. However, amid increasing housing deficits, investing in sustainable housing is widely perceived as a risky venture among policymakers and potential developers. This study explores the risk factors that hinder sustainable housing in developing economies using Ghana as a case study. Through a comprehensive literature review, a list of 30 risk factors was established and categorized into five thematic groups. These factors and groups were used to conduct a questionnaire survey among professionals in the Ghanaian housing market to assess progress on achieving sustainable development goals in housing and the risk factors that affect these. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) analysis conducted on risk factors revealed that 'financing-related' is the most critical risk category followed by 'procurement-related', 'design and construction', 'operation and maintenance' and 'political-related' risk factors. By prioritizing the risk categories, the findings apprise policymakers and practitioners of the risk factors that require more attention to achieve sustainable housing development. Additionally, the study stipulates measures for mitigating critical risks and for promoting efficient eminent domain on land, energy efficient retrofitting, transparent procurement, effective contractual strategies and efficient co-production and co-designing for sustainable housing development.

This study examines the financial performance of these types of properties. With few exceptions, over the past 10 years they had net operating incomes, market values, price appreciation, and total returns that were higher or the same as conventional properties, with lower cap rates. The findings reveal that responsible property investing can be practiced without diluting returns and can potentially yield higher profits for developers and investors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AU  - Laquatra, Joseph
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - In cases in which indigenous resources comprise a small amount of a state's energy supplies, money spent on energy is transferred to export economies, reducing local spending on goods and services.  Prevention of this transfer via conservation increases household disposable income, which in turn, impacts areas like the local tax base, sales, and jobs.  It follows that a strong relationship can exist between energy efficiency and economic development.  In some areas, optimal energy conservation can be achieved without government intervention due to market incentives.  Nevertheless, institutional barriers in the rental sector contribute to a lack of thermal integrity in structures often inhabited by those who can least afford energy price increases.  The problems that are associated with achieving energy efficiency in rental housing are reviewed, and the approaches used by local governments to overcome barriers are reported.  The experience of Ithaca, New York, serves as an example.

AB  - In line with global trends towards energy efficiency, Dubai's Government introduced Al Sa'fat Green Building Rating System (GBRS) to reduce the energy intensity of its building sector. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Al Sa'fat with emphasis on building energy performance, shedding light on its effectiveness, limitations, and techno-economic potential. Following a comparison of Al Sa'fat to international and regional GBRSs, a detailed energy-efficiency analysis is conducted using building performance simulations applied to local residential and commercial building archetypes. The benefits of adopting Al Sa'fat at the urban scale are then estimated using a macro techno-economic analysis. Results confirm the potential of Al Sa'fat in curbing current consumption patterns with energy savings ranging from 22% for hotel buildings to 63% for single-family villas. The anticipated monetary savings from adopting Al Sa'fat in Dubai are equally significant and could exceed USD 100 Billion over the next 25 years. Finally, recommendations are made to overcome critical limitations of Al Sa'fat, including the minimal emphasis on water efficiency measures and limited differentiation between its current certification levels (i.e., bronze, silver, gold, and platinum), which could discourage building owners and developers from pursuing high certification levels.

AB  - Increased demand for urban living, financial incentives for redevelopment, and conducive planning regulations are leading to significant commercial building reuse. This trend represents an opportunity to upgrade the energy performance of the existing building stock in older, more walkable downtowns and to achieve preservation goals. Some advocates of building reuse resist imposing the cost of energy improvements on associated projects, while many energy efficiency advocates do not distinguish how the opportunities and constraints differ between new and existing buildings. Building code officials experience this tension when reviewing improvements to existing buildings, and many find that sections of the widely adopted International Energy Conservation Code are pragmatically unenforceable. In this study we examine the existing-building energy challenge using a mixed-methods approach within one region as well as a national-level analysis of governmental data. The authors characterize promising regulatory strategies including exempting historic buildings (which is the status quo), exempting smaller buildings and less energy-intensive occupancies and systems, and creating simple lookup tables that provide succinct guidance to redevelopers and code officials. Code officials enforce longstanding life-safety codes more assiduously than they do the newer energy codes, and these codes need revisions to make them more cost effective and enforceable. A better understanding and implementation of building energy codes can have positive implications for both energy performance and downtown revitalization. Success depends on better managing interdependencies among the national policy objective of energy efficiency, the ubiquitous local planning objective of downtown revitalization, and the bureaucratic challenges of regulating construction in existing buildings. Planners should bring code officials into adaptive reuse projects early.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Realising energy efficiency opportunities in new commercial office buildings is an easier task than retrofitting older, mid-tier building stock. As a result, a number of government programs aim to support retrofits by offering grants, upgrades, and energy audits to facilitate energy efficiency opportunities. This study reports on a state government program in Victoria, Australia, where the uptake of such offerings was lower than expected, prompting the program team to consider whether targeting facilities managers (FMs), rather than building owners, might be a better way of delivering the program. The influences and practices of FMs that impact on their ability to be advocates for energy efficiency were explored. The results revealed that complex building ownership arrangements, poor communication skills, isolation from key decision making processes, a lack of credible business cases and information, split incentives, and the prospect of business disruptions can all impact on FMs' ability to drive organizational change. Future program efforts should continue to interrogate the social context of retrofits in mid-tier buildings, including other influences and influencers beyond FMs, and adapt accordingly.

AB  - Досліджено сучасні тенденції розвитку житлового будівництва України в умовах істотного впливу системних соціально-економічних негараздів та чинників нестабільності. Виявлено низьку ефективність фінансово-кредитних механізмів, необхідних для вирішення житлових проблем населення та недостатню активність державних структур у сфері нового будівництва та модернізації застарілого житлового фонду. Встановлено, що потреба у доступному житлі залишається в країні доволі високою через незадовільні умови проживання населення, низькі стандарти житлової забезпеченості та якість житлових приміщень. Житлова проблема в Україні не знаходить вирішення протягом багатьох років, зберігаються високі соціальні очікування щодо цього у зв'язку з необхідністю оновлення житлового фонду. Попри зростання деяких показників житлової забезпеченості, в Україні зберігається значно вищий рівень перенаселеності житлових приміщень у порівнянні з країнами ЄС. Визначено, що нестабільність макроекономічної ситуації в країні, значні боргові зобов'язання перед європейськими партнерами стримують розвиток ринку нерухомості та модернізацію застарілого житла. Проте сучасне житлове будівництво розвивається завдяки поєднанню різних технологій, зростанню заінтересованості інвесторів у новому будівництві. У зв'язку з цим досліджено специфіку сучасних технології будівництва висотних будинків (цегляне, панельне, монолітно-каркасне, монолітне та збірне монолітно-каркасне) як фактору формування житлових умов населення, виявлено їхні переваги та недоліки в аспекті основних технічних і вартісних характеристик, а також доцільних сфер застосування. Визначено напрями розвитку житлового будівництва, зміни основних параметрів житла та рівня забезпечення ним населення країни. Узагальнено та систематизовано європейський досвід житлового будівництва та можливі джерела стимулювання його розвитку. Виявлено зміни на ринку нерухомості України за останні роки, насамперед у сегменті первинної нерухомості, зокрема зростання середньої житлової та загальної площі нових багатоповерхових забудов, підвищення інтересу інвесторів до зведення нових житлових комплексів. Установлено, що найвищі темпи введення в експлуатацію житлової нерухомості зберігаються у Києві та Київській області, містах Одесі та Львові. Розглянуто проблеми енергоефективності та екологічності будівництва в контексті можливостей поліпшення житлових умов населення, визначено напрями й шляхи їхнього розв'язання.

AB  - The UK Government has unveiled an ambitious retrofit programme that seeks significant improvement to the energy efficiency of the housing stock. High quality data on the energy efficiency of buildings and their related energy demand is critical to supporting and targeting investment in energy efficiency. Using existing home improvement programmes over the past 15 years, the UK Government has brought together data on energy efficiency retrofits in approximately 13 million homes into the Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), along with annual metered gas and electricity use for the period of 2004-2007. This paper describes the HEED sample and assesses its representativeness in terms of dwelling characteristics, the energy demand of different energy performance levels using linked gas and electricity meter data, along with an analysis of the impact retrofit measures has on energy demand. Energy savings are shown to be associated with the installation of loft and cavity insulation, and glazing and boiler replacement. The analysis illustrates this source of 'in-action' data can be used to provide empirical estimates of impacts of energy efficiency retrofit on energy demand and provides a source of empirical data from which to support the development of national housing energy efficiency retrofit policies.

AB  - Green and energy-efficient technology and certification diffusion into the housing market could be significantly attenuated by limited or missing information. In this paper, we analyze this problem and respond to the question ''what diffusion patterns would we expect based on the problem of valuation of green homes in the absence of comparable attribute data supporting their value proposition?'' Further, we identify the problem in the context of the diffusion theory and the condition of inadequate information about the performance of these innovations. High-performance homes reflect green building innovations that involve non-trivial costs. Diffusion theory is a hypothesis used to outline the challenges faced by early-stage innovations, including those faced as they move from early-stage markets across Moore's chasm into more mainstream markets.

AB  - Home buyers and policymakers are becoming more conscious about the benefits that green building features can provide society. This has led to the adoption of green building and sustainable design and construction programs in a growing number of cities in the United States. In this paper, we describe the types of data typically available for capturing green features in residential research, which can be used in hedonic pricing models. We describe how GIS technology and a jurisdiction's mandatory policies can be used to obtain reliable green data. We demonstrate how to combine data on sustainability-related amenities to capture the association between green features and house prices. Following our suggestions should help researchers avoid making erroneous inferences and lead to more reliable estimates of how green amenities are associated with residential home transaction prices.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relation between energy factor markets, leasing structures, and the transaction prices of office buildings in the U.S. We employ a large sample of 15,133 office building transactions between 2001 and 2010. In addition to building characteristics, we also include information on the operating expenses, net operating income, and market capitalization rates at sale to estimate an asset-pricing model for commercial office real estate assets. A further set of important controls in our analysis is the forward/futures contract prices for electricity and natural gas. We also include weather metrics for each building’s location and sale date. Our final set of controls includes information on the dominant contractual leasing structure of the buildings. Our empirical results suggest that Energy Star labels do not explain additional variance in property prices once the key asset-pricing factors of expenses, income and market capitalization rates are included. By contrast, energy-factor market prices, the shape of the energy forward price curves, and weather metrics are consistently significant determinants of office building transaction prices, suggesting that commercial office building prices are exposed to shocks in these markets.

AB  - India is expected to add 40 billion m2 of new buildings till 2050. Buildings are responsible for one third of India's total energy consumption today and building energy use is expected to continue growing driven by rapid income and population growth. The implementation of the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) is one of the measures to improve building energy efficiency. Using the Global Change Assessment Model, this study assesses growth in the buildings sector and impacts of building energy policies in Gujarat, which would help the state adopt ECBC and expand building energy efficiency programs. Without building energy policies, building energy use in Gujarat would grow by 15 times in commercial buildings and 4 times in urban residential buildings between 2010 and 2050. ECBC improves energy efficiency in commercial buildings and could reduce building electricity use in Gujarat by 20% in 2050, compared to the no policy scenario. Having energy codes for both commercial and residential buildings could result in additional 10% savings in electricity use. To achieve these intended savings, it is critical to build capacity and institution for robust code implementation.

TI  - An empirical comparison of voluntary and mandatory building energy performance disclosure outcomes
AU  - Gabe, Jeremy
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - In 2010, the federal Australian government mandated the disclosure of energy performance ratings in advertisements for sale or lease of large commercial office properties. Prior to 2010, participation in the rating scheme was voluntary. This study first develops a theoretical model of mandatory disclosure policy effectiveness. Then, with a dataset of all ratings since inception of the voluntary regime in 1999, it tests the expectation that initial voluntary adopters have a greater tendency towards environmental stewardship and are more likely to manage and invest in environmental performance improvements, potentially dampening the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure policy. However, multiple statistical models of certification are unable to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in energy efficiency outcomes between the mandatory and voluntary adopters at equivalent stages. For urban policymakers, the extrapolation of voluntary adopter performance appears to be a good -- perhaps even conservative -- estimation of mandatory energy performance disclosure outcomes.

AU  - Alamel, Alexis
T2  - Area
AB  - With the growing number of students in higher education, the student housing market has been becoming increasingly competitive and diversified. This intensification has led housing providers to supply all‐inclusive energy packages (i.e., the inclusion of electricity, gas, and water in the rent cost) to their tenants as a selling point. By connecting the geographies of students and energy, this paper aims to assess the magnitude of all‐inclusive energy packages and its effects on students’ residential choices. Based on an online survey distributed to students at Loughborough University (UK), the paper shows that 80% of housing occupied by students is energy‐inclusive. These rental commodities are strongly considered by students, particularly new university entrants, in their housing choices, 70% of whom considered all‐inclusive rent to be an important factor in their residential choice. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that all‐inclusive energy packages are extensively provided throughout the student housing market: from the low‐energy efficient houses in multiple occupancy to the newly developed purpose‐built student accommodation. Finally, the paper underpins how providing energy‐inclusive rent tends to produce energy inequities by shielding some students from being in fuel poverty.

T2  - Journal of Environmental Economics and Management
AB  - Evidence suggests that rental properties are often associated with lower levels of energy efficiency than owner-occupied buildings. Policy makers are increasingly concerned about this energy efficiency gap. In this paper, we investigate the energy investments made and the market efficiency gains associated with different policy interventions at the point of lease. We introduce key features of the housing rental market in the laboratory and examine four policy options: mandatory information on energy efficiency, voluntary information, mandatory minimum standards, and a 'cost-share' treatment (i.e., landlords pay a share of the tenants' energy bill). We find that enabling landlords to post the energy efficiency of their properties increases investment in energy efficiency. Voluntary information achieves efficiency levels comparable to those under a mandatory programme but may lead to lower levels of tenant participation. Mandatory minimum standards lead to higher investments in energy efficiency, but also reduce the number of properties available for lease. Cost-sharing leads to low market efficiency levels, perhaps due to the uncertainty landlords face regarding the energy bill of their tenants. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Among these programs, we found that the implementation of building codes provide by far the largest savings opportunity, leading to an overall 17% reduction in overall space heating and cooling demand relative to the baseline. Second are energy efficiency labels with 6%, followed by reductions of losses associated with district heating representing 4% reduction and finally, retrofits representing only about a 1% savings.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The five Nordic countries have aggressive climate and energy policies in place and have already emerged to be leaders in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Denmark is renowned for its pioneering use of wind energy, Finland and Sweden bioenergy, Norway hydroelectricity and Iceland geothermal energy. All countries aim to be virtually "fossil free" by 2050. This study explores the Nordic energy transition through the lens of three interconnected research questions: How are they doing it? What challenges exist? And what broader lessons result for energy policy? The study firstly investigates the pathways necessary for these five countries to achieve their low-carbon goals. It argues that a concerted effort must be made to (1) promote decentralized and renewable forms of electricity supply; (2) shift to more sustainable forms of transport; (3) further improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings; and (4) adopt carbon capture and storage technologies for industry. However, the section that follows emphasizes some of the empirical barriers the Nordic transition must confront, namely political contestation, technological contingency, and social justice and recognition concerns. The study concludes with implications for what such historical progress, and future transition pathways, mean for both energy researchers and energy planners.

TI  - ENERGY TAX POLICY: ISSUES IN THE 114TH CONGRESS *
AU  - Sherlock, Molly F
AU  - Stupak, Jeffrey M
T2  - Current Politics and Economics of the United States, Canada and Mexico
AB  - A number of energy tax provisions expired at the end of 2014. Expired provisions include those that support renewable electricity (the production tax credit (PTC)), provisions that support energy efficiency in both residential and commercial buildings, and tax credits for certain biofuels and other alternative fuels. Like the 113th Congress, the 114th Congress may choose to address expired energy tax provisions. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (P.L. 113-295), enacted late in the 113th Congress, temporarily extended, through 2014, most expired energy tax provisions. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) proposes extending expired energy tax provisions for two years, through 2016. Energy tax policy may also be considered as part of comprehensive tax reform legislation. A base-broadening approach to tax reform might consider the elimination of various energy tax expenditures in conjunction with a reduction in overall tax rates. This was the approach taken in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1), introduced late in the 113th Congress by then-Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Dave Camp. Alternative revenue sources, such as a carbon tax, may also be evaluated as part of the tax reform process. The Obama Administration has also proposed a number of changes to energy tax policy as part of its annual budget proposal. In the past, the Administration has proposed repealing a number of existing tax incentives for fossil fuels, while providing new or expanded incentives for carbon sequestration, alternative and advanced technology vehicles, renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and advanced energy manufacturing. Energy tax policy involves the use of one of the government's main fiscal instruments, taxes (both as an incentive and as a disincentive) to alter the allocation or configuration of energy resources and their use. In theory, energy taxes and subsidies, like tax policy instruments in general, are intended either to correct a problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some economic (efficiency, equity, or even macroeconomic) objective. The economic rationale for government intervention in energy markets is commonly based on the government's perceived ability to correct for market failures. Market failures, such as externalities, principal-agent problems, and informational asymmetries, result in an economically inefficient allocation of resources-in which society does not maximize well-being. To correct for these market failures governments can utilize several policy options, including taxes, subsidies, and regulation, in an effort to achieve policy goals. In practice, energy tax policy in the United States is made in a political setting, determined by fiscal dictates and the views and interests of the key players in this setting, including policymakers, special interest groups, and academic scholars. As a result, enacted tax policy embodies compromises between economic and political goals, which could either mitigate or compound existing distortions.

TI  - Investigation of the thermal performance of coconut fibre composite with aluminium reflector cooling roofs
AU  - Vinod, Kumar V
T2  - Environment, Development and Sustainability
AB  - Global warming and depletion of petroleum resources have made the scientists to focus on new passive cooling techniques to reduce the indoor temperature of residential and commercial buildings. This paper explores the benefits of using coconut fibre composite as a passive cooling roof and quantifies those benefits in terms of heat flow changes through field experiment and compares them to the base case of standard roof in arid regions. The research also focussed on the usage of this material in combination with radiation reflectors such as aluminium and the effect of air gap between coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector on the energy efficiency of the buildings. Experimental investigation showed a substantial reduction in room air and concrete roof slab temperature of coconut fibre composite with aluminium reflector room in comparison with the conventional roof. A maximum reduction of 5.99 °C (16.59%) and 8.39 °C (23.8%) were observed in room air and roof slab temperature of coconut fibre composite–aluminium roof with an air gap of 40 cm between them. It was also observed that as the air gap between coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector is increased, the room air and roof slab temperature were reduced due to enhanced convective cooling. Compared to a standard roof, the indoor air temperature of coconut fibre composite roof was reduced by a maximum of 2.2 °C (5.86%), 2.9 °C and 5.99 °C (16.59%) for 0, 20 and 40 cm air gap between the coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector, respectively. It is convincingly demonstrated that the coconut fibre composite roof with aluminium reflector can significantly affect the indoor air and roof surface temperature of the roofs during the hot summer days.

AB  - The energy efficiency of existing commercial buildings is more challenging to regulate and improve than the energy efficiency of new constructions. In 2011 and 2012, the Chinese Government selected four cities -- Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and Chongqing -- to implement pilot commercial building energy efficiency retrofit program. Based on site surveys and expert interviews in these pilot cities, this research conducted a comparative analysis on incentive policies of local city level. The analysis results show that policy designs of existing commercial buildings should be further improved. The aspects that influence the implementation effect in the future, such as subsidy level, installments, and business model promotion, should be specified in the policy clauses. Referring to the technical solution and cost-benefit in Chongqing, we found that lighting system is the most common retrofit objects while envelope system is the least common one. And the subsidy incentive is greatest for educational buildings, followed by office buildings. In the end, we further discussed the problems and obstacles in commercial building retrofit market, and provided a series of recommendations.

AU  - Hope, Alexander John

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The UK's housing stock generates approximately 27% of the country's total annual carbon emissions. In light of the legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions, new housing is subject to a tightening of regulations governing energy demand and efficiency resulting in a gradual improvement in carbon emissions. The question is how to achieve the deep carbon emission reductions from existing domestic properties, of which 75% will still be in use in 2050. Government has sought to provide incentives to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their households, and mandate improvements in socially rented housing using a range of fiscal measures, most recently the 'Green Deal'. There has however been little consideration of the 18% of UK households who privately rent their home, a tenure that is growing fast. The aim of this research is to investigate the factors that influence private sector landlords when considering energy efficiency improvements to their tenanted homes. The results indicate that government policy has consistently failed to engage private sector landlords in the issue of energy efficiency and thus measures must be taken to understand the motivations of landlords in order to design effective incentives and interventions.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The China Design Standard for Energy Efficiency in public buildings (GB 50189) debuted in 2005 when China completed the 10th Five-Year Plan. GB 50189-2005 played a crucial role in regulating the energy efficiency in Chinese commercial buildings. The standard was recently updated in 2014 to increase energy savings targets by 30% compared with the 2005 standard. This paper reviews the major changes to the standard, including expansion of energy efficiency coverage and more stringent efficiency requirements. The paper also discusses the interrelationship of the design standard with China's other building energy standards. Furthermore, comparisons are made with ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 to provide contrasting differences in efficiency requirements. Finally recommendations are provided to guide the future standard revision, focusing on three areas: (1) increasing efficiency requirements of building envelope and HVAC systems, (2) adding a whole-building performance compliance pathway and implementing a ruleset based automatic code baseline model generation in an effort to reduce the discrepancies of baseline models created by different tools and users, and (3) adding inspection and commissioning requirements to ensure building equipment and systems are installed correctly and operate as designed.

T2  - Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics
AB  - This paper analyzes the transaction prices of green buildings assessed on the basis of multiple green factors. Our theoretical model demonstrates that the initial green premium can be negative but becomes positive as the building ages if a green building has a higher life-cycle cost and a longer economic life. Our empirical analysis of green condominiums in Tokyo confirms this prediction. We additionally find that the longer-life design is associated with a price premium, but the use of renewable energy and recycled materials and water is associated with price discounts. The price discounts are interpreted as the capitalization of a greater life-cycle user cost.

AB  - The building energy efficiency labeling (BEEL) scheme has been adopted in China since 2008. However, until now, its effect on the actual building energy efficiency has not been accurately established. The objective of this study was to investigate this effect through a case study in Shanghai, China. Additionally, by performing a thorough review, potential barriers for implementing the BEEL scheme in major areas of China were analyzed. The results indicated that 1) the energy use intensity of labeled commercial office buildings in Shanghai followed a normal distribution, with an average value of 79.14 kWh/(m2a); 2) the energy-saving rate and energy consumption exhibited an inversely proportional relationship for residential buildings, but this relationship was not applicable for commercial office buildings; 3) for Shanghai, ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) and variable refrigerant volume systems are more appropriate for commercial office buildings, and GSHPs and split air conditioners are more useful for residential buildings. The potential barriers were classified into three main categories-technical, political, and awareness-and corresponding solutions were proposed. The authors hope that this study can promote the adoption of the BEEL scheme in China.

TI  - Low hanging fruit? Regulations and energy efficiency in subsidized multifamily housing
AU  - Reina, Vincent J
AU  - Kontokosta, Constantine
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The U.S. government has invested in multifamily housing through an array of subsidized housing programs. These programs provide a venue for understanding how regulations governing multifamily housing can affect an owner's incentive to make energy efficient investments, and a tenant's desire to reduce their energy consumption levels. This paper empirically tests the impact of subsidized housing regulations on the energy efficiency of multi-family housing for low-income households. We begin by constructing a unique database that integrates actual energy use with physical, socioeconomic, and regulatory characteristics of all large multifamily properties in New York City, focusing on whether a property receives a federal rental subsidy. We employ multivariate regression models to examine the factors that influence energy consumption in multi-family buildings and compare subsidized housing to market-rate housing, controlling for a range of building and household characteristics. We find that subsidized properties are associated with higher energy consumption than similar market-rate properties and, of the subsidized housing programs, Public Housing tends to consume the most energy. Our results suggest that despite the potential for retrofitting multifamily properties, and associated cost, energy, and carbon emissions savings, regulatory factors constrain investment and consumption decisions in the case of subsidized properties. Reducing energy use in subsidized housing, therefore, rests on modifying existing regulations.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - In the last 30 years, voluntary and mandatory environmental or energy certification schemes have been introduced in the building sector in most developed countries. During the last decade, in Brazil, the document Energy Efficiency Rating Technical Quality Regulations for Commercial, Service and Public Buildings (RTQ-C) was introduced to classify buildings according to their energy efficiency level. This paper aims to assess how Brazilian RTQ-C could learn from the European Union (EU)'s experience of implementing the Directive 2010/31/EU. The implementation of the RTQ-C in Brazil has been examined and compared with the EU's Directive. Technical, economic and social issues as well as barriers and challenges behind the initial stage of the Directive 2010/31/EU implementation were examined. The difficulties and weaknesses of the calculation methodology, scope and labelling of the Brazilian RTQ-C regulations, and potential areas that require further research have been identified and summarised. In order to increase the impact of RTQ-C regulations, improvements to the existing calculation methodology and tools, provision of numerous supporting measures, such as an increase in training, education, public awareness and incentives, and enforcement through building regulations or standards are essential. The valuable experience from the EU's implementation of the Directive could be used to guide the development of energy policies and certification regulations in Brazil.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to test for the persistence of the landlord-tenant energy efficiency problem in the residential rental property market in the presence of information on property energy performance. To do this, we compare the efficiency of rental and non-rental properties using a combination of Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) and parametric regression. We use a sample of 585,578 residential properties in the Republic of Ireland - a region that legally requires rental properties to display energy performance certificates when advertised. The findings suggest that the landlord-tenant problem is present in the Irish rental market but that it is not uniform across locations, indicating the influence of other factors. To explore this further, we exploit the regional variation in rental property prices. We find a larger difference between rental and non-rental properties' energy efficiency in markets with scarcity in rental property supply. In addition, we are able to take advantage of a unique trait in building design to compare rental and non-rental properties which were identical at the time of their construction. The findings from this sub-group mirror our finding for the sample as a whole.

AB  - There is significant potential for reducing energy use and emissions from buildings through energy efficiency retrofits. However, a number of barriers, including long payback periods and uncertainties around business models and technologies, restrict large scale implementation. A recent joint project, piloting green energy schemes and low-carbon investments in public and commercial buildings in the Changning district of Shanghai, China, indicated opportunities to break through these barriers. This study conducted a cost benefit analysis to investigate how an innovative combination of financial and non-financial supported retrofits, and could serve as a model for other urban areas. In total, 44 retrofit sub-projects were carried out and achieved energy savings of 30,217 tons of coal equivalent. The average payback period was 2.43 years, and with subsidies was further reduced to 1.79 years. The Changning Low Carbon Office played a critical role in coordinating and supporting the uptake of retrofit measures but non-economic factors continue to restrict investment by financial institutions and the implementation of retrofits on a larger scale.Key policy insightsPublic and commercial building retrofits in Shanghai are found to generate commercially acceptable payback periods while having achieved significant energy and emissions reductions.Subsidies from the city and district governments significantly reduced the payback periods of energy efficiency retrofits, but may also crowd out investment by financial institutions.The Changning Low Carbon Office has coordinated energy efficiency retrofitting efforts, provided access to information, helped to connect investment funds with project opportunities and support project management.Achieving the deeper retrofits needed to achieve China’s climate targets may require more substantial financial incentives.

AB  - Sustainability alliance networks offer a collaborative governance strategy to address both environmental and societal challenges too large for any single organization. While alliance networks, and particularly sustainability alliances, have been studied in a number of contexts, few alliances have been explored under the context of commercial building energy use—a sector with a multitude of policy, organizational, and technical barriers to the deployment of innovative energy‐ and cost‐saving strategies. In this research, we articulate a framework wherein organizations can assume varying roles across an alliance network based on the organizations' objectives, organizational resources, and the relationships or ties formed with other alliance members. Further, we show that particular roles within one alliance network have implications for the types of knowledge gained and the knowledge shared across the network. Our mixed‐method study draws from several data sources, employs analytic induction, and is supplemented by social network analysis in order to examine an energy efficiency‐focused sustainability alliance comprised of a broad coalition of stakeholders, including US government agencies, federally funded research laboratories, private firms, and trade associations. We develop a typology for six types of organizational roles identified in an energy efficiency alliance network—each role possessing varying implications for the organization's access to and sharing of knowledge.

AB  - It is widely recognized that the adoption of energy saving innovations can induce an increase in the usage of the corresponding technologies and thus can possibly increase energy consumption. Among other concerns is that uncertainties regarding the magnitude of this "rebound effect" can deter policy makers from promoting energy efficiency. This paper analyzes the rebound effects of the adoption of energy efficient technologies in commercial buildings. Based upon a structural model of technology adoption and subsequent energy demand at the building level, the empirical results are that energy efficiency can reduce electricity use by about 35 % and natural gas consumption by about 50 %.

T2  - Journal of the Japanese and international economies
AB  - Using a unique transaction database of condominiums in the Tokyo metropolitan area and a hedonic analytical framework, we find that eco-labeled buildings command a small but significant premium on both the asking and transaction prices. This finding is consistent with results from other countries but in contrast to these studies, the present analysis also incorporates buyer characteristics which provide further information on the sources of demand for eco-labeled real estate. A separate estimation by subgroups reveals that the price premium is primarily driven by wealthier households that exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay for eco-labeled condominiums, both as a total amount and as a fraction of the total sales price. Less affluent households are also shown to pay higher prices for the eco label but the effect is less pronounced. The results indicate that capitalised utility bill savings are likely to account for a large proportion of the observed premium but the higher premium paid by affluent households suggests that more intangible benefits of living in a green building may also play a role.

AB  - Research background: The implementation of EU directives in national legislations imposes an obligation to monitor energy efficiency in every sector of the economy, including construction. In the era of energy conservation, which results from environmental requirements, as well as from constantly increasing energy prices, the energy consumption of premises and buildings becomes an important prerequisite for decision-making processes in the real estate market. There have also been changes in the provisions of the Act on Real Estate Management, which impose an obligation on the professional group of property appraisers to incorporate energy performance certificates for buildings and premises into the valuation process. Energy intensity in terms of the demand for heating of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units.Purpose: The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high-rise buildings) and the diverse distribution of units in the building, especially with regard to their exposure to the different point of the compass. The research covered the Słoneczne housing estate in Szczecin, in a situation where the property appraiser does not have access to the energy performance certificates of the estimated apartments as well as apartments taken for comparison. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between energy intensity and market value of residential units on the selected real estate market. The analysis will be based on data from the Price and Value Register of the County Office, a collection of statistics and public information as well as on the authors’ own databases and research.Research methodology: A multidimensional analysis will be used to distinguish homogeneous groups of residential units due to their property attributes. The study will also employ a valuation model including energy intensity and time variables.Results: The study showed that building type is one of the features determining energy consumption by a building. Depending on the period, the introduced attributes explained the evolution of the unit price at 78%, 75% and 24%. The parameters of the variables Size, Neighborhood and Time were found to be statistically significant. What is more, in all three periods, the value of the residential unit was significantly affected by the type of building which determined the energy performance of the building.Novelty: Energy intensity in terms of the heating demand of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units. The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high buildings) and the different location of units in a building, especially in relation to the directions of the world.

Moreover, the inventory of "green" office space in the United States has increased dramatically since the introduction of rating schemes that attest to the energy efficiency or sustainability of commercial buildings. In some metropolitan areas, the supply of certified office buildings has more than doubled in the last decade, and there are a few metropolitan areas where "green" office space now accounts for more than a quarter of the total office stock. In this paper, we analyze the diffusion of buildings certified for energy efficiency across US property markets. Using a panel of 48 metropolitan areas observed over the last fifteen years, we trace the diffusion of green building practices across the country. We then model the geographic patterns and dynamics of building certification, relating industry composition, changes in economic conditions, characteristics of the local commercial property market, and the presence of human capital, to the cross-sectional variation in energy-efficient building technologies and the diffusion of those technologies over time. Understanding the determinants and the rate at which energy-efficient building practices diffuse over space and time is important for designing policies to affect resource consumption in the built environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AU  - Pommeranz Carolin
AU  - Steininger, Bertram I
T2  - Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics
AB  - We analyze whether lower rents for energy-inefficient apartments reflect tenants’ willingness to pay due to a higher green awareness, purchasing power, or energy consumption costs. Based on a German rental apartment dataset from Q1 2007 to Q1 2019, we use interaction terms for socioeconomic characteristics in a hedonic regression model. We find that rents are lower for apartments with higher energy consumption, even in neighborhoods with lower levels of green awareness. This relationship is stronger in neighborhoods with higher purchasing power, such that communities with low levels of green awareness and high purchasing power show the steepest negative slope for increasing energy consumption (−8.6% from the highest to lowest rating). Thus, the rent-decreasing effect of purchasing power is higher than that of green awareness. Splitting the entire period into smaller windows, we find that the interaction effect of green awareness has emerged in the most recent years (2017–2019). This may be driven by changes in regulation, which have made it easier for tenants to assess the energy consumption before they rent, or by a general increase in green awareness over this period.

AB  - Building is the "last mile" sector in carbon neutrality transition, and commercial buildings have the largest decarbonization potential using current strategies and technologies. This study focused on China and the United States (US) to assess carbon-dioxide (CO2) abatement in commercial building operations at different emission scales and investigate the carbon abatement efficiency of the two countries from 2001 to 2018. The results show that: (i) Economic efficiency and energy intensity are key to reducing CO2 intensity in Chinese and American commercial buildings, respectively; (ii) Generally, CO2 abatement efficiency in China was 1.1–1.9 times that of the US, although CO2 abatement in China and the US in 2001–2018 was close [China: 1451.89 (±549.05) mega-tons of CO2, US: 1929.84 (±757.36) mega-tons of CO2]; (iii) Ridge regression tested the robustness of CO2 abatement results of the assessment model successfully. Furthermore, the study mapped paths for energy efficiency improvement in commercial buildings in China and the US to explore the strategy that best decarbonizes buildings. Overall, this study covers the research gap on a carbon abatement assessment tool for different economies or regions to compare the historical carbon abatement features on building operation.

TI  - The Introduction of Sustainable Strategies and Technology to the US Housing Building Industry: Design, Construction and Performance Analysis of Energy-Efficient Residential Buildings – A Case Study
AU  - Ruegemer, Joerg
T2  - International Journal of Technology, Knowledge and Society
AB  - Based on the recent emphasis on energy-efficient buildings in the United States, a high demand exists for architects, engineers, developers, builders, and clients to understand the context in which energy efficient design and construction influence the overall energy consumption and costs of a building. This paper describes a research project that focuses on a comprehensive analysis and documentation of an energy-efficient low-income / close to market rate housing development in Park City, Utah, USA. The project consists of 13 single-family residences that will mainly be constructed with Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs). The project will monitor and analyze building cost and construction efficacy of the energy efficient buildings and their components, and compare it to standard constructions in the Northern Utah Cold Climate Zone. The US Department of Energy DOE sponsors the research project as part of a strategy to transform the US housing market towards an energy-efficient, sustainable industry. Part of the strategy is to provide actors of that industry, which are mainly developers, contractors, and builders, with valuable knowledge on how to build energy-efficient houses. Despite comprehensive research in the field of energy-efficient buildings during the last two decades, most of the results have not reached the US architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) industries in the field of residential buildings yet. The paper will report on the project’s progress to analyze the specific building design, materials, components, and construction methods, to evaluate the strategies that will lead to a higher energy-efficiency compared to a traditional building. Obstacles and barriers that occur during the construction period will be comprehensively analyzed and compared to standard construction methods to better understand the resistance of the housing building industry towards new construction methods.

AB  - This paper considers the relationship between energy-efficient design and the leasing/sales markets for commercial real estate. An economic model is provided that considers lease rates and occupancy in simultaneous equilibrium. The behavior of both is predicted to be influenced by efficient design attributes. Selling price is determined by both rents and occupancy; therefore the impact of efficient design on commercial sales activity should be distributed through the leasing market. The model is tested empirically using a national sample of sales and leasing data for class A office buildings. The evidence indicates that "green" buildings achieve superior rents and sustain significantly higher occupancy. The improved performance in the rental market is reflected in a significant premium for the selling price of Energy Star-labeled and LEED-certified properties.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The present study investigates the knowledge transfer (KT) processes from Norwegian University of Science and Technology to College ESLG in Kosovo. An inter-organisational knowledge of transfer theoretical framework from the business sector was applied to guide the present study. The data was generated through semi-structured interviews with key university officers, professors, and students in continuous education programmes from College ESLG and documentary evidence analysis from two partner universities. Based on the thematic analysis of the data, the findings demonstrated that the curriculum mapping process, joint lectures between Norwegian and Kosovar professors, joint research, and joint study visits facilitated the KT. While the transfer of knowledge most evidently resulted in institutional capacity development for the Kosovar College unit, the dissemination of knowledge to other units within the college was more challenging due to communication problems between the Real Estate Department and other units within the college.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - National domestic energy-efficiency policies are unlikely to be implemented in a geographically uniform manner. This paper demonstrates the importance of socioeconomic, contextual, and local policy conditions in shaping the spatially heterogeneous response to a national policy. Through an assessment of the geographical and temporal variation in domestic energy-efficiency assessments provided under the United Kingdom's Green Deal, the factors underpinning the spatial diffusion of this policy are identified. Spatial regression models show that the presence of young families, university educated residents, detached homes, and large households positively affects the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments whereas property market activity, personal incomes, the presence of self-employed residents, and the efficiency levels of the existing housing stock has a dampening effect. National incentives for policy implementation that are distributed through selected local authorities also work to promote the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments. Overall, the analysis clearly shows the importance of local factors in determining how national policies are implemented on the ground. This has important implications for policymakers in designing and administering national policy frameworks, in trading-off targeted implementation with fairness and uniformity, and in evaluating the local effectiveness of national policies.

T2  - Journal of Real Estate Literature
AB  - A variety of green certifications is now available for residential housing in the United States. However, they have not been thoroughly investigated yet. The few existing studies have found positive valuation impacts for green-certified homes, mainly using the ENERGY STAR certification, relative to homes with no green certification. In this study, we utilize a sample comprised only of green-certified homes to test for differences in transaction outcomes across different types of green certifications. The results indicate that ENERGY STAR certified homes experience a significant price increase relative to other types of green certification, while EarthCraft certified homes do not. Given that the expected energy savings for EarthCraft certification and ENERGY STAR certification are almost identical, but EarthCraft requires additional green building standards to be met, these results are interpreted as evidence that home buyers are assigning value simply to the more recognizable program name rather than the potential cost savings (or other benefits) from program participation.

AU  - Hsu, David
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Many different governments have begun to require disclosure of building energy performance, in order to allow owners and prospective buyers to incorporate this information into their investment decisions. These policies, known as disclosure or information policies, require owners to benchmark their buildings and sometimes conduct engineering audits. However, given substantial variation in the cost to disclose different types of information, it is natural to ask: how much and what kind of information about building energy performance should be disclosed, and for what purposes? To answer this question, this paper assembles and cleans a comprehensive panel dataset of New York City multifamily buildings, and analyzes its predictive power using a Bayesian multilevel regression model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals that building-level variation is the most important factor in explaining building energy use, and that there are few, if any, relationships of building systems to observed energy use. This indicates that disclosure laws requiring benchmarking data may be relatively more useful than engineering audits in explaining the observed energy performance of existing buildings. These results should inform the further development of information disclosure laws. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The number of multi-family housing complexes (MFHCs) over 15 yr old in South Korea is expected to exceed 5 million by 2015. Accordingly, the demand for energy retrofit in the deteriorating MFHCs is rapidly increasing. This study aimed to develop a decision support model for establishing the optimal energy retrofit strategy for existing MFHCs. It can provide clear criteria for establishing the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) and allow efficient budget allocation for conducting the energy retrofit. The CERT for "S" MFHC, one of MFHCs located in Seoul, as a case study, was set at 23.0% (electricity) and 27.9% (gas energy). In the economic and environmental assessment, it was determined that scenario #12 was the optimal scenario (ranked second with regard to NPV40 (net present value at year 40) and third with regard to SIR40 (saving to investment ratio at year 40). The proposed model could be useful for owners, construction managers, or policymakers in charge of establishing energy retrofit strategy for existing MFHCs. It could allow contractors in a competitive bidding process to rationally establish the CERT and select the optimal energy retrofit strategy. It can be also applied to any other country or sector in a global environment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Energy saving measures, if incorporated into existing and new buildings, can help the UK to achieve its ambitious goal to reduce carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. Yet, the penetration of such technologies has been slow in the commercial real estate market. This paper examines the attitudes and preferences of office end users and their acceptance of carbon emission reducing technologies. It employs conjoint analysis to model the real estate decision-making of 150 respondents who claimed to have an input into their organisation's choice of premises. The findings demonstrate that functionality and accessibility remain top priorities in occupiers' choice of premises. Lower rents, improved corporate image and productivity are revealed as attributes that could compensate occupiers for energy-efficient attributes that restrict control over internal environment and operation of equipment. The paper discusses instruments to promote greater acceptance and penetration of carbon emission reducing design features in the office market. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Rural buildings in China now account for more than half of China's total building energy use. Forty percent of the floorspace in China is in rural villages and towns. Most of these buildings are very energy inefficient, and may struggle to provide for basic needs. They are cold in the winter, and often experience indoor air pollution from fuel use. The Chinese government plans to adopt a voluntary building energy code, or design standard, for rural homes. The goal is to build on China's success with codes in urban areas to improve efficiency and comfort in rural homes. The Chinese government recognizes rural buildings represent a major opportunity for improving national building energy efficiency. The challenges of rural China are also greater than those of urban areas in many ways because of the limited local capacity and low income levels. The Chinese government wants to expand on new programs to subsidize energy efficiency improvements in rural homes to build capacity for larger-scale improvement. This article summarizes the trends and status of rural building energy use in China. It then provides an overview of the new rural building design standard, and describes options and issues to move forward with implementation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Buildings are responsible for approximately 36% of carbon emissions in the European Union. Besides, gradual aging and a lack of adaptability and flexibility of buildings often lead to destructive interventions, resulting not only in higher costs but also in a large amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). Recently, an innovative system (Ref. VEEP project) has been developed to recycle CDW for the manufacturing of energy‐efficient prefabricated concrete elements (PCE) for new building construction. By applying life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA), this study aimed to determine whether the use of VEEP PCE leads to lower carbon emission and lower associated costs over the life cycle of an exemplary four‐story residential building in the Netherlands than a business‐as‐usual (BAU) PCE scenario. This paper provides a case study on the alignment and/or integration of LCA and LCC in an independent and a combined manner (via monetization). This study examines how the internalization of carbon emission and discount rate will affect the final life cycle costs over a 40‐year life span. The simulation results show that the key to economic viability and environmental soundness of VEEP PCE is to reduce production cost and to optimize the thermal performance of the novel isolation material Aerogel; internalization of external cost monetarizes the environmental advantage thus slightly expands the cost advantage of low carbon options, but leads to larger uncertainty about the LCC result.

Energy audits can provide information on how to reduce energy loss in a home, but the use of audits is rare. We use data from a national survey of 1700 homeowners to study the factors affecting a home owner's choice to have an audit. We create an index of energy inattention for our survey respondents. This index and two additional behavioral factors prove to be important determinants of the audit choice.

AB  - Retrofit actions applied to the existent building stock aim at increasing the energy performance, considering the optimal trade-off between energy savings and costs, according to the Directive 2010/31/EU. To select effective refurbishment measures and to quantify the energy saving potentials of the existent building stock, the analysis should be performed on "reference buildings". This article presents a methodology for the identification of reference buildings, according to the IEE-TABULA project (2009-12) aimed at creating a harmonised structure for "European Building Typologies". Among the possible applications of the building typology, this work focuses on the potentialities of energy savings and CO2 emission reductions for the European residential building stock. In particular, the Italian approach to model the energy balance of a subset of the national building stock is described; the results show the enormous potentialities of energy savings even with basic energy retrofit actions. Cost analyses were not in the scope of the project, but the results of this study are the basis for further investigations aimed at assessing the cost effectiveness of sets of measures. In this regard, the TABULA building-types are being applied by the Italian government for calculating cost-optimal levels of energy performance, complying with the Directive 2010/31/EU objectives.

T2  - Regional Science and Urban Economics
AB  - U.S. housing accounted for over 22% of the country's total primary energy consumption in 2009, which equated to more than $2000 per household and $229 billion in aggregate expenditure. It appears that these amounts could be reduced substantially, with benefits to both household budgets and the environment's well-being. This paper's goal is to evaluate the alternative mechanisms that could expedite energy efficiency retrofits for U.S. housing. We begin by evaluating the evidence that significant improvements in the energy efficiency of existing U.S. housing are feasible, both technologically and financially. We compare the relatively optimistic positions taken in McKinsey and Company (2009a,b), EPRI (2009), and Harcourt, Brown, and Carey (2011) versus the less optimistic appraisal in Allcott and Greenstone (2012). We conclude that significant energy savings do appear to be both technologically and financially feasible. The remainder of the paper considers the bottlenecks that hamper energy-saving investments for the residential sector. We focus on imperfect information and loan market failures as the two key factors. We evaluate the state of the art with respect to scoring and assessment tools for energy-saving investments and the On-Bill, PACE, and Solar programs to facilitate secured loans. The discussion concludes with a series of proposals to overcome the bottlenecks.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of economic conditions and local attitudes on investors' decisions to opt for a green building certificate. The results indicate that green building certification is not only responsive to economic conditions but also to the attitudes of the local population. Areas with well-educated people and a political preference for the Democratic Party significantly and positively influence the decision to certify buildings. Higher education levels and Democratic partisanship are associated with the environmental orientation of the population. Hence, in these locations, the population's environmental concerns may play a key role.

T2  - Environmental Impact Assessment Review
AB  - Carbon emissions are considered as major factor affecting sustainable urban development. Cities have been promoting low carbon city (LCC) strategies to reduce carbon emissions and various methods have been introduced to assess the performance of LCC strategies. However, most of the existing assessment methods focus on overall LCC performance at city level, but the effects of individual dimensions like industrial structure and energy efficiency are ignored. The research question in this study therefore is whether an alternative method can be established to measure both the overall and dimensional LCC performance. This paper introduces a method for assessing LCC performance by using Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which is called LCC-CMM. The proposed method of LCC-CMM can help identify LCC maturity grade through assessing the performance of individual LCC dimensions which contributes to overall performance. There are four procedures in applying LCC-CMM, including to identify the Key Process Areas (KPAs) in the context of LCC, denoted as LCC-KPAs, to define the indicators for measuring the performance of LCC-KPAs, to calculate the performance score for each LCC-KPA, and to define criteria for specifying different grades of LCC capability maturity. The proposed method is proven effective through a case demonstration. The method can help policy makers to identify weak areas in LCC practice and introduce tailor-made policy measures to improve the weak areas.

AU  - Ravetz, Joe
T2  - Energy policy
AB  - The UK building stock has seen major changes in the last 50 years, in its form, fabric and function. The context is the expansion of the building stock and built infrastructure, which takes place in most areas at 1-2% per year, with the implication that up to 75% of the dwellings of the year 2050 already exist now. This is a major challenge. The energy performance of much of this stock is generally low, while its economic, social and cultural values are often high. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief outline of the state of knowledge of the existing building stock, and of potential advances in that knowledge. We follow a knowledge mapping approach, set out on several axes. The first is an axis from buildings as physical forms, to buildings as containers of socio-economic activity. Another axis spans between existing buildings, renovations and adaptations, and new buildings. A third axis is that of scale, from building components to large-scale settlements. There are many possible combinations of these parameters. Here we focus on those that are most relevant to the SEMBE goals of sustainable energy management across the whole building stock.

AB  - In this paper, we identify key drivers and barriers for the adoption of building energy retrofits in Germany, which is promoted by public policy as an important measure to address the future challenges of climate change and energy security. We analyze data from a 2009 survey of more than 400 owner-occupiers of single-family detached, semidetached, and row houses in Germany, that was conducted as a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). In the survey, respondents were asked directly for reasons for and against retrofitting their homes, but also faced a choice experiment involving different energy retrofit measures. Overall, we find that house owners who are able to afford it financially, for whom it is profitable, and for whom there is a favorable opportunity are more likely to undertake energy retrofit activities. The latter point seems to be of particular importance in explaining the persistent low retrofit rate in Germany. Our results suggest that professional energy advice could stimulate the demand for building energy retrofits. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to estimunate the impact of energy saving investment in residential and public buildings in Croatia for the period 2015-2020. The aim is to assess the overall socio-economic impact of energy saving renovation measures defined in Croatian strategic documents in terms of the direct, indirect and induced growth of gross value added, employment and government revenues. An estimate of the avoided costs of air pollution is also included. The overall economic impact assessment is based on an input-output methodology. From the point of view of individual investors, the benefits in terms of reduced future expenses related to energy products are usually below energy efficient renovation investment costs, making an investment financially viable only if government support is provided. If the benefits for society as a whole are included, energy efficient renovation could be assessed as viable even in the short-run. Energy saving retrofits of residential and public buildings positively contribute to economic growth, employment and protection of the environment. Because of economic growth, the tax revenues induced by these investments could compensate for government expenditures, and the overall impact on the public deficit is expected to be neutral even in the short-run.

AB  - Building energy efficiency rating systems have been established worldwide to systematically manage the energy consumption of existing buildings. This study aimed to develop a new energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings from two perspectives: (i) establishment of reasonable and fair criteria for the building energy efficiency rating system; and (ii) establishment of comparative incentive and penalty programs to encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign. Based on the analysis of the conventional energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings, this study was conducted in five steps: (i) data collection and analysis; (ii) correlation analysis between the household size and the CO2 emission density (i.e., CO2 emission per unit area); (iii) cluster formation based on results of the correlation analysis using a decision tree; (iv) establishment of a new energy efficiency rating system for existing buildings; and (v) establishment of incentive and penalty programs using advanced case-based reasoning. The proposed system can allow a policymaker to establish a reasonable and fair energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings and can encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign.

TI  - What drives "green housing" construction? Evidence from Switzerland
AU  - Salvi, Marco
AU  - Syz, Juerg
T2  - Journal of financial economic policy
AB  - Switzerland boasts arguably the highest density of green properties in the world. In 2008, more than 15% of total new construction received the Swiss energy building label Minergie. The spatial distribution of these green buildings, however, is highly heterogeneous. In some regions, more than half of the new dwellings are built according to the Swiss green building standard. In others, this share is still negligible. The purpose of this paper is to identify the determinants of the distribution of green housing. For 2,571 Swiss municipalities, the author computes the green building share of new residential buildings. Data are collected for several variables measuring demographic, geographic, social, cultural, and political aspects that - according to the authors' hypothesis - may influence green building activity. Count regression is used to estimate the impact of these variables on the demand for green buildings. It is found that differences in income levels and cultural affiliation between Swiss municipalities account for the largest part of the variation in green building activity. The impact of homeowners' stance on environmentalism is highly significant but less important. Government subsidies do not seem to trigger additional green housing activity. The paper presents one of the first empirical analyses regarding the determinants of green building activity. Thanks to a comprehensive dataset, the authors are able to investigate the impact of potential drivers of "green housing" construction activity. The regional variation in governmental incentives is analysed and delivers valuable insight for policymakers interested in spurring the development of green buildings.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Turkey's energy demand has been growing by 4.5% per year over the last decade. As a reaction to this, the Turkish government has implemented the Strategic Energy Efficiency Plan (SEEP), which provides a guideline for energy efficiency policies in all sectors. The aim of this study is to analyse the potential of the SEEP on final energy demand in the Turkish residential sector until 2030. Three scenarios are developed based on a detailed bottom-up modelling approach using a vintage stock model to simulate the energy demand of heating systems and appliances. The results show a decreasing final energy demand in the reference scenario from about 944 PJ in 2008 to 843 PJ in 2030. This reflects a structural break, which is mainly caused by a high building demolition rate and low efficiency in the existing building stock. The SEEP achieves additional savings of around 111 PJ until 2030, while a scenario with even higher efficiency shows further savings of 91 PJ. Electricity demand increases in all scenarios -- mainly due to growing ownership rates of appliances. The SEEP will achieve around 10 TWh of electricity savings in 2030 compared to the reference scenario, mainly through more ambitious end-use standards.

AU  - Greenwood, Dan

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The knowledge and enforcement problems faced by governments in defining traditional 'command and control' regulation are well known. Significant legal scholarship offers alternative models of 'smart,' 'responsive' environmental regulation, emphasising the need for policy instrument mixes, including the vital role of voluntary, industry-led sustainability standards. Yet, as is being increasingly recognised, these contributions leave open the need for detailed, qualitative evaluation of instrument mixes as a complement to primarily quantitative cost-benefit analyses that predominate in regulatory impact assessments by governments. Addressing this need, this paper evaluates policy and standards for low and zero carbon homes in England during the Coalition government (2010-2015) when the ecological modernisation discourse of the previous New Labour government became subsumed by a deregulation agenda. Our study, incorporating 70 stakeholder interviews, suggests that, in supplier-driven markets such as housing in England, a 'smart' mix of mandatory and voluntary standards requires a strong, central role for government in setting national, mandatory standards and supporting their delivery. There is an important potential supplementary role for voluntary tools and local authority discretion, though our study highlights problems that can arise when such different instruments promote diverging roadmaps towards a policy goal.

AB  - Built environment is responsible for 60% of total energy consumption in European countries and 128 million BOE of primary energy in Belgium. The average energy consumption in the residential buildings of Belgium is 70% higher than the EU average and stands at 348 kW h/m2/year. Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) provides guidelines for energy performance analysis of buildings in Belgium. In this study, a holistic approach has been adopted to analyse the building stock of Liege, Belgium. This analysis is based on 'General Socio-economic survey 2001' and 'Housing quality survey 2006 in Walloon region' databases. It considers parameters such as buildings age, built-up area, type of heating system, type of fuel used, adjacency, insulation of roofs and walls and energy consumption etc. for an in depth analysis. This study concludes that about 69% of buildings which are constructed before 1945 needs serious renovation towards the improvement of roof and external wall insulation level. It then successfully identifies specific areas which need detailed study to evaluate the comfort status in the existing building stock, improvement of insulation level and its effect on heating energy consumption as well as the economic analysis on energy efficiency measurements.

T2  - Energy policy
AB  - This paper reviews the thermal performance of the existing UK housing stock, the main fabric efficiency incentive schemes and the barriers to obtaining deep energy and CO'2 savings throughout the stock. The UK faces a major challenge to improve the thermal performance of its existing housing stock. Millions of dwellings possess 'hard-to-treat' solid walls and have glazing which is not cost effective to improve. A range of fabric efficiency incentive schemes exist, but many do not target the full range of private and social housing. From now on, the Green Deal will be the UK's key energy efficiency policy. However, the scheme is forecasted to have low consumer appeal and low incentives for investors. Moreover, calculated Green Deal loan repayments will be reliant upon estimated energy savings, yet it is claimed that retrofit measures may only be half as effective as anticipated due to a lack of monitoring, poor quality installation and the increased use of heating following refurbishment. Looking to Germany, there has been success through the Passivhaus standard, but the UK currently lacks appropriate skills and cost effective components to replicate this approach. In addition, the embodied energy in retrofit products and materials threatens to counter operational savings. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - Building energy efficiency standards (BEES) are believed to be one of the most effective policies to reduce building energy consumption, especially in the case of the rapid urbanization content in China. However, there is little evidence backed up by measured data to validate the actual effectiveness of BEES in China. Using survey data collected from 1128 households in Chongqing China, this study applied the propensity scores matching method to estimate the effect of two BEES levels: the 50%-BEES (low level) and the 65%-BEES (high level). Results show that buildings built with 65%-BEES, on average, can reduce cooling and heating electricity use intensity (kWh/m2/a) by 41%, compared to buildings in the absence of the BEES. Meanwhile, the adoption of 50%-BEES can reduce cooling and heating electricity use intensity (kWh/m2/a) by 38%. However, energy savings are not significant if comparing buildings with 65%-BEES and 50%-BEES. The results indicate that there exists a performance gap between calculated design performance savings and actual operation energy savings. These empirical findings provide policymakers with valuable feedback on buildings' actual performance. The findings suggest that it is necessary to incorporate outcome-based compliance pathways into the current BEES system. Lastly, a data-driven building policy evaluation mechanism should be developed in China. Energy consumption databases should be developed to support policies such as building energy codes and standards' development and performance evaluation.

AB  - There is a modest amount of research on the valuation impact of green housing features, but research on renovations or remodeling, which include green features called "green retrofits," cannot be found. The analysis in this paper uses consistent controls and methods to investigate the valuation implication of green retrofits on residential transaction prices. We find that renovated properties in the sample of residential transaction prices are sold at price levels 5.8% higher on average than properties that are not renovated, all else equal. However, green retrofits sell for 9.9% higher on average than non-renovated properties, and green retrofits sell for about 12.7% higher on average than non-green renovated properties. It appears that investment in residential green building features is capitalized in housing prices. We find that green retrofitted properties spend fewer days on the market compared to other transactions.

AU  - Janda, Kathryn B
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Axon et al., (2012) argue that maximizing the potential for energy efficiency and demand reduction in tenanted commercial properties requires a "building communities" approach. This paper develops and extends Axon et al.'s proposed framework in two ways. First, by extending its applicability from tenanted to owner-occupied properties. Second, by situating it within the literature related to organizational culture, occupant behaviours, and technology adoption. The paper begins with a brief review of the existing research on people, energy and commercial buildings. This literature tends to address either organizational choices, or occupant behavior, but it rarely crosses the analytical boundaries between these two groups. The paper then explores these different levels of analysis within a 3Cs -- "concern, capacity, and conditions" -- framework, which was developed to describe and distinguish organizational responses to an energy crisis. The combination of the "building communities" and 3Cs frames reveals gaps and grey areas between organizational culture, occupant behaviour, and technology adoption where further conservation opportunities may lie. These understudied areas suggest that there may be "social potential" for change that is between and beyond the frames used by previous research in the field. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - In Brazil the housing deficit is around 5.5 million houses. To address this need, the government created a programme called "My house, My life". The main subsidies of the programme are for families earning up to three times the minimum wage. In order to formulate strategies for more energy efficiency buildings, it is necessary to understand the thermal and energy performance of what is being built. This article defines representative projects for typologies being built in the Brazilian social housing sector through the analysis of 108 projects considering two groups of income levels and investigates the thermal and energy performance of the representative projects in relation to the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labelling of Residential Buildings in Brazil for two bioclimatic zones. Five representative building models were defined. Considering the most common features found on the sample, the study suggests the importance of addresing energy efficiency measures on the sector since current building techniques for social housing shows a tendency towards a low performance in relation to the thermal and energy performance criteria of the Energy Labelling especially for lower income projects. This provides a basis for future policy and allows for more in depth studies within the sector. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300859]

AB  - According to the recast of the Energy Performance Building Directive, Member States must give an exact definition for nearly zero-energy buildings to be introduced from 2018/2020. The requirement system stipulating the sustainable development of the building sector is usually based on the analysis of a few reference buildings, combining energy efficiency measures and HVAC systems. The risk of this method is that depending on the assumptions either the requirements do not provide sufficient incentives for energy saving measures and renewables or the requirements cannot be fulfilled with rational solutions in many cases. Our method is based on the artificial generation of a large building sample, where the buildings are defined by geometric and other parameters. Due to the large number of combinations, the effect of many variables appear in the results, with the deviations reflecting the sensitivity of the energy balance. The requirements are set based on some fundamental considerations and the statistical analysis of the sample. The method is demonstrated on the example of setting the requirements for residential buildings in Hungary. The proposed requirements are validated against the common European targets. The suggested method is suitable for developing building energy regulation threshold values, certification schemes or benchmarking values.

TI  - Setting the standard? A framework for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of building energy standards
AU  - Papineau, Maya
T2  - Energy Economics
AB  - The adoption rate and stringency of building energy standards in the U.S. have been increasing since the mid-1990s as a result of the Energy Policy Act mandate of 1992 (EPAct). Current evidence on the energy savings that accrue from commercial building energy standards is based on engineering simulations, which do not account for realized behaviour once a standard is actually adopted. This paper uses quasi-experimental variation in commercial building energy standard adoptions to estimate their effect on realized electricity consumption and cost-effectiveness. In states induced by EPAct to adopt an energy standard where all new nonresidential construction was erected under a commercial standard, electricity consumption per service worker is lower by about 12%, and total commercial electricity consumption is lower by 10%. Including early adopters and never-adopters to the analysis leads to a downward bias in the treatment effect. The realized electricity savings in the EPAct states represent three quarters of predicted simulated savings, and electricity saved in 2010 came at a cost of approximately 7.7 cents per kWh.

AB  - While the concept of reflective roofing is not new to China, most Chinese cool roof research has taken place within the past decade. Some national and local Chinese building energy efficiency standards credit or recommend, but do not require, cool roofs or walls. EnergyPlus simulations of standard-compliant Chinese office and residential building prototypes in seven Chinese cities (Harbin, Changchun, Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou) showed that substituting an aged white roof (albedo 0.6) for an aged gray roof (albedo 0.2) yields positive annual load, energy, energy cost, CO2, NOx, and SO2 savings in all hot-summer cities (Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou). Measurements in an office building in Chongqing in August 2012 found that a white coating lowered roof surface temperature by about 20 °C, and reduced daily air conditioning energy use by about 9%. Measurements in a naturally ventilated factory in Guangdong Province in August 2011 showed that a white coating decreased roof surface temperature by about 17 °C, lowered room air temperature by 1-3 °C, and reduced daily roof heat flux by 66%. Simulation and experimental results suggest that cool roofs should be credited or prescribed in building energy efficiency standards for both hot summer/warm winter and hot summer/cold winter climates in China.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - This paper presents a two-fold evaluation method determining whether to renovate an existing building or to demolish it and thereafter erect a new building. The method determines a combination of energy saving measures that have been optimised in regards to the future cost for energy. Subsequently, the method evaluates the cost of undertaking the retrofit measures as compared to the cost of demolishing the existing building and thereafter erecting a new one. Several economically beneficial combinations of energy saving measures can be determined. All of them are a trade-off between investing in retrofit measures and buying renewable energy. The overall cost of the renovation considers the market value of the property, the investment in the renovation, the operational and maintenance costs. A multi-family building is used as an example to clearly illustrate the application of the method from macroeconomic and private financial perspectives. The example shows that the investment cost and future market value of the building are the dominant factors in deciding whether to renovate an existing building or to demolish it and thereafter erect a new building. Additionally, it is concluded in the example that multi-family buildings erected in the period 1850-1930 should be renovated.

AB  - In the U.S., where buildings account for 40% of energy use, commercial buildings use more energy per unit area than ever before. However, exemplary buildings demonstrate the feasibility of much better energy performance at no additional first cost. This research examines one possible explanation for this inconsistency. The aim is to investigate whether the anchoring bias, which refers to our tendency to gravitate towards a pre-defined standard regardless of its relevance, influences energy performance goals in building design. The scope examines professionals who help set energy performance goals for U.S. buildings. Prior to being asked to set an energy performance goal, these professionals were randomly directed to one of three series of questions. One series set an anchor of 90% energy reduction beyond standard practice, one set a 30% anchor, and one set no anchor. Respondents exposed to the 90% anchor, and respondents exposed to no anchor at all, set higher energy performance goals than respondents exposed to the 30% anchor. These results suggest that building rating systems that only reward incremental energy improvements may inadvertently create anchors, thereby discouraging more advanced energy performance goals and inhibiting energy performance that is technically and economically feasible.

AB  - According to statistics and field investigation, the energy consumption situation and reality of commercial building are described in this paper. As the first step of large-scale public building energy efficiency supervision system encouraged by central government of China, the energy consumption of several typical commercial buildings and public buildings were analyzed in detail. The main contents of the investigation are basic information of building, operational record of energy consumption equipment, energy consumption of indoor equipments, energy-efficiency assessment of energy consumption systems and equipments, investigation of behavior energy saving, etc. On this basis, further analysis and diagnosis, including indoor thermal and humid environment, operation state of air-conditioning water system, operation state of air-conditioning duct system and operation management of air-conditioning system, were implemented. The results show that commercial buildings have the most energy consumption of buildings in this city, which can reach to about 240 W/m^2 per year. Further analysis tells that air conditioning systems play the major role of building energy consumption, and building energy saving has great potential in this city.

AB  - From the perspectives of the energy and the environment, building stock should be considered a useful resource in the struggle against greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy resources. The aim of this work is to provide an example of the application of a methodology to evaluate the energy needs of the building stock of a city and to determine the possible strategies for energy planning. This paper aims to obtain an estimate, on an urban scale, of the energy needs and CO2 emissions of the public residential buildings of Bari. This estimate is achieved by evaluating the critical issues of the built heritage, the most common architectural typologies and the heating systems in the territory of the city of Bari in southern Italy, as well as the possible strategies for upgrading energy efficiency, through the combined use of energy software and geo-referenced systems. Furthermore, several possible interventions are assumed to improve the energy performance of buildings in not only environmental terms but also economic terms through the instrument of cost-benefit analysis. The ultimate goal is to compare the different intervention strategies to determine which demonstrate greater cost effectiveness and feasibility for future energy planning.

AB  - Commercial building owners and managers often face the challenge of selecting the appropriate combination of voluntary and mandated programs for commercial building energy efficiency. Using a mixed-method, both quantitative and qualitative approach, this study finds that barriers to energy efficiency can be interpreted as strategic drivers for the emergence of five forms of voluntary and mandated program forms. We argue that the links between energy efficiency programs in commercial buildings should be conceptualized in a comprehensive manner by evaluating the strategic drivers that have ultimately led to the emergence of the principal forms of voluntary programs: economic incentives; certifications; alliances and partnerships; and internal company programs. We develop a conceptual framework that helps building owners and managers: identify the primary drivers for energy efficiency efforts; assess the efficacy and limitations of available program forms; apply each program form strategically in conjunction with a number of other program forms; and, ultimately, predict the emergence of new program forms. In addition to United States Department of Energy survey data, this study draws upon data collected through semi-structured interviews with experts at major U.S.-based corporations, federally funded laboratories, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations.

AU  - Aberg, M

T2  - Energy policy
AB  - The development towards more energy efficient buildings, as well as the expansion of district heating (DH) networks, is generally considered to reduce environmental impact. But the combined effect of these two progressions is more controversial. A reduced heat demand (HD) due to higher energy efficiency in buildings might hamper co-production of electricity and DH. In Sweden, co-produced electricity is normally considered to displace electricity from less efficient European condensing power plants. In this study, a potential HD reduction due to energy efficiency measures in the existing building stock in the Swedish city Linkoping is calculated. The impact of HD reduction on heat and electricity production in the Linkoping DH system is investigated by using the energy system optimisation model MODEST. Energy efficiency measures in buildings reduce seasonal HD variations. Model results show that HD reductions primarily decrease heat-only production. The electricity-to-heat output ratio for the system is increased for HD reductions up to 30%. Local and global CO"2 emissions are reduced. If co-produced electricity replaces electricity from coal-fired condensing power plants, a 20% HD reduction is optimal for decreasing global CO"2 emissions in the analysed DH system.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The built environment can be used to influence travel demand, but very few studies consider the relative energy savings of such policies in context of a complex urban system. This analysis quantifies the day-to-day and embodied energy consumption of four different neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, to examine how built environment variations influence various sources of urban energy consumption. A microsimulation combines models for petroleum use (from driving) and residential and commercial power and natural gas use with rigorously measured building stock and infrastructure materials quantities (to arrive at embodied energy). Results indicate that the more suburban neighborhoods, with mostly detached single-family homes, consume up to 320% more embodied energy, 150% more operational energy, and about 160% more total life-cycle energy (per capita) than a densely developed neighborhood with mostly low-rise-apartments and duplexes. Across all neighborhoods, operational energy use comprised 83 to 92% of total energy use, and transportation sources (including personal vehicles and transit, plus street, parking structure, and sidewalk infrastructure) made up 44 to 47% of the life-cycle energy demands tallied. Energy elasticity calculations across the neighborhoods suggest that increased population density and reduced residential unit size offer greatest life-cycle energy savings per capita, by reducing both operational demands from driving and home energy use, and from less embodied energy from construction. These results provide measurable metrics for comparing different neighborhood styles and develop a framework to anticipate energy-savings from changes in the built environment versus household energy efficiency.

AB  - China's building sector consumes one quarter of total energy consumption in the country and plays an important role in long-term ability of the country to achieve sustainable development. This paper discusses a comprehensive approach to achieving low carbon sustainability in large commercial buildings in China incorporating both energy and carbon-reduction strategies. The approach concentrates primarily on three complementary aspects: (a) the introduction of an effective energy management system; (b) the incorporation of relevant advanced energy saving technologies and measures and (c) the promotion of awareness among occupants to make changes in their behaviour towards a more environmental-friendly behaviour. However, reference is also made to the role that renewable energy and offsetting may have in the effective management and environmental performance of buildings. Nine examples of large commercial buildings in Beijing and Shanghai were studied and the average electricity consumption of around 153 kWh/m^sub 2^ per annum is about 5 times higher than average electricity use in residential buildings. At the same time the associated green house gas (GHG) emissions are around 158 kg/m^sub 2^ per annum. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In the context of rapid urbanization and new construction in rural China, residential building energy consumption has the potential to increase with the expected increase in demand. A process-based hybrid life-cycle assessment model is used to quantify the life-cycle energy use for both urban and rural residential buildings in China and determine the energy use characteristics of each life cycle phase. An input-output model for the pre-use phases is based on 2007 Chinese economic benchmark data. A process-based life-cycle assessment model for estimating the operation and demolition phases uses historical energy-intensity data. Results show that operation energy in both urban and rural residential buildings is dominant and varies from 75% to 86% of life cycle energy respectively. Gaps in living standards as well as differences in building structure and materials result in a life-cycle energy intensity of urban residential buildings that is 20% higher than that of rural residential buildings. The life-cycle energy of urban residential buildings is most sensitive to the reduction of operational energy intensity excluding heating energy which depends on both the occupants' energy-saving behavior as well as the performance of the building itself.

AB  - Demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics influence variation in household energy consumption. By combining household-level utility, public, and proprietary data, we examine predictors of household energy consumption in a Texas urban area. Using quantile regression, this analysis assesses the relationship between energy consumption and predictors at the middle and both ends of the distribution (10th and 90th percentiles). Results indicate potential opportunities to lower consumption among the highest energy-consuming households including those with pools, with non-central cooling, with people working from home, those built on pier/post foundation, and those that are renter-occupied. These findings suggest significant opportunities to reduce consumption and demand as in the study area, almost 10% of housing units are renter-occupied, 18% percent are without central cooling, and 7% have pools. Capturing a significant portion of these homes for retrofit conservation efforts through marketing has potential to produce substantial results. Producing a better understanding of determinants of household energy consumption using the methods presented has potential to assist development and implementation of strategies to reduce consumption and increase efficiency.

This paper provides some guidelines to improve the building energy code to better select glazing types that minimize total energy use of residential buildings in Korea. In particular, detailed energy simulation analyses coupled with economical and environmental assessments are carried out to assess the thermal, economical, and environmental impacts of glazing thermal characteristics as well as window sizes associated with housing units in various representative climates within South Korea. The results of the analyses have clearly indicated that selecting glazing with low solar heat gain coefficient is highly beneficial especially for large windows and for mild climates. In particular, it is found that using any double-pane low-e glazing would provide better performance for windows in residential buildings than the clear double-pane glazing, currently required by the Korean building energy code.

An integrated thermal modeling, life cycle costing approach is applied to an extensive sample of dominant house designs for Australian conditions. The relative significance of predicted thermal performance and the applied discount rate on the Present Value of energy savings from alternative investment scenarios is investigated. Costs and benefits are also evaluated at the economy-wide scale, including carbon pricing considerations, and for a test-case household faced with alternative investment options at the point of construction. The influence of the applied discount rate on produced cost-benefit calculations is investigated, as is the interaction between critical cost-benefit input parameters. Findings support that the discounting framework is the primary driver of difference in estimates about costs and benefits of higher standards of efficiency in the residential sector. Results demonstrate that agreement on a low discount rate based on sustainability principals would prioritise those projects with significant environmental benefits. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The significance of bioclimatic architecture has become widely accepted since the 1970s and the implementation of its principles in practice is a key factor in order to achieve energy efficiency in the building sector. The way, however, from scientific acceptance to commercial utilization is not a straightforward one. This paper deals with the notion of bioclimatic architecture in buildings and investigates the aspects of this concept in Hellas. A sample of university researchers, building contractors and members of public organisations was interviewed using a standardised set of guidelines. The barriers to promoting bioclimatic design, role of the local government in the adoption process, level of environmental culture as well as perspectives of this concept in Hellas were the key areas of discussion in each of the interviews. The results from the data analysis reveal insufficient economic incentives, a lack in technical information as well as a lack in specific environmental policies that would foster the propagation of bioclimatic architecture.

AB  - Soaring building heating energy consumption (BHEC), along with rising income, is threatening carbon abatement efforts. However, the influencing mechanism of income on BHEC remains unclear. This study establishes a theoretical model of the impact of income on BHEC from three perspectives: building physical characteristics, building use characteristics and energy-consuming equipment characteristics. Then, we adopt a stepwise hierarchical regression method to examine the direct and intermediary effects between income and BHEC using microdata from 662 households in Chongqing, China. The results show that household income, residential building floor space, the amount of heating equipment, building energy efficiency standards, and the heating method significantly impact BHEC. Moreover, the direct effect of income on BHEC is up to 84%. The amount of heating equipment and residential building floor space are both strong intermediaries between income and BHEC, contributing 18.8% and 15.8%, respectively. The heating method is a weak intermediary, only contributing approximately 1% of the impact. Overall, this study can promote the development of the related theory of BHEC and provide a reference for the government to implement more effective energy-efficient policies on the local scale and even on the national and global scales.

AB  - Several aspects of energy conservation in nonmetropolitan rental housing are examined, with a focus on landlords.  Data collected through a survey of rental housing owners in 4 nonmetropolitan counties of New York State are analyzed.  Landlord behavior and perceptions differ according to their scale of operation and, to some extent, their profit motivations.  Accordingly, landlords are likely to respond to programmatic initiatives if such initiatives are targeted to landlords on the basis of these differences.  Significant differences in policy preferences, the use of investment criteria, and the application of energy conservation measures in their rental properties were observed between small- and large-scale landlords.  While Suchy and VonZuckerstein (1982) recommended that rental housing energy conservation programs could effectively be designed by tailoring landlord incentives based on their profit motivations, results from this study indicate that such a classification strategy may not be as useful as would be one based on the scale of an owner's rental property operations.

TI  - Occupant behaviour in energy efficient dwellings: evidence of a rebound effect
AU  - Guerra Santin, O
T2  - Journal of Housing and the Built Environment
AB  - The energy required for space heating has been significantly reduced in recent decades by making use of insulation and more efficient heating and ventilation systems. Even so, wide variations in energy consumption are still observed between similar dwellings and between actual and predicted levels. It is thought that these variations stem from differences in occupant behaviour, the structural quality of the building, and a rebound effect. This paper statistically examines differences in occupant behaviour in relation to the building characteristics of the housing stock in the Netherlands and explores the possible existence of a rebound effect on the consumption of energy for space heating. Rebound effect can be defined as the increase on energy consumption in services for which improvements in energy efficiency reduce the costs. We found that although energy consumption is lower in energy efficient dwellings, analysis of the behaviour variables indicates their occupants tend to prefer higher indoor temperatures and to ventilate less. This finding might be related to a rebound effect on occupant behaviour. However, the improvement of thermal properties and systems efficiency still lead to a reduction on energy consumption for heating.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The growing energy consumption in the residential sector represents about 30% of global demand. This calls for Demand Side Management solutions propelling change in behaviors of end consumers, with the aim to reduce overall consumption as well as shift it to periods in which demand is lower and where the cost of generating energy is lower. Demand Side Management solutions require detailed knowledge about the patterns of energy consumption. The profile of electricity demand in the residential sector is highly correlated with the time of active occupancy of the dwellings; therefore in this study the occupancy patterns in Spanish properties was determined using the 2009-2010 Time Use Survey (TUS), conducted by the National Statistical Institute of Spain. The survey identifies three peaks in active occupancy, which coincide with morning, noon and evening. This information has been used to input into a stochastic model which generates active occupancy profiles of dwellings, with the aim to simulate domestic electricity consumption. TUS data were also used to identify which appliance-related activities could be considered for Demand Side Management solutions during the three peaks of occupancy. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This paper investigates whether obtaining sustainable building certification entails a rental premium for commercial office buildings and tracks its development over time. To this aim, both a difference-in-differences and a fixed-effects model approach are applied to a large panel dataset of office buildings in the United States in the 2000-2010 period. The results indicate a significant rental premium for both ENERGY STAR and LEED certified buildings. Controlling for confounding factors, this premium is shown to have increased steadily from 2006 to 2008, followed by a moderate decline in the subsequent periods. The results also show a significant positive relationship between ENERGY STAR labeling and building occupancy rates. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Identifying free-ridership is significant to several issues relevant to program evaluation, including the calculation of net program benefits and assessments of political acceptability. Despite the potential of free-ridership to seriously undermine the economic efficiency of a program intervention, for instance to foster energy efficiency, the issue remains largely absent from contemporary environmental and energy policy discussions in Europe. One reason for this neglect is the inherent difficulty of assessing which households would have undertaken the energy conservation activity even without the program. This paper proposes a procedure to calculate the free-rider share using revealed preference data on home renovations from Germany's residential sector. We employ a discrete-choice model to analyze the effect of grants on renovation choices, the output from which is used to assess the extent of free-ridership under a subsidy program very akin to an implemented grants program in Germany. Our empirical results suggest only very moderate energy savings induced by the program, making free-riding a problem of outstanding importance. [PUB ABSTRACT]

AB  - Organizational interventions (OIs) and employees' psychological factors have a substantial effect on employees' energy-saving behaviors. However, existing studies have not considered the psychological mechanisms underlying the linkage between interventions and behaviors. To fill this gap, we explored the effect of OIs on employees' psychological factors and that of employees' psychological factors on their intentions to save energy. In doing so, we incorporated OIs in the theory of planned behavior model, and included employees' energy-saving knowledge and educational level as moderators. We found that (1) OIs improved employees' energy-saving attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, and they strengthened employees' intention to engage in energy-saving behaviors; (2) conveying expectations regarding energy-saving behaviors to employees worked better than emphasizing the importance of such behaviors; (3) increasing employees' knowledge of energy consumption may have strengthened the positive effect of OIs on employees' attitudes and perceived behavioral control in this context; and (4) the positive effect of OIs on the perceived behavioral control of employees with high and low educational level was greater than that on those with moderate educational level. These findings can help decision makers in companies to understand employees' energy-saving behaviors better and to formulate more effective energy-efficient policies.

AU  - Horne, Ralph

T2  - Journal of Housing and the Built Environment
AB  - Over the past 15 years, house building standards across the western world have begun to address ecologically sustainable development (ESD) principles. Amongst the range of environmental sustainability issues arising from housing construction and occupation, the energy demand for heating and/or cooling to maintain thermal comfort has the longest history and is most widespread in policy and regulation. Since energy in our homes is mainly fossil-derived, a key issue is global climate change impacts. Since greenhouse gas emissions can be emitted in various locations across the globe with similar results, it follows that a given greenhouse gas emission arising from residential space heating and cooling has approximately equal impact, irrespective of the location of the building. These emissions are therefore an appropriate candidate for benchmarking internationally, yet there have been few attempts to undertake this activity. This paper reports on a study undertaken in Australia which compares the thermal energy performance of housing in the United States, Canada, UK and Australia. The comparison is based on energy ratings of over 50 house designs from the comparison countries. Each design was assessed as being current and verified as complying with rather than significantly exceeding local regulatory requirements. Issues in design of both the buildings and the modelling tool used are highlighted, and the results are presented. Conclusions are drawn on the reasons for wide variations in thermal energy performance, the implications for benchmarking, and the case for globally consistent housing environmental performance policies and regulation.

TI  - Risk aversion and willingness to pay for energy efficient systems in rental apartments
AU  - Farsi, Mehdi
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - This paper uses a random utility model to estimate consumers' valuation of energy efficient insulation and ventilation systems in rental apartments. Given consumers' limited experience in residential buildings and the perceived uncertainty about their comfort benefits and resulting energy savings, these relatively new technologies might be undervalued by risk-averse consumers. Using the concept of certainty-equivalence, this paper proposes a model to assess the consumers' risk-aversion for adopting energy-efficient systems. These systems are treated as risky assets while conventional commodities are assumed to be risk-free. The curvature of the utility function is interpreted as a measure of aversion to perceived risks as opposed to explicit risks measured by observed variances. The proposed formulation is applicable in stated preference data with qualitative variables. The model is applied to data from a choice experiment conducted among 264 apartment tenants in Switzerland. The estimated curvatures reject the risk-neutrality hypothesis. The range of the estimated risk premiums suggests that risk considerations remain a central issue in dealing with energy efficiency in residential buildings. The analysis also indicates that assuming same risk attitudes toward new and conventional systems could bias the estimates of the willingness to pay, especially when the system is comprised of several components.

T2  - Housing Policy Debate
AB  - Energy use in residential buildings accounted for 21% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2013. Efforts to reduce energy use in the residential sector have been overly focused on improving energy efficiency of buildings. This article incorporates housing policy debate into energy policy, hoping to provide new opportunities for planners to participate in residential energy policy. Using data from the latest Residential Energy Consumption Survey, structural equation modeling has been applied to isolate the direct and indirect effects of household and housing characteristics on residential energy use. Results show that more than 80% of a household's indirect effect on energy consumption happens through the building characteristics, which is characterized as the housing choice effect on energy consumption. Planners can participate in residential energy management efforts by influencing housing needs and priorities of communities towards more sustainable compact housing units.

TI  - Estimating broad-brush rebound effects for household energy consumption in the EU 28 countries and Norway: some policy implications of Odyssee data
AU  - Galvin, Ray
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Currently there is a strong policy commitment in European Union (EU) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries to increase the energy efficiency of residential buildings, and it is widely assumed that this will naturally and automatically reduce domestic energy consumption. However, other factors such as fuel prices, wages, attitudes and lifestyles also influence energy consumption. This paper calculates broad-brush rebound effects based on changes in energy efficiency and energy consumption in each of the 28 EU countries plus Norway, for the years 2000-2011. In doing so, it tests how well the assumption of energy efficiency leading to energy reduction stands up to scrutiny in these lands. It uses the EU's Odyssee database for efficiency and consumption figures and a commonly employed econometric definition of the rebound effect as an energy-efficiency elasticity. Most older EU lands show rebound effects in the expected range of 0-50%. However, the range for newer EU countries is 100-550%, suggesting that energy efficiency increases are not a good predictor of energy consumption. A more in-depth look at one country, Germany, suggests these results underestimate the rebound effect significantly. This also identifies research needs for specific energy consumption determinants in each country, to find more precisely what is driving consumption levels.

We then analyze a large cross-section of office buildings, demonstrating that economic returns to energy-efficient buildings are substantial. Finally, we relate the economic premiums for green buildings to their relative efficiency in energy use -- the attributes rated for thermal efficiency, as well as sustainability, contribute to premiums in rents and asset values. Among green buildings, increased energy efficiency is fully capitalized into rents and asset values. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The worldwide issue of high housing prices has significantly affected the general population’s inhabitation right and their willingness to purchase homes. The governments of all countries have been actively promoting public housing policies to help satisfy daily living requirements for all social classes. However, many differences exist in the design requirements for public housing and typical housing design, and the lack of discussion on these differences has caused design outcomes to often fail in meeting users’ requirements. This study first adopts the Kano two-dimensional quality analysis method in an attempt to define the real needs of public housing users; subsequently, based on the quality function deployment method, it transforms the design requirements into a design strategy. The research findings indicate that future public housing must focus on multi-generational living arrangements, energy-efficient and barrier-free designs, flexible spaces, crime prevention, self-sufficient farming, and other such areas to satisfy the needs of different users. This study practically bases its case designs on a design strategy and obtained feedback from users to understand the expectations and cognitive differences between designers and residents.

Although, economically, there are many technological opportunities available, the Dutch built environment has difficulty to harvest this potential. This paper applies a sectoral innovation system approach to investigate this apparent paradox. This approach allows to identify and assess systemic barriers that prevent improvement in overall energy efficiency of the Dutch housing sector. Twenty-one experts were interviewed, and a qualitative data analysis was applied to identify barriers, and relate them to key dimensions in the sectoral innovation system framework. From this analysis, we identified poor regulatory design, lack of market demand, and some institutional characteristics of the construction sector as the key systemic barriers that hamper the diffusion of green energy innovations in the Dutch housing sector.

AB  - The IEA has estimated that over the next four decades US$31 trillion will be required to promote energy efficiency in buildings. However, the opportunities to make such investments are often constrained, particularly in contexts of austerity. We consider the potential of revolving funds as an innovative financing mechanism that could reduce investment requirements and enhance investment impacts by recovering and reinvesting some of the savings generated by early investments. Such funds have been created in various contexts, but there has never been a formal academic evaluation of their potential to contribute to low carbon transitions. To address this, we propose a generic revolving fund model and apply it using data on the costs and benefits of domestic sector retrofit in the UK. We find that a revolving fund could reduce the costs of domestic sector retrofit in the UK by 26%, or L9 billion, whilst also making such a scheme cost-neutral, albeit with significant up-front investments that would only pay for themselves over an extended period of time. We conclude that revolving funds could enable countries with limited resources to invest more heavily and more effectively in low carbon development, even in contexts of austerity.

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The building sector is responsible for a major share of energy consumption, with the most energy being consumed during the operation stage of buildings. Energy-efficiency retrofit (EER) policies have been promoted by numerous countries. However, the effectiveness of these incentive policies has been insufficient, a main reason being the agency problem between the government and building owners. In addition, most policies ignored the diversity of buildings and building owners, resulting in a lack of reaction from owners. To address this problem, this study proposed an agent-based model for policy making on EER. The model defined the government and owners as agents and their decision-making behaviors were modeled with principal-agent theory. A platform based on the proposed model was then developed and the incentive policy was optimized under different circumstances. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, three policy scenarios were compared on the platform, which are the policy by the proposed model, the incentive policy in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. The results showed that the incentive policy based on the proposed model has the best performance on energy savings, returns on investment, and leverage effects. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the government should pay more attention to energy price.

AB  - For several decades, manufactured housing has been a crucial source of affordable housing, particularly for rural areas. However, electricity consumption per unit area and per capita are substantially higher for manufactured housing units relative to site built, single-family detached units. This article uses data from the federal Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) to examine patterns of electricity consumption in manufactured housing units over time and to draw comparisons with single-family detached housing units. Regression analysis is used to model annual electricity consumption for manufactured housing units in 1990 and 2005. Temporal trends in key predictors are discussed and contrasted with those for single-family detached units. Findings suggest that the most important predictors of electricity consumption are comparable across the housing types considered and that while manufactured housing units may be gaining in energy efficiency over time, consumption per unit area and per capita are increasing faster than in single-family detached units.

TI  - Pricing principles and incentives for energy efficiency investments in multi-family rental housing: The case of Sweden
AU  - Lind, Hans
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Improving the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock is a high priority in Sweden. The focus of this viewpoint is on how incentives for improving energy efficiency are affected by pricing principles in two specific areas: housing rents and district heating fees. Many countries have regulations that affect how housing rent is determined. It has been shown that cost-based rents reduce incentives for energy efficiency. The same may occur if rent is related to qualities of the apartment, if these qualities do not include the indoor climate. There have been concerns that district heating companies might respond to lower sales by increasing prices, thus reducing any incentive to reduce energy consumption. It is argued that this will not happen if fixed and variable fees correctly reflect the cost structure. Empirical studies show that it is common to have a variable fee that is higher than the marginal cost, partly because of monopoly elements in the market. This type of pricing will actually strengthen the incentives for energy efficiency investments compared to theoretically correct pricing principles. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The split incentive problem concerns the lack of appropriate incentives to implement energy efficiency measures. In particular, low income tenants face a phenomenon of energy poverty in which they allocate significantly more of their household income to energy expenditures than other renters. This problem is substantial, affecting 1.89% of all United States' energy use. If effectively addressed, it would create a range of savings between 4 and 11 billion dollars per year for many of the nation's poorest residents. We argue that a carefully designed program of incentives for participants (including landlords) in conjunction with a unique type of utility-managed on-bill financing mechanism has significant potential to solve many of the complications. We focus on three kinds of split incentives, five concerns inherent to addressing split incentive problems (scale, endurance, incentives, savings, political disfavor), and provide a detailed policy proposal designed to surpass those problems, with a particular focus on low-income tenants in a U.S. context.

TI  - Energy savings from housing: Ineffective renovation subsidies vs efficient demolition and reconstruction incentives
AU  - Dubois, Maarten
AU  - Allacker, Karen
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Energy savings in the housing sector are key to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to incentivize energy savings are however disparate between countries. Taking into account environmental aspects and consumer surplus, the paper uses a stylized economic model to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of three economic instruments: subsidies for renovation, subsidies for demolition and reconstruction projects and subsidies for building new houses on virgin land. The assessment also relates to differentiated value added taxes and other financial incentives such as green loans. In a counter-intuitive way, the model highlights that subsidies for renovations with minor energy gains worsen the overall energy consumption of housing due to the inducement of lock-ins with energy inefficient houses. Structural changes are needed in the use of policy instruments. First, commonly applied support schemes for renovations with minor energy savings should be abolished. Second, scarce public resources should incentivize deep renovation and demolition and reconstruction. Finally, taxes should apply on the use of virgin land to persuade households with a high willingness to pay for a new house, to invest in demolition and reconstruction.

TI  - Operating Expenses and the Rent Premium of Energy Star and LEED Certified Buildings in the Central and Eastern U.S.
AU  - Reichardt, Alexander
T2  - Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between operating expenses and rents of Energy Star and LEED certified buildings in the Central and Eastern United States. Several studies have shown that sustainable buildings command a rent premium compared to comparable conventional buildings. Lower operating expenses are expected to be a major source of the rent premium that sustainable buildings command. This is especially the case for buildings with triple-net leases, where tenants directly benefit from savings in operating costs. For a large dataset of U.S. office buildings this study finds significantly lower operating expenses in LEED certified buildings. However, savings in operating expenses only explain part of the rent premium. Additional factors must be at work. Surprisingly, we find significantly higher operating expenses in Energy Star rated buildings. Hence, intangible benefits appear to be the major source of rental premiums of Energy Star rated buildings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

TI  - Energy efficiency investments in the context of split incentives among French households
AU  - Charlier, Dorothée
T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - The residential sector offers considerable potential for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly through energy-efficient renovations. The objective of this study is twofold. First, I aim to provide initial empirical evidence of the extent to which split incentives between landlords and tenants may lead to underinvestment. Second, I investigate the influence of tax credits and energy burdens on energy efficiency expenditures. Given the complexity of studying the decision to invest in energy-saving renovations, I use a bivariate Tobit model to compare decisions about energy-efficient works and repair works, even when the renovation expenditures seem quite similar. The analysis shows that tenants are doubly penalized: they have high energy expenditures due to energy-inefficient building characteristics, and because they are poorer than homeowners, they are unable to invest in energy-saving systems. The results also confirm that tax credits are ineffective in the split incentives context. In terms of public policy, the government should focus on low-income tenants, and mandatory measures such as minimum standards seem appropriate. Financial support from a third-party financer also might be a solution. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300914]

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - This paper addresses the viability of converting single-family residential buildings in Brazil into zero energy buildings (ZEBs). The European Union and the United States aim ZEBs implementation to address 'peak oil' and environmental concerns. However, literature shows no agreement on a consensual definition of ZEB. Seeking a Brazilian ZEB definition, this paper addresses PassivHaus and thermal comfort standards for hot climates, source metrics for ZEB, Brazil's energy mix, residential energy end uses and Brazilian legal framework for residential photovoltaic (PV) generation. Internal Rate of Return for PV systems in two Brazilian cities is calculated under various scenarios. It shows grid parity was reached from April 2012 to November 2012 assuming residential electric tariffs of that period and the financial conditions given by the Brazilian government for the construction of new dams in the Amazon and the lowest rates offered by Brazilian banks to private individuals. Governmental decision to lower electric residential tariffs in November 2012 reduced the scope of grid parity. Later revocation of a tax exemption in April 2013 ended grid parity in Brazil. It concludes, conversely to developed countries, it is the volatile Brazilian energy policy, instead of economical barriers, the main obstacle for ZEB viability in Brazil. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T2  - Energy policy
AB  - The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) is an important European policy tool to improve energy performance of buildings and has been applied in 27 countries with specific adjustments. The aim of this paper is to analyze the application of the Portuguese energy certification system and regulation to the residential sector using a case type, whilst considering a set of alternative and complementary solutions involving the regulation values for the envelope, interior and exterior thermal insulation, lower air renovation ratio, light colored exterior walls, better glazing system, shading elements and a Trombe Wall. In order to understand the role and the importance of bioclimatic measures in the Portuguese application of the EPBD, a comparison with the Passivhaus Norm applied to warm countries in Europe will be made. Due to the diversity of the Portuguese climate, three different climate regions were considered. Finally, we will discuss what new measures should be added to the Portuguese regulation, so that the proposed recast of the Directive might be transformed into a more effective tool in the search for better energy performance, passive house buildings and sustainable constructions.

AB  - One of the key features of environmental policy integration in Sweden is sector responsibility. The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning is responsible for the building and real estate management sector and should, as a part of this responsibility, assess the environmental impacts of this sector. The aim of this study is to suggest and demonstrate a method for such an assessment. The suggested method is a life cycle assessment, based on an input-output analysis. The method can be used for regular monitoring and for prioritization between different improving measures. For the assessment to sufficiently cover the Swedish Environmental Quality Objectives, complementary information is needed, in particular with respect to the indoor environment. According to the results, the real estate management sector contributes between 10% and 40% of Swedish energy use; use of hazardous chemical products; generation of solid waste; emissions of gases contributing to climate change; and human toxicological impacts, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates. Transport and production of nonrenewable building materials contribute significantly to several of the emissions. Heating of buildings contributes more to energy use than to climate change, due to the use of renewable energy sources. To reduce climate change, measures should therefore prioritize not only heating of buildings but also the important upstream processes.

AU  - Killip, Gavin
T2  - Environment and planning C
AB  - Work on target-led transitions has highlighted the interdependence between 'niche' and 'regime' actors in steering change towards strategic goals. Similarly, market transformation (MT) has a long history in product markets, improving the energy efficiency of stocks of energy-using appliances through research, minimum standards, energy labels, incentives, procurement, competitions, and stakeholder networks. Attempts to apply MT to buildings have failed to fully take account of the differences between appliance markets and the multiple markets which frame energy use in buildings. The case of refurbishment of UK housing is considered here, for which there is a system of different markets in operation. MT principles are considered in relation to the sources and diffusion of innovation in project-based industries; the management of different expectations among innovators and incumbents; technical risks associated with doing low-carbon refurbishment work; and the role of policy in simultaneously stimulating supply and demand. An iterative process with feedback loops and coordination is proposed to link training, standard-setting, and compliance checks. No institutional infrastructure exists for such an enterprise, which would need to cross established boundaries between regime actors. The case of UK housing refurbishment throws up lessons for theory, research, and practice which could be developed through further case studies. Reprinted by permission of Pion Limited

AB  - Issue Title: 2013 Maastricht-NUS-MIT International Real Estate Finance & Economics SymposiumThe scaling of energy efficiency initiatives in the commercial building sector has been hampered by data limitations, information asymmetries, and benchmarking methodologies that do not adequately model patterns of energy consumption, nor provide accurate measures of relative energy performance. The reliance on simple metrics, such as Energy Use Intensity (EUI), fails to account for significant variation across occupancy, construction characteristics and other elements of a building - both its design and its users - that influence building energy consumption. Using a unique dataset of actual building energy use, physical, spatial, and occupancy characteristics - collected from New York City's Local Law 84 energy disclosure database, the Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) database, and the CoStar Group - this paper analyzes energy consumption across commercial office buildings and presents a new methodology for a market-specific benchmarking model to measure relative energy performance across peer buildings. A robust predictive model is developed to normalize across multiple building characteristics and to provide the basis for a multivariate energy performance index. The paper concludes with recommendations for data collection standards, computational approaches for building energy disclosure data, and targeted policies using k-means clustering and market segmentation.

T2  - Energy policy
AB  - Ireland's housing stock has been identified as being amongst the least energy efficient in Northern Europe. Consequently, atmospheric emissions are greater than necessary. Government funded schemes have been introduced to incentivise the uptake of thermal retrofit measures in the domestic Irish market. A study of Ireland's housing highlights the dominance of detached houses (43%), 72% of which are rurally located and are predominantly heated with fuel oil. This paper investigates the economic and carbon case for thermal retrofit measures to the existing detached, oil centrally heated, rural housing stock. The study found the case for energy efficiency measures to be categorical and supports the Irish Government's focus on energy efficiency policy measures. Thermal retrofit measures in the detached housing stock have the potential to realise an averaged 65% theoretical reduction in heating costs and CO2 emissions for houses constructed prior to 1979 (coinciding with the introduction of building regulations) and around 26% for newer homes, thus offering a significant contribution (44%) to Ireland's residential carbon abatement projections and hence in meeting the EU's directives on energy and carbon. The greatest savings (36%) of Ireland's carbon abatement projections result from improving the energy efficiency of the pre 1979 stock. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] All rights reserved, Elsevier

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - This paper models the adoption of commercial building energy codes in the US between 1977 and 2006. Energy code adoption typically results in an increase in aggregate social welfare by cost effectively reducing energy expenditures. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, I test if relative state funding, a new, objective, multivariate regression-derived measure of government capacity, as well as a vector of control variables commonly used in comparative state research, predict commercial building energy code adoption. The research shows little political influence over historical commercial building energy code adoption in the sample. Colder climates and higher electricity prices also do not predict more frequent code adoptions. I do find evidence of high government capacity states being 60 percent more likely than low capacity states to adopt commercial building energy codes in the following year. Wealthier states are also more likely to adopt commercial codes. Policy recommendations to increase building code adoption include increasing access to low cost capital for the private sector and providing noncompetitive block grants to the states from the federal government.

T2  - Energy policy
AB  - Identifying the key influencing factors of CO2 emissions in China's iron and steel industry is vital for mitigating its emissions and formulating effective environmental protection measures. Most of the existing researches utilized time series data to investigate the driving factors of the industry's CO2 emission at the national level, but regional differences have not been given appropriate attention. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2000 to 2013 and panel data models to examine the key driving forces of CO2 emissions at the regional levels in China. The results show that industrialization dominates the industry's CO2 emissions, but its effect varies across regions. The impact of energy efficiency on CO2 emissions in the eastern region is greater than in the central and western regions because of a huge difference in RD investment. The influence of urbanization has significant regional differences due to the heterogeneity in human capital accumulation and real estate development. Energy structure has large potential to mitigate CO2 emissions on account of increased RD investment in energy-saving technology and expanded clean energy use. Hence, in order to effectively achieve emission reduction, local governments should consider all these factors as well as regional heterogeneity in formulating appropriate mitigation policies.

T2  - Journal of Housing and the Built Environment
AB  - In 2004, the Dutch National Sustainable Building Center set up a research project to investigate the widespread belief that sustainable building is more expensive than standard building practice. The results disproved this assumption and demonstrated that sustainable building can be financially profitable. However, the research also showed that these positive financial aspects are hardly ever used to promote sustainable building. SenterNovem initiated a new research project in order to recommend practical solutions for the identified issues. Besides the sustainable and 'regular' building sectors, the new project included other sectors in an effort to develop new insights. Focused on housing, this second project revealed the inevitability of a labeling system that covers all activities ('one language'). It recommends giving top priority to the introduction of a labeling system that translates sustainability in housing into a manageable and controllable system. The system should clearly identify the level of sustainability of a specific house. To gain acceptance among consumers, the system would have to tie in with consumer needs. The idea that many financial incentives can be linked to this labeling system was affirmed in a separate workshop. Just before the second research project was completed, the Dutch housing corporation Oost Flevoland Woondiensten (OFW) introduced a labeling system for their entire stock related to the topics of energy and health. Nine months after the launch, an assessment of this labeling system confirmed the results of the theoretical research and the workshop. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T2  - Journal of Industrial Ecology
AB  - Von Hippel and colleagues have highlighted the crucial role of users in innovation in different industries and types of products. They describe the innovation process in terms of the distinct domains of knowledge that producers and users possess. Producers have knowledge about technical solutions and users about their needs, the context of use, and their own capabilities as users. Both sets of knowledge are characterized by stickiness: They move relatively freely within their own domain but are difficult to transfer outside of it. In the case of radical innovations for sustainable consumption, the problem of sticky information is compounded. Both producers and consumers need to reach out of their conventional competencies and search for new solutions. Societal actors, such as government bodies or environmental experts, can show the way to such solutions, but this new knowledge needs to be integrated with the sticky knowledge about everyday practices in production and consumption. In the present article we attempt to conceptualize the role and interaction of user and producer knowledge with the knowledge of environmental experts in housing energy innovations. We do so by applying the user-producer interaction framework to a case study on the introduction of low-energy housing concepts in Finland. On the basis of this analysis, we draw conclusions on the potential and limitations of today's practices in the field. For example, we suggest that user involvement can help to enhance the acceptance of low-energy solutions but that the methods for involving users need to be adapted to the particular circumstances in each industry.

We analyze clusters of certified green and nearby buildings, establishing that 'rated' buildings command substantially higher rents and selling prices than otherwise identical buildings. Variations in premiums are systematically related to energy-saving characteristics. Increased energy efficiency is associated with increased selling prices -- beyond the premiums paid for a labeled building. Evidence suggests that the intangible effects of the label itself may also play a role in determining the values of green buildings in the marketplace. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Green properties achieve on-average higher occupancies and prices / sf compared to non-green properties. The hedonic, repeat-sale, and transaction frequency models applied provide evidence of the price "bubble" in 2006-07 and the importance of green designation. LEED properties sold for a 23% price / sf premium, while an ENERGY STAR designation had no effect. Also, LEED Class A properties transacted 68% less than non-LEED, while ENERGY STAR Class B properties transacted 23% more than non-ENERGY STAR. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that significant capital expenditures for achieving a greener property require longer cost recovery holding periods.

This paper reports on a recently completed empirical study for the Swiss residential sector. It empirically quantifies the marginal costs of energy efficiency investments (i.e. additional insulation, improved window systems, ventilation and heating systems and architectural concepts). For the private sector, first results on the economic valuation of co-benefits such as improved comfort of living, improved indoor air quality, better protection against external noise, etc. may amount to the same order of magnitude as the energy-related benefits are given. The costbenefit analysis includes newly developed technologies that show large variations in prices due to pioneer market pricing, add-on of learning costs and risk components of the installers. Based on new empirical data on the present cost-situation and past techno-economic progress, the potential of future cost reduction was estimated applying the experience curve concept. The paper shows, for the first time, co-benefits and cost dynamics of energy efficiency investments, of which decision makers in the real estate sector, politics and administrations are scarcely aware.

AB  - Cilj ovog istraživanja bio je empirijski istražiti utjecaj potrošnje obnovljivih i neobnovljivih izvora energije na ekonomski rast. Analiza je provedena na podacima za 16 razvijenih EU država u razdoblju od 1990. do 2018. te za 11 posttranzicijskih EU država u razdoblju od 1995. do 2018. Dobiveni rezultati usporeðeni su s rezultatima dobivenim za razdoblje do 2014.godine. Za kvantificiranje kratkoročnog i dugoročnog utjecaja, primijenjen je združeni procjenitelj aritmetičke sredine grupe (PMG). Prema empirijskim rezultatima potrošnja oba izvora energije u dugom roku značajno utječe na ekonomski rast u obje skupine zemalja. Meðutim, rezultati se razlikuju izmeðu razvijenih i posttranzicijskih EU zemalja. U razvijenim EU zemljama potrošnja obnovljivih izvora energije ima negativan utjecaj na ekonomski rast, dok potrošnja neobnovljivih izvora energije ima pozitivan utjecaj. U post-tranzicijskim EU zemljama rezultati su suprotni, što znači da u tim zemljama postoji tendencija prelaska s manje učinkovitih i onečišćujućih izvora energije na učinkovitije energetske opcije koje mogu biti poticaj ekonomskom rastu.

AB  - Vowing to pump $150 billion into green technology over the next decade, US Pres Barack Obama has made big promises about his environmental agenda. Even the US Congress is considering a range of measures to reduce greenhouse gases -- from regulatory mandates, such as raising vehicle fuel economy or requiring electric utilities to produce more of their power from renewable sources, to carbon taxes and a cap-and-trade system for electric utilities. China is now pumping more than 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere each year, to say nothing of the sulfur dioxide and particulates that pose a major public health threat. Amid soaring energy costs, Germany and Spain cut back on their solar subsidies; now, many producers are struggling to survive on their own. Today, all over the world, cities with high quality of life and high environmental quality feature higher housing prices and less out-migration of skilled workers than nearby cities with a lower quality of life.

T2  - Energy policy
AB  - Requiring energy efficiency building codes raises housing prices (or the monthly rental equivalent), but theoretically this effect might be fully offset by reductions in household energy expenditures. Whether there is a full compensating differential or how much households are paying implicitly is an empirical question. This study estimates the net implicit price of energy efficient buildings codes, IECC 2003 through IECC 2006, for American households. Using sample data from the American Community Survey 2007, a heteroskedastic seemingly unrelated estimation approach is used to estimate hedonic price (house rent) and energy expenditure models. The value of energy efficiency building codes is capitalized into housing rents, which are estimated to increase by 23.25 percent with the codes. However, the codes provide households a compensating differential of about a 6.47 percent reduction (about $7.71) in monthly energy expenditure. Results indicate that the mean household net implicit price for these codes is about $140.87 per month in 2006 dollars ($163.19 in 2013 dollars). However, this estimated price is shown to vary significantly by region, energy type and the rent gradient. All rights reserved, Elsevier

T2  - Tourism Economics
AB  - This study examines the effects of green or eco-friendly certificates and awards on consumers' perceived value within the hotel industry, and the roles of consumers' perceived value in predicting satisfaction, intention to revisit, and intention to pay a green premium. The results of partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis from a sample of 250 guests in Sri Lankan hotels showed that our unified model includes a satisfactory level of prediction power to test the hypothesized relationships. Green certificates and green awards positively affect consumers' perceived value within the hotel industry. The findings also supported the relationship between consumers' perceived value and satisfaction, intention to revisit, and intention to pay a green premium. The empirical findings in the context of Sri Lanka provide another important insight which confirms the positive effects of green certification and green awards on consumers' perceived value and behavioral intentions, such as their intention to revisit and to pay a premium.

AU  - Carlsson-Kanyama, Annika
T2  - International Journal of Sustainable Development
AB  - In theory, food handling in collaborative housing systems could have a number of environmental advantages compared with households and food service institutions. This paper explores to what extent some of these theoretical advantages are realised in two collaborative housing units in a major Swedish city. Food-related energy use and waste flows were measured and compared with results from food service institutions and some data relevant for households. Results show that energy use for cooking decreases in collaborative houses compared with households but energy use for food storage increases. Plate and food preparation wastes are low in the studied collaborative houses but food leftovers may be abundant. The latter result depends on how the dining system is organised. A bottleneck for improving the environmental efficiency in collaborative housing is the static view of apartment design held by many architects and real estate owners. Another bottleneck may be the unwillingness of households to make advance commitments to daily dining. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Blair Wimbush, NS vice president  for real estate and the railroads corporate sustainability officer, said setting its emission-reduction goal is an important step toward fulfillment of Norfolk Southern's objective to achieve industry leadership in environmentally responsible business practices. Disclosing our carbon footprint last year was the first step. Now, we move forward with an aggressive yet realistic goal, and we have the tools to measure our progress toward attaining it."In 2009, NS hauled 158.5 billion ton-miles of freight, producing 4.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases mainly from its diesel-burning locomotives. That produced emissions per revenue ton-mile of 30 grams. Cutting emissions 10 percent in five years would bring them to 27 grams per revenue ton-mile for the same freight volume, NS said, and put 475,000 fewer metric tons into the atmosphere a year by 2014.

T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - There is a growing interest in a sustainable built environment and green technologies are gaining worldwide attention. However, implementing green technologies usually requires more investment than using traditional technologies and the payback period tends to be very long. In China, most developers sell their properties and subsequently transfer the ownership to customers. Hence, a crucial problem for promoting green construction is that developers cannot obtain economic profits (“gold”) from implementing “green” technologies. Meanwhile, other stakeholders, such as property management companies, are also hesitant to adopt green technologies because of the large investment involved and their lack of experience. To tackle this problem, an energy performance contracting (EPC) based framework is proposed, to turn “green” investment into “gold” benefit by careful sharing of the risks existed. The framework was developed by conducting a focus group meeting with three experienced representatives from developer, property management company and energy service company respectively. A real-life case study, which includes both energy efficient system retrofit and new construction, is used to estimate the costs and benefits involved to demonstrate and verify the conceptual framework. The results show that the proposed framework can support the application of green technologies in both types of projects. Economic benefits as well as environmental benefits can be gained for the project stakeholders and the whole society. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AU  - Zheng, Siqi

T2  - Journal of Economic Perspectives
AB  - Over the last 30 years, China's economy has boomed. This trend has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty but it has also sharply increased local, regional, and global pollution levels. We look at the rise in air pollution over recent decades, and the perhaps surprising finding that in many of China's urban areas, levels of particulates (of less than 10 microns) have been decreasing during the last 10 to 15 years. We then turn to the costs and tradeoffs of air pollution, including costs to human health, reductions in worker productivity, and how people are seeking to reduce their exposure to pollution as shown by compensating differentials in real estate prices and purchases of masks and air filters. We discuss how rising incomes tend to raise the demand for environmental amenities and thus increase political pressure for environmental protection, and then we turn to the policy tools that China has used to reduce pollution. We conclude by arguing that as China's government is preparing for an additional 300 million people to move to urban areas over the next 30 years, it will have a number of opportunities for China to reduce pollution through a shift from manufacturing to services, along with various steps to improve energy efficiency and resource conservation. Overall, it seems that China is on track to improve its environmental performance in the years ahead. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AU  - Binkley, Aaron G.
AU  - Ciochetti, Brian A.
T2  - Journal of Sustainable Real Estate
AB  - Real estate is one of the largest contributors to CO2 emissions yet the industry knows very little about this topic. This paper provides a background on carbon markets and their potential role in a proposed strategy for energy efficiency improvements (EEI). It compares the relationship between an investment decision based solely on electricity prices to one that incorporates the monetary benefit associated with carbon offsets. The findings suggest that a regulated carbon 'cap and trade' system could provide additional value to property owners who pursue EEI strategies. Moreover, carbon offset value differs significantly by geographic location and method by which electrical energy is produced. EEI strategies that take into account carbon offset value could significantly reduce the impact that commercial real estate has on the environment.

AU  - Blonz, Joshua

AU  - Walls, Margaret A.
AB  - Uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic of climate change. This paper focuses on uncertainty that is introduced in the implementation of policy, especially as it affects the level and distribution of the burden on households that results from the allocation of emissions allowances. We examine the Waxman-Markey bill (H.R. 2454), with bookend scenarios labeled optimistic and pessimistic. The scenarios vary outcomes associated with allocations to local distribution companies, investments in electricity energy efficiency and technology development. We introduce a third scenario that allocates a substantial portion of allowance value directly to households. We find the average consumer surplus loss per household in 2016 in the optimistic scenario to be $136 and the allowance price is as low as $13.20 per ton. In the pessimistic scenario, the consumer surplus loss rises to $413, with an allowance price of $23.43 per ton. Allocation of allowance value directly back to households provides an intermediate, but more certain, result.

The Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM) has remarked the unrealistic concept of developing and retrofitting buildings to zero-net energy standards. Thus, Senators were debating the Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 requiring energy-efficiency improvements and electricity consumption standards in federal and commercial buildings. However, a bi-partisan bill creating the Low Carbon Economy Act was introduced which would provide monetary incentives for greenhouse gas producers who could reduce carbon emissions to 60 percent if approved.

AB  - Purpose: The article presents the actual problem of determining cost of construction project implementation. Within the conducted research, an analysis of existing approaches to managing project costs in the face of uncertainty was carried out, including the justification of the possibility of using the contract system for the purpose of optimizing the project, as well as identification of possibilities of cost engineering. Design/methodology/approach: A Case-study method, based on an assessment of the performance indicators of an investment project for the construction of a city boiler house and the project cost analysis using the Earned Value Technique, was used to prove the hypothesis about the effectiveness of using cost engineering. Findings: The results of evaluating the effectiveness of project implementation was substantiated, and the feasibility of applying the EPC contract for the cost optimization was proven. The projects implemented with the EPC contracts have a high potential. EPC/M contracts are widely used in other countries, but in Russia, this type of contract is just beginning to be used. Originality/value: In the result of the analysis, it was revealed that the main factors affecting the cost of the boiler house implementation construction project were the imperfection of the pricing system, the presence of unrecorded work and costs, the inadequacy of the rationing system; the violation of technology and timing of implementation.

AB  - This cost-benefit analysis study considered energy-efficiency measures in low-cost housing, primarily standard 30 m[sup 2] Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) houses. The three packages of interventions that improve the thermal performance of the houses (ceilings, roof and wall insulation, windows and partitions) were found to be economically attractive both from a national and a household perspective. The net benefits from the whole package for a standard RDP home is about 10 per cent of the value of the housing subsidy provided by the government. The same interventions applied to informal housing appear more costly because the lifespan of shacks is taken to be five years. Row houses are particularly attractive, although their social acceptability requires further study. Compact fluorescent lamps and solar water heating are also attractive because of the energy savings they deliver. Apart from saving money, all these measures improve the quality of life of households by increasing comfort and decreasing indoor air pollution. Although the measures have a net social benefit, it does not mean that poor people can afford them. Energy-efficiency measures tend to have high capital costs, while the benefits are spread over many years. With their high discount rates, consumers are often not able to wait for future savings, nor do they have access to capital for investment. Based on our analysis, however, a capital subsidy of between R1 000 and R2 000 (not the full capital cost) is all that would be required to make these measures attractive to poor households across a range of regions and income groups. The no-cost measures of northern orientations: climatically correct window size and placement, as well as the appropriate wall and roof colour have a thermal running cost and environmental impact.

AB  - In order to further mitigate negative environmental impact, the European Union (EU) has adopted the so called "20-20-20" goals, in which a (primary) energy reduction target is included. Subsequently, the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for buildings (via the Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings) has been implemented in EU member states. In this paper, we examine the impact of EPCs on office revenues. By and large, we find that better EPC ratings have a positive and significant effect on revenues. This research area is important as improved energy efficiency in the built environment is necessary in order to reach the EU reduction target.

AB  - Key words like sustainability, green building, energy efficiency, triple bottom line, and corporate social responsibility increasingly affect the real estate business and therefore most of the related decision making processes. But what effect does sustainability have on property market values? A lot of discussion and research has already been undertaken to analyze possible impacts of sustainable characteristics on property values. Until now, little significant quantitative empirical evidence has been found, and if so, it s usually related to US real estate markets and the sustainability certifications of LEED and Energy Star. In 2002, the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was adopted to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. The IMMOVALUE-project, granted by the program of Intelligent Energy Europe, analyzed the possibility of implementing characteristics of energy efficiency into property valuation practice using data from the mandatory energy-performance certificates. One result of the project was that if detailed property market data are available, multiple regression analysis in the framework of hedonic pricing models could be applied to consider, and empirically establish, the effects of energy efficiency characteristics on properties values. This article focuses on the possibility of integrating aspects of energy efficiency into income-related property valuation approaches. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Energy Codes and the Landlord-Tenant Problem
AU  - Papineau, Maya M.
AB  - I estimate the energy efficiency premium in unlabeled office buildings by exploiting variation in mandatory building energy standard implementations, as a result of the U.S. 1992 Energy Policy Act. A more stringent energy code leads to rent and price premiums of approximately 4% and 9%, respectively. Significant heterogeneity in the rent premium is observed based on who pays the utility bills, as would be expected absent asymmetric information about energy conservation characteristics among real estate market participants. The rent and price premiums are larger in hotter, more humid climates, and are consistent with full capitalization of the energy savings from a more stringent standard.

TI  - Energy Codes and the Landlord-Tenant Problem
AU  - Papineau, Maya
AB  - This paper assesses whether commercial real estate participants are willing to pay a premium for an energy efficient building that has not received a green label. I utilize a unique dataset of detailed building-level observations and a spatial semiparametric matching framework that exploits quasi-experimental state-by-year variation in the implementation of mandatory building energy codes, to estimate selling price and rent premiums for a more stringent code. I find that buildings constructed under a more stringent energy code are associated with rent and selling price premiums of approximately 2.7% and 10%, respectively, compared to buildings constructed just before the code came into effect. When tenants pay directly for utilities, buildings constructed under an energy code are associated with 5.7% higher rents. These premiums are consistent with complete capitalization of estimated building-level savings, and there forecast doubt on the existence of an energy efficiency gap resulting from adverse selection between landlords and tenants in commercial buildings.

Benchmarking the performance of these improvements is discussed through an explanation of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. A series of projects for which investment in EEI has been conducted are reviewed. While data limitations preclude the ability to generalize our results, we believe they demonstrate an area of real estate investment that should not be overlooked. The findings should appeal to owners and operators of commercial real estate, as well as tenants who occupy space in these buildings.

TI  - Energy efficiency retrofits in the residential sector – analysing tenants' cost burden in a German field study.
AU  - Weber, Ines

T2  - Energy Policy
AB  - Abstract With the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and curbing climate change, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings with energy efficiency retrofits is an important task. In Germany a large share of the residential building stock is rented. This comes with barriers to energy efficiency retrofitting due to split incentive problems. Alongside existing government incentive programmes, the German tenancy law allows landlords to add a maximum of 11% of the energy-related modernisation costs onto the annual rent. Studies evaluating the actual outcomes, from an energy as well as a social point of view, are rare. This article compares calculated theoretical heating energy consumption for prior to and after retrofit with actual consumption data after retrofit. Further, the issue of household expenses is addressed by comparing increased rental costs after retrofit with household's energy expenses prior and after retrofit. Despite a reduction in energy consumption of 70%, more than half of the households faced increased costs due to higher rents after retrofit. Even when increases in energy prices are taken into account, still one third of the households faced higher costs. For a fairer and more effective distribution of costs and benefits, this article stresses the importance of alternative financing models. Highlights • Tenants often do not profit from energy efficiency retrofits in financial terms. • Households with low energy consumption are disproportionately affected. • Alternative financing models are needed for more efficient and fair retrofit policies.

TI  - Energy Price Reform and Household Welfare: The Case of Turkey.
AU  - Fan Zhang
T2  - Energy Journal
AB  - A price reform in Turkey increased the residential electricity tariff by more than 50 percent in 2008. The reform, aimed at encouraging energy efficiency and private investment, sparked considerable policy debate about its potential impact on household welfare. This paper estimates a short-run residential electricity demand function to evaluate the distributional impact of the tariff increase. The analysis allows heterogeneity in households' price sensitivity and the model is estimated using a nationally representative sample of 8,572 Turkish households. The results suggest that rich households in Turkey are three times as responsive in adjusting consumption to price changes as poor households are. In addition, the welfare loss of the poorest income quintile--measured by the change in consumer surplus as a percentage of income--is 2.9 times that of the wealthiest. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Essays in Energy and Environmental Economics
AU  - Nasseri, Iman
AB  - This dissertation is comprised of three essays on energy and environmental economics. The first two essays of this dissertation examine sectoral energy consumption in the State of Hawai'i. My first essay focuses on the intermediate demand for energy consumption by economic sectors. I model Hawai'i's economy in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework and follow the footprint of efficiency improvement in the economy by looking at the energy flows in Hawai'i's economy. Assuming a "free" technological change becoming available to firms, this essay ranks the economic sectors with respect to their saving potential. While there are currently some energy efficiency rules and incentives in place, this essay provides insights to design alternative sector-specific energy efficiency policies that could help to achieve the State's goals. My results identify hotels, construction, accommodations, restaurants, and retail trade as the key sectors to be targeted for a successful sector-specific energy efficiency program. The above-mentioned sectors together comprise 56% of total potential reduction in energy use and GHG emissions in Hawai'i's economy. In the second essay, I turn my attention to final energy consumers, contributing toward the understanding of electricity and fuel use associated with residents and visitors of Hawai'i. Using an Input-Output model, I analyze the difference in total energy consumption--both direct purchases and indirect demand for energy through purchases of other goods and services--of residents and visitors. I run the same analysis using both 2007 and 1997 data set to compare the consumption pattern change over time. My results show that on a per-capita basis, residents tend to consume more electricity through spending on health services, real estate rentals, professional services, and trade, while top visitor electricity-intensive expenditures include hotel, restaurants, trade (shopping), and tourism services (museums, tours and travel agencies). The results for 1997 and 2007 show a remarkable difference between residents and visitors: while total demand for fuels and electricity increased by 18% and 33%, respectively, for residents, they both fell by 4% and 9%, respectively, for visitors. Adjusting for population change, per-capita results reveal the same pattern but different magnitudes. Therefore, I conclude that the tourism industry has improved efficiency in both fuel and electricity usages by decreasing energy intensity of their activities over the observed decade. During the observed 10-year period, energy-use visitor factor dropped for fuel from 3.5 to 2.5 (a 28% drop) and for electricity from 2.4 to 1.5 (a 38% drop). Finally, to assess the underlying driving forces influencing the observed changes in energy consumption in Hawai'i, I used a decomposition methodology to explain the changes in sectoral energy demand between 1997 and 2007 in terms of activity, structure, and intensity effects. The findings indicate that the activity effect contributed greatly to the observed growth in energy consumption, that the structural effect was small, and that the reduction in energy intensity by sector was a clear signal of improvement in energy efficiency. Finally, in my third essay, I look into the controversial topic of climate policy under uncertainty. The literature on hybrid climate policy could be divided in two groups: studies of one group discuss the welfare-enhancing features of hybrid policies in a qualitative framework, while the others compare the policies by measuring welfare loss in a stochastic dynamic setting. My third essay seeks to contribute to the literature by providing a theoretical welfare analysis for optimal hybrid policy under uncertainty. Moreover, I contribute to the U.S. climate policy literature using a numerical example. In this essay, I bypass the conventional price and quantity mechanisms and focus on the two common hybrid policies: Two-Step Carbon Tax as a price-driven mechanism, and Cap-and-Trade with Allowance Reserve, as a quantity-driven mechanism. I first solve for the optimal policy parameters in the context of climate change and then set the model's parameters to U.S.-specific values to quantify the solutions and compare them with respect to their expected welfare loss. The numerical analysis ranks the two-step tax policy above the cap-and-trade with allowance reserve in terms of social welfare loss, given the same cost and uncertainty parameters.

AU  - Spurlock, Cecily Anna
AB  - In this dissertation I explore two aspects of the economics of energy. The first focuses on consumer behavior, while the second focuses on market structure and firm behavior. In the first chapter, I demonstrate evidence of loss aversion in the behavior of households on two critical peak pricing experimental tariffs while participating in the California Statewide Pricing Pilot. I develop a model of loss aversion over electricity expenditure from which I derive two sets of test able predictions. First, I show that when there is a higher probability that a household is in the loss domain of their value function for the bill period, the more strongly they cut back peak consumption. Second, when prices are such that households are close to the kink in their value function--and would otherwise have expenditure skewed into the loss domain--I show evidence of disproportionate clustering at the kink. In essence this means that the occurrence of critical peak days did not only result in a reduction of peak consumption on that day, but also spilled over to further reduction of peak consumption on regular peak days for several weeks thereafter. This was similarly true when temperatures were high during high priced periods. This form of demand adjustment resulted in households experiencing bill-period expenditures equal to what they would have paid on the standard non-dynamic pricing tariff at a disproportionate rate. This higher number of bill periods with equal expenditure displaced bill periods in which they otherwise would have paid more than if they were on standard pricing. In the second chapter, I explore the effects of two simultaneous changes in minimum energy efficiency and Energy Star standards for clothes washers. Adapting the Mussa and Rosen (1978) and Ronnen (1991) second-degree price discrimination model, I demonstrate that clothes washer prices and menus adjusted to the new standards in patterns consistent with a market in which firms had been price discriminating. In particular, I show evidence of discontinuous price drops at the time the standards were imposed, driven largely by mid-low efficiency segments of the market. The price discrimination model predicts this result. On the other hand, under perfect competition, prices should increase for these market segments. Additionally, new models proliferated in the highest efficiency market segment following the standard changes. Finally, I show that firms appeared to use different adaptation strategies at the two instances of the standards changing.

AB  - This dissertation is composed of four chapters. The first chapter provides an overview of my dissertation and summarizes the key results of the proceeding chapters. The second chapter, which I title "Consumer Heterogeneity and the Energy Paradox," analyzes how households value energy efficiency when they buy a new car. The third chapter, titled "Designing Efficient Markets for Carbon Offsets with Distributional Constraints," studies the relative efficacy of three policies--baselines, trade ratios and limits--for alleviating the problem of adverse selection in markets for carbon offsets. The forth chapter, currently titled "On the Importance of Baseline Setting in Markets for Carbon Offsets," evaluates the relative magnitudes of over-credited, non-additional offsets and under-credited emissions reductions. The second chapter presents an analysis of the energy paradox with a focus on how consumers vary in their preferences for energy cost savings. By formulating a mixed logit discrete choice model of new vehicle demand that accounts for unobserved product characteristics, I estimate the distribution of household willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reducing gasoline costs by one dollar. While I find that the average household puts equal weight on vehicle price and fuel cost, I find significant heterogeneity in WTP where a non-trivial fraction of households appear to be inattentive to fuel cost differences. Encouraging these households to fully value fuel costs generates welfare gains that are on the same order of magnitude as the cost of increasing fuel economy standards. By calibrating a simple model of the new vehicle market, I find, however, that existing policies for increasing fuel economy fall short of realizing these gains because the policies influence the purchase decisions of all households, including those that fully or overvalue fuel costs. The third chapter presents an assessment of the relative efficacy of three key instruments--baselines, trade ratios and limits--which are under policy discussion in the design of carbon offset programs. We rank the instruments by their implications for total emissions, economic efficiency, and efficiency gain relative to a distributional transfer from capped to uncapped sectors. We find that the baseline is the best instrument for maximizing welfare as it directly reduces the share of offsets that are non-additional and that second-best policies do not sacrifice much welfare relative to the standard first-best policy prescription. In the fourth chapter, I develop a unified framework that considers the supply of offsets within a cap-and-trade program that allows us to compare of the relative impact of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions on overall emissions under different levels of baseline stringency and carbon prices. I find that the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets can be fully balanced out by under-credited emissions reductions without sacrificing a significant portion of the overall supply of offsets, provided emissions baselines are stringent enough. Under a medium-run reduction target of two billion tons of CO2 equivalent, to maintain the environmental integrity of the program, baselines need to be set to 70 percent of predicted business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. Moreover, as the carbon market achieves higher equilibrium prices, less stringent baselines can balance out the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions.

AB  - Manuscript 1 is titled, "Household demand for water in rural Kenya", and is coauthored with Joseph Cook and Peter Kimuyu. In this manuscript we use a household survey from 387 households in rural Kenya to model source choice and water demand using a discrete-continuous (linked) demand model. We find that households are sensitive to the price, proximity, taste, and availability in choosing among sources, but are not sensitive to other source qualities including color, health risk, and risk of conflict. We use the linked demand framework to estimate own-price elasticities in the rural setting. These range between -0.13 and -1.33, with a mean of -0.56, consistent with other estimates from small and large cities. Manuscript 2 is titled, "Energy efficiency information asymmetries in the rental housing market", and is a solo work. In this manuscript I exploit the variation in payment-status (who pays the energy bill), to estimate the effect of information asymmetries on the adoption of efficient (Energy Star rated) technologies in the U.S. rental housing market. Results show that, contrary to previous findings, landlords who pay their tenant's energy bill are no more likely to install energy efficient technologies, suggesting that information asymmetries play a nominal role in the adoption of efficient technologies in the rental housing market. Manuscript 3 is titled, "A linked-demand model to characterize multiple discrete-continuous demand", and is coauthored with Joseph Cook. In this manuscript we develop a reduced form multiple discrete-continuous demand model. Using this model we analyze weekly household demand for water in rural Ethiopia, and characterize four important aspects of demand: (1) total household water demand, (2) source-specific household demand, (3) aggregate water demand at each source, and (4) household preferences across source attributes. Results show that households value water quality, proximity and price in choosing which sources to collect from. Average own-price elasticity estimates from the aggregate demand analysis are found to be -0.18, and are consistent with other own-price elasticity estimates from middle- and low-income countries.

TI  - Essays in Non-market Valuation of Environmental Impacts
AU  - Park, Ju Young
AB  - In my dissertation, I measure the value of non-market amenities such as environmental quality using the hedonic pricing method in all three chapters. In Chapter 2, the study examines the price premium from Korea's Energy Efficiency Grade Label. The Korean government recently began energy certification of televisions, providing a setting to analyze a possible price effect of the new label. Hedonic regression results seem to show that a price premium exists for products with the Energy Efficiency Grade Label. However, potential unobserved heterogeneity is a concern. Difference-in-difference and fixed-effects models are used to capture the net effect of the label by controlling for time and product differences. The results suggest that any price premium does not result from the energy efficiency label itself. Instead, energy-efficient products already had higher prices before the introduction of the energy efficiency label. The finding turns our attention to the importance of careful design of labeling programs. In Chapter 3, using the publicly available housing transaction data in Korea, the study estimates a fixed-effects model to examine the impact of industrial park openings on the housing market in Korea. This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, the availability of multiple transactions within apartment complexes makes it feasible to carry out a fixed-effects estimation and address unobserved heterogeneity across apartment complexes. Second, I trace the effect on housing values from the announcement stage to actual operation stage of industrial parks. Third, although most previous studies analyze U.S. housing market, I examine the Korean housing market. I find that people in general have positive expectations about parks opening at the time of announcement, but they do not want to be located in close proximity to the park. Furthermore, the housing price effects of announcement and actual start of operation differ. Local households react positively to the news of industrial park openings and remain positive by the time parks begin operation, but households in close proximity to industrial parks react relatively less positively at the time of announcement, and the decline in price premium becomes greater once parks begin operation. In Chapter 4, I examine the price effect of the Fukushima nuclear accident on the Korean housing market. The Fukushima nuclear disaster triggered by the earthquake and tsunami was an unfortunate accident that is recorded as the worst nuclear accident since the Chernobyl accident. Given the proximity of South Korea to Japan, Koreans were particularly more concerned about the severity of the accident and its environmental and health impacts. Uncertain events such as the Fukushima nuclear accident may cause households to re-evaluate the likelihood of environmental hazard and decrease the values of housing units that are located near the facilities. Current study analyzes how the Korean housing market responds to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, using publicly available housing transactions data. The study compares the prices of apartments located in the nuclear plant-possessing districts with those of the apartments located in adjacent districts. The results indicate that in reaction to the news of disaster in Japan, housing prices decreased radically in those districts with nuclear power plants.

AB  - Green building concept represents an important issue in Romania mainly after 2008, encouraged by rulings related to green buildings and also with 2020 strategy which are encouraging a trend of investment in this kind of buildings having in mind goals such as energy performance, energy efficiency, renewable energy and construction waste (or externalities). After a conceptual phase, people in Romania (inclusively investors in real estate) have shown, both as consumers and as society, an interest for green buildings, and so this is a big opportunity for real estate developers to extend their businesses. Our paper is focusing on what represents demand and offer in Romanian green buildings market. This increasing interest of real estate developers for green buildings makes up a new business perspective in Romania, as they have now through this a possibility to increase the value of their investment and in the same time but also to produce a type of more energy-effective buildings, with reduced ownerships costs. In conclusion, this paper highlights benefits of green buildings, in terms of reducing costs but also in terms of sustainability of the building. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Green housing transition in the Chinese housing market: A behavioural analysis of real estate enterprises.
AU  - Jiang, Han
AU  - Payne, Sarah
T2  - Journal of Cleaner Production
AB  - The concept of green housing has been introduced in China to deal with climate issues in the housing sector. Green housing development requires a complex socio-technical transition based not just on green materials or technologies, but also, and most importantly, on the behavioural transition of housing market actors. Little is known about how Chinese real estate enterprises are responding to the green housing transition within a Chinese context. Addressing this gap, our research aims to determine whether, and to what, extent Chinese real estate enterprises are transitioning toward greener housing practices and what constraints may exist. This research gap is particularly pressing given the Chinese government's ambitions to promote energy efficiency in the new urban building sector by requiring 50% of urban new buildings to be green buildings by 2020 (NDRC, 2016). Our research reveals Chinese real estate enterprises face a dilemma of 'going green' and a range of institutional constraints that currently frustrate their uptake of green housing practices. Our research furthers knowledge on environmental and housing market governance within non-western and non-liberal contexts. • A stylised representation of the housing market as a specific institutional ensemble is depicted. • A range of institutional constraints to the green housing transition were identified. • Real estate enterprises face a dilemma of 'going green'. • A clear policy pathway should guide future market action to ensure long-term institutional change.

TI  - HOW DOES THE ROMANIAN STATE SUPPORT THE INCREASE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF BUILDINGS BY USING PUBLIC FUNDS?
AU  - Liliana, BARBU
T2  - Studies in Business & Economics
AB  - The issue of improving the energy efficiency of buildings in Romania is one of interest, both for the state authorities and for the population. The general purpose is to encourage the production of thermal energy and domestic hot water through the use of renewable energy sources. This is part of the EU's long-term objective of decarbonising the existing and inefficient European real estate park. In order to start renovating the existing buildings on the national territory, considerable financial resources are needed which the owners should have. The Romanian state, through the Agency for Environmental Protection, comes to the support the interested persons by granting financial support within the "Green House" Programs. The present paper includes an analysis of the four "Green House" programs and the public funds used to increase the energy efficiency of the buildings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Journal of Corporate Real Estate
AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to propose a decision support tool that would aid decision-makers to implement energy-saving measures efficiently in a corporate real estate. Design/methodology/approach – The tool consists of a system dynamic model that allows describing and quantifying the complex interaction between potential maintenance scenarios, external energy factors and case-specific conditions. In addition, to include the uncertainty of some of the input variables related to the external energy factors, Monte Carlo simulation has been applied. Findings – A case study of a city hall in The Netherlands showed the usability of the proposed tool. Over the selected period of 20 years, applying the chosen set of interventions, the simulation showed possible gains in the net present value and significant decrease of energy consumption and carbon emission. Municipal officials and consultants verified the tool for energy efficiency. Research limitations/implications – Although the tool has proved its functionality in one case study, to test its robustness, additional case studies would be preferable. Practical implications – The assessment tool can help organizations in assessing energy-efficient maintenance scenarios that include multiple technical energy efficiency interventions as a part of other maintenance activities. Originality/value – There are numerous ways to increase building’s energy efficiency, but a lack of knowledge is often hindering the enhancement of maximal benefits. A tool that would assess both financial and environmental benefits of potential technical intervention would provide useful insights into corporate’s real estate current and possible future energy performance. This would aid corporations in making better decisions regarding finances, and on the long run, it will bring an improved corporate image. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Incentives to (not) Disclose Energy Performance Information in the Housing Market
AU  - Cornago, Elisabetta
AU  - Dressler, Luisa
AB  - Disclosure of energy performance certificates (EPCs) is often incomplete, which hampers their effectiveness in relieving information asymmetries between landlords and tenants in the housing market. Even when a certificate is available, landlords do not always disclose it. This contradicts the unraveling result, according to which all landlords should disclose quality information unless it is costly to do so. We leverage a cross-sectional dataset of residential rental advertisements from the Belgian region of Brussels to empirically evaluate incentives to disclose an EPC. We find that two fundamental assumptions for the unraveling result are not confirmed in our setting: tenants value energy performance of rental property only when dwellings are of very high quality and do not appear to rationally adjust their expectations when faced with dwellings that withhold their EPC. The paper formulates specific policy advice for reforming EPC mechanisms to increase disclosure rates.

Centered on the Financial District in Toronto, Ontario, I integrate the existing literature, interviews, and local case studies to indicate the current environment for whole building energy efficiency reductions. Recognizing deep retrofits as relatively new to the commercial real estate market, my ideas and recommendations include: corporate social responsibility reporting to build tenant demand; an easily accessible national energy labelling system; improving tools for benchmarking and industry knowledge; and providing innovative financial incentives.

T2  - Journal of Property Management
AB  - The article focuses on the energy efficiency improvements lobbied by the Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM) members in the U.S. Congress. Climate change is the top environmental issue in Congress as a result, the Administration and the Congress will likely make it a priority to pass legislation leading to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The measure could impact the cost of building new and renovating existing buildings as well as the cost of operating multifamily and commercial structures. Measure to extend the energy efficient tax credits beyond the end of fiscal year 2008 has been progressing in Congress. IREM believes that incentives for energy-efficiency investments are the best way to promote conservation.

TI  - Is California More Energy Efficient than the Rest of the Nation? Evidence from Commercial Real Estate
AU  - Kahn, Matthew E.
AU  - Kok, Nils
AU  - Liu, Peng
AB  - California's per-capita electricity consumption is 50 percent lower than national per-capita consumption. Mild climate, deindustrialization, and its demographics explain part of this differential. California energy efficiency policy is often claimed to be another key factor. A challenge in judging this claim is the heterogeneity of the real estate capital stock. Residential homes differ along a large number of physical attributes. We access a proprietary dataset from a large hotel chain that allows us to evaluate the environmental performance of comparable commercial real estate across the United States. Controlling for climate conditions and geographic location, we document that California's commercial real estate stock is the most energy efficient at a point in time but this differential is quantitatively small. However, over the years 2007 to 2013, California's hotels achieved much greater energy efficiency progress than hotels in other states.

TI  - Is Energy Efficiency Capitalized into Home Prices? Evidence from Three US Cities
AU  - Walls, Margaret
AU  - Palmer, Karen
AU  - Gerarden, Todd
AB  - We look for evidence of capitalization of energy efficiency features in home prices using data from real estate multiple listing services (MLS) in three metropolitan areas: the Research Triangle region of North Carolina; Austin, Texas; and Portland, Oregon. These home listings include information on Energy Star certification and, in Portland and Austin, local green certifications. Our results suggest that Energy Star certification increases the sales prices of homes built between 1995 and 2006 but has no statistically significant effect on sales prices for newer homes. The local certifications appear to have larger effects on sales prices, and that effect holds for both newer and older homes. The estimated home price premiums from certification imply annual energy cost savings that are sizeable fractions of estimated annual energy costs for homes in our sample, in some cases even above 100 percent. This suggests that the certifications either embody other attributes beyond energy efficiency that are of value to homebuyers or that buyers are overpaying for the energy savings. Further research is needed to better understand how consumers interpret home certifications and how they value the combination of "green" characteristics that many of those certifications embody.

AU  - Sejas-Portillo, Rodolfo
AU  - Comerford, David
AU  - Moro, Mirko
AU  - Stowasser, Till
AB  - We study the effects of limited attention on property prices and energy efficiency (EE) investments in the housing market. Using a novel dataset, we analyse over 5 million residential property sale transactions in England and Wales, each containing information about sale price, property and location characteristics, and a mandatory energy performance certificate (EPC). The EPC includes a continuous energy cost rating (SAP rating) which is mapped into seven colour-coded rating bands (ranging from green A to red G). Applying a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), we document significant price discontinuities at the rating band thresholds. We estimate that--holding the underlying SAP score equal--being in a higher rating band increases the final sale price of a property between 0.8% and 2.5% ($2,000 and $6,625 based on average sale prices) depending on the threshold crossed. The presence of price discontinuities suggests that individuals are attentive to the simpler colour-coded rating band and partially inattentive to the more precise SAP rating. We present a simple model for estimating the degree of inattention and show that, for a given level of attention, rating bands reduce attention to the SAP rating by 25% on average. Importantly, the detected price discontinuities appear to influence market behaviour: Sellers whose property receives an EPC rating just below a threshold to the next-higher rating band are between 0.4% and 11% more likely to make last-minute EE investments before placing their property on the market. We discuss a number of recommendations of how to best leverage these threshold effects to improve policy design, which can be extended to other settings where the provision of simplified information creates reference thresholds.

TI  - Marketing Energy Productivity: Implications from the Commercial Real Estate Sector in Sweden.
AU  - Raggio, Randle D.
AU  - Ekman, Peter
AU  - Thompson, Steven
T2  - AMA Summer Educators' Conference Proceedings
AB  - Research Question Although energy consumption, conservation, and policy have emerged as significant social and governmental concerns, existing literature and recent interviews with commercial real estate firms and their tenants in Sweden and the U.S. reveal that--even among firms with a demonstrated concern for environmental issues--the primary driver of corporate action remains the bottom line. In the contest between "sustainability" and profit, profit always wins. While consumer attitudes have evolved, business still perceives goals of energy reduction to be at cross-purposes with financial performance. Is there a way to demonstrate the financial results of sustainability initiatives in a way that can demonstrate a positive impact on the bottom line? Instead of accepting the idea that firms must choose either profits or "sustainability," we ask whether reframing the concepts of "energy conservation" or "energy efficiency"-- which tend to be perceived as limited to energy reduction-- with the idea of energy productivity, conceptualized as output per unit of energy, will reveal a nexus of aligned interests that can bring industry, government, and society to the same side of the table. Method and Data We focus on energy use in the commercial real estate sector in Stockholm, Sweden. The starting-point for this study's data collection is the Green Fingerprint (GFP)--a software application ('app') that was developed by Mestro, a software development firm, in partnership with Humlegården Fastigheter AB (Humlegarden), a commercial real estate firm. The app allows commercial real estate tenants to see the real-time energy consumption of their leased space for electricity, heat, and cooling. Humlegarden is the leading commercial real estate firm in Sweden with respect to both its technology and brand positioning focused on sustainability. Humlegarden measures the energy use of 45 buildings housing approximately 1000 tenants via sensors on heating, cooling and electrical systems. Measurements are taken every 10-15 seconds, resulting in more than 7 million data points daily. We had access to over 50GB of GFP (operational, tenant) data collected by Humlegarden that covered pre- and post-Green Fingerprint implementation, and were in regular contact with representatives of these firms including tenant firms throughout the process as we collected data, developed our insights, and formulated our recommendations. Summary of Findings We demonstrate that attempts to improve energy conservation through existing measures such as Kilowatt-hours (kWh) per-square foot or kWh-per-employee, although easy to obtain, can be detrimental to the bottom line, as they may actually encourage wasteful practices. Further, they suffer quickly from diminishing returns, making them less influential over time. However, energy productivity, with even a simple operationalization of revenue per kWh, overcomes this problem and, like other useful metrics, focuses attention on the efficient use of resources under management control. Like existing productivity measures with which managers are familiar, such as revenue-per-employee, energy productivity is a concept that is both intuitive and attractive to those who wish to increase profits. At the same time, increasing energy productivity has environmental benefits. We demonstrate that tremendous brand and commercial value awaits the firm and/or industry that can effectively operationalize the concept of energy productivity and make it a part of its business model and brand positioning. Key Contributions This research makes three important contributions: (1) the application of the concept of energy productivity to corporate marketing, (2) a simple operationalization focused on managerial action, and (3) an empirical investigation with data from real firms. Our results suggest that while energy is consumed, monitored, and managed at the building level, relevant comparisons of results across organizations (e.g. , in the same industry) is critical. For example, guest-nights/kWh may be appropriate for hotels. Industry-level measures of energy productivity address the four issues identified in the extant research: (1) by treating energy as a controllable factor of production, it instills a cost focus on managers; (2) by providing a relevant metric across comparable firms, it provides relevant social norms, while (3) absolute and average industry values provide a benchmark against which all firms can compare themselves, providing a clear framework for goalsetting; and finally (4) measures of energy productivity can be reported on a monthly or quarterly basis aligned with other typical managerial reporting and do not suffer the same floor effects found with existing measures. Overall, we offer a clear demonstration of the possibilities for firms and government in order to provide a path forward for future policies, procedures and protocols. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

The report says the full economic impact of these changes will be substantial and will surely make the adoption of the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) much more given to arguing. The commercial real estate industry and product manufacturers are just some of the beneficiaries of the ICC decision.

TI  - Not so Myopic Consumers--Evidence on Capitalization of Energy Technologies in a Housing Market
AU  - Harjunen, Oskari
AU  - Liski, Matti
AB  - Policies affecting the cost of energy use provide correct incentives for technology choices only if there is a market reward for energy efficiency. We provide clean evidence for market efficiency by considering how heating technologies capitalize into house values using detailed Finnish register data on technologies in houses, transaction prices and socio-economic variables. We exploit variation in technologies that houses are locked into at construction time to identify the stand-alone value of having a cost-saving technology in the house. For the two main technologies, electric and district heating, the estimated price discount is 5-6% of the house value for electric heating, coming very close to the capitalized value of the cost differential obtained from external data on energy contract prices. Technologies act as "labels" with clear market valuation--the results support the idea that transparent energy-efficiency classification of houses capitalize into house prices.

AU  - Southworth, Jane

T2  - Journal of Building Survey, Appraisal & Valuation
AB  - Following a significant period of uncertainty the UK Government has confirmed the changes that will be made to the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC Scheme) in order to simplify it and reduce the administrative burdens it places on businesses. The CRC Scheme requires non-energy intensive organisations to measure and report on their energy consumption and purchase allowances for the amount of CO2 emissions associated with that consumption. The majority of the changes proposed will come into force from April 2014, however certain changes will come into effect from 1st June, 2013. Key changes for the real estate sector include the surprise abolition of the Performance League Table, the disapplication of the Landlord and Tenant Rule in respect of ground lease arrangements, and new rules in relation to CRC responsibility in Trust situations. The simplification of the CRC Scheme is to be welcomed as many businesses had struggled with its technical complexities, however, fundamental criticisms that the scheme is merely a tax remain. The Government will review the effectiveness of the simplified CRC Scheme in 2016. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - POLICY REVIEW.
AU  - HEALY, JOHN D.
T2  - Housing Studies
AB  - Energy-efficiency levels in housing vary considerably across Europe. Poor energy efficiency results in a number of social problems, including fuel poverty and ill health, as well as excess energy consumption which leads to high levels of energy-related environmental emissions; the policy context for these air pollutants is now well established. In light of these policy-drivers, this paper presents a cross-country analysis of housing conditions, energy-efficiency levels, affordability and satisfaction with housing in 14 European countries using longitudinal datasets from the European Community Household Panel for the years 1994-97. Very little empirical analysis of European housing conditions has been undertaken previously. The results indicate the existence of three main typologies in Europe as regards housing conditions, with serious housing deprivation in southern Europe, in terms of poor thermal efficiency, high fuel poverty, burdensome housing costs and low housing-satisfaction rates. In northern Europe, problems of damp and overcrowding are found, especially in the UK, Ireland, France and Belgium. The policy implications of these findings are outlined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Residential Energy Assistance: Effectiveness of Demonstration Program as Yet Undetermined: GAO-01-723.
AU  - Wells, Jim
AB  - Rising prices for natural gas, electricity, and other fuels have made it even harder for low-income families to pay their utility bills. By the end of fiscal year 2000, the Office of Community Services had awarded $30 million in Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH) program grants to 24 states and 12 tribal organizations to fund 54 separate projects to help meet the home energy (heating and cooling) needs of low-income households. These grants ranged from $50,000 to $1.6 million. Most of the 54 REACH projects have educated low-income clients about home energy efficiency through group workshops or on individual home visits. Many REACH projects have involved energy-related repairs to homes and budget counseling, and three state REACH projects are developing consumer cooperatives to purchase electricity or bulk fuels, such as heating oil. However, some REACH projects have included social services not directly related to meeting home energy needs. The legislation authorizing REACH identifies the following three performance goals for individual REACH projects,  (1) reduce the energy costs of participating households, (2) increase the regularity of home energy bill payments, and (3) increase energy suppliers' contributions to reduce eligible households' energy burden. Of the six project evaluations completed by states as of May 2001, only one project's design and implementation allowed statistically valid conclusions to be made about the effect of project services on participant energy use. The five other state project evaluations had analytical problems and other shortcomings that limited their usefulness in assessing project results. The Department of Health and Human Services has not yet developed a comprehensive plan for how it can best communicate summary information on best practices and lessons learned from the REACH program.

TI  - Residential Energy: Oversight of Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program Payments: GAO-05-1039.
AU  - Wells, Jim
T2  - GAO Reports
AB  - The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program with recent annual funding of about $2 billion that provides fuel payment assistance and payments for home energy efficiency improvements for low-income households. As energy prices continue to rise, this assistance is growing more important to mitigate the impact of higher prices on low-income households. HHS awards LIHEAP funds by formula to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, federally or state-recognized Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and territories. These grantees then provide energy assistance payments to low-income households. Within LIHEAP, the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH) program funds demonstration projects to help low-income families reduce their energy usage. GAO was asked to provide information on (1) HHS's oversight of LIHEAP payments made by grantees and (2) GAO's 2001 review of LIHEAP's REACH program. HHS relies on individual grantees--the states, tribal organizations, and territories--to oversee the LIHEAP program. Because the Single Audit Act made state and local governments primarily responsible for obtaining independent audits of funds they receive from federal programs, HHS's principal oversight function is to monitor, not audit, LIHEAP payments made by grantees. Monitoring includes assessing the quality of single audits conducted under the act, reviewing audit results, and ensuring that corrective actions are taken to resolve audit findings. GAO's brief review of relevant 2004 Single Audit Act reports showed that the only LIHEAP costs that were specifically questioned involved relatively small sums--for example, one report cited incorrect or duplicate payments totaling $8,864. Another audit report questioned $1,285 in LIHEAP payments because of inadequate procedures to prevent overpayments. GAO's 2001 review of the REACH program found several projects that included social services that were not directly related to meeting home energy needs. For example, six projects included job skill or employment development services, and one project provided funds to help clients pay past-due rent or mortgage payments. In addition, the report stated that REACH did not have performance goals that were objective and quantifiable. As a result, GAO did not believe HHS could effectively evaluate the program's overall performance. The report also noted that such goals would provide a clearer basis for selecting individual projects to fund. GAO recommended that HHS develop performance goals for REACH that were objective, measurable, and quantifiable. While HHS agreed with this recommendation, GAO has been unable to identify any actions taken to implement this recommendation. According to HHS, the agency continues to work on the development of long-term performance measures for LIHEAP. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We estimate that the recent surge in international fossil fuel prices will raise European households' cost of living in 2022 by close to 7 percent of consumption on average. Household burdens vary significantly across and within countries, but in most cases they are regressive. Policymakers have mostly responded to the shock with broad-based price-suppressing measures, including subsidies, tax reductions, and price controls. Going forward, the policy emphasis should shift rapidly towards allowing price signals to operate more freely and providing income relief to the vulnerable. The surge in energy prices will encourage energy conservation and investments in renewable energy, but the manyfold rise in natural gas prices could lead to a persistent switch towards coal. To ensure steady progress towards carbon emissions reduction goals, authorities could use the opportunity to strengthen carbon pricing when global fossil fuel prices decline in the future. Non-price incentives for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy should also be enhanced, as envisaged in the RePowerEU plan.

TI  - The Adverse Effect of Energy-Efficiency Policy
AU  - Voss, Achim
AB  - I analyze energy-efficiency policy as a prescription of a minimum-efficiency standard for energy-using household goods like cars, building insulation, and home appliances. Such a policy has two effects. At the intensive margin, a household that invests will choose a more efficient device. At the extensive margin, there will be more households that choose not to invest at all. Thus, additional to and different from rebound effects, energy-efficiency policy may have unintended consequences. I analyze the equilibrium effects of a minimum-efficiency standard, taking price adjustments and household heterogeneity into account. A moderate minimum-efficiency standard increases demand for efficiency-enhancing household capital goods, and reduces energy demand. More stringent policy is shown to be less effective or even counterproductive. For the case of a fixed supply of efficiency-enhancing capital, it is shown that minimum-efficiency standards increase equilibrium energy demand. Finally, I analyze which households benefit from minimum-efficiency standards and which ones lose. A standard induces investing households to expend more for household capital and less for energy. The wedge between the induced expenditures and the private optimum is analyzed as a deadweight loss.

AU  - Lambin, Xavier

AU  - Faure, Corinne
T2  - Energy Journal
AB  - We revisit the issue of the energy efficiency (EE) gap by explicitly acknowledging the two-sided nature of the rental housing market and two-sided asymmetries of information between tenants and landlords. Employing a theoretical matching model, we show that Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) that signal a dwelling's energy performance induce optimal EE investments by landlords only if tenants pay their energy expenditures in full. When landlords pay part of the energy expenditures, they seek tenants who will conserve energy. Our model shows that asymmetry of information over tenant characteristics results in suboptimally low investments in EE. This may even render EPCs counterproductive. As a remedy, we show that tenant-side signaling needs to be rolled out jointly with EPCs and may even be sufficient when contracts include energy expenditures. Data from an original survey provides support for these insights and suggests that information on the tenants' side contributes to more EE investment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T2  - Journal of Corporate Real Estate
AB  - Purpose On the basis of corporate wholesale and hypermarket stores, this study aims to investigate the relationship between energy consumption, physical building characteristics and operational sales performance and the impact of energy management on the corporate environmental performance.Design/methodology/approach A very unique dataset of METRO GROUP over 19 European countries is analyzed in a sophisticated econometric approach for the timeframe from January 2011 until December 2014. Multiple regression models are applied for the panel, to explain the electricity consumption of the corporate assets on a monthly basis and the total energy consumption on an annual basis. Using Generalized Additive Models, to model nonlinear covariate effects, the authors decompose the response variables into the implicit contribution of building characteristics, operational sales performance and energy management attributes, under control of the outdoor weather conditions and spatial–temporal effects.Findings METRO GROUP’s wholesale and hypermarket stores prove significant reductions in electricity and total energy consumption over the analyzed timeframe. Due to the implemented energy consumption and carbon emission reduction targets, the influence of the energy management measures, such as the identification of stores associated with the lowest energy performance, was found to contribute toward a more efficient corporate environmental performance.Originality/value In the context of corporate responsibility/sustainability of wholesale, hypermarket and retail corporations, the energy efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions from corporates’ real estate assets is of emerging interest. Besides the insights about the energy efficiency of corporate real estate assets, the role of the energy management, contributing to a more efficient corporate environmental performance, is not yet investigated for a large European wholesale and hypermarket portfolio.

T2  - European Economic Review
AB  - Abstract: In recent years, formal certification programs for rating and evaluating the sustainability and energy efficiency of buildings have proliferated around the world. Developers recognize that such “green labels” differentiate products and allow them to charge a price premium. China has not formally adopted such rating standards. In the absence of such standards, developers are competing with each other based on their own self-reported indicators of their buildings’ “greenness”. We create an index using Google search to rank housing complexes in Beijing with respect to their “marketing greenness” and document that these “green” units sell for a price premium at the presale stage but they subsequently resell or rent for a price discount. An introduction of a standardized official certification program would help “green” demanders to acquire units that they desire and would accelerate the advance of China’s nascent green real estate market.

TI  - THE "POWER" OF SOCIAL MEDIA: LEGAL ISSUES & BEST PRACTICES FOR UTILITIES ENGAGING SOCIAL MEDIA.
AU  - Elefant, Carolyn
T2  - Energy Law Journal
AB  - Once Web 2.0 luddites, more and more utilities are now adopting social media. Whether it's a company profile and job postings on LinkedIn, a Facebook page with tips about energy efficiency, or a Twitter stream disseminating information about recent outages, utilities are undeniably serious about adding digital real estate to their service territory. Yet even as the utility march towards Web 2.0 gathers momentum, the heavily regulated nature of the utility industry presents challenges in the naturally free-flowing world of social media. In addition to the traditional issues that all businesses face when engaging social media - from workplace concerns related to employee abuses of social media and appropriate discipline to copyright and IP protection - utilities must also ensure that their participation in social media does not run afoul of affiliate codes of conduct, SEC regulation, and a host of other compliance issues. This article provides an exhaustive summary of the legal and regulatory issues potentially implicated by utility engagement in social media, and proposes best practices and guidelines for development of a social media policy that reduce the risks of social media for utilities.

TI  - The price premium for green-labelled housing: Evidence from China.
AU  - Li Zhang
AU  - Hongyu Liu
AU  - Jing Wu
T2  - Urban Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.)
AB  - The Chinese central government introduced the 'Chinese Green Building Label' in 2008, which makes China one of the few developing countries with an official rating system of buildings' performance in sustainability. This paper investigates the existence and magnitude of the price premium associated with this official green label in the residential sector. Based on a unique data set of green-labelled, newly built housing projects and their non-labelled counterparts from around the country in 2013, an empirical analysis suggests that the labelled housing projects attract a price premium of 6.9% compared with their non-labelled counterparts. Further analysis suggests that this official green label is more effective as a reliable signal of buildings' energy efficiency in the Chinese context compared with developers' self-advertised 'greenness'. These results provide preliminary evidence that with this official rating system, the investment in buildings' energy-efficiency could be potentially profitable for housing developers in China, and such profitability may herald a rapid development of the green housing market in urban China.

AU  - Costa, Joana

T2  - International Conference on Applied Business & Management (ICABM2022)
AB  - Worldwide, policy makers have on top of their agendas to mitigate climate emergency. Green buildings are no longer a niche market, being increasingly adopted due to their enlarged benefits, in both environmental and economic terms. Sustainable and ecofriendly architecture is the natural path for the housing sector to achieve balance and contribute to the overall sustainable development. For this reason, moving towards greener buildings must be immediate in a world relying upon scant earth extracted resources. Sustainable buildings produce environmental, social and economic benefits, as such, their patterns should be the norm instead of the exception. Shifting towards greener buildings is attractive to all players in the innovation ecosystem; as, these properties generate value for their owners, their users, and to the entire society. Indeed, several rating systems exist to assess the environmental performance of real estate, ranking their sustainability performance in terms of energy consumption. Energy performance certificates are among the most popular in Portugal. These certificates identify the property energy efficiency highlighting the strengths and the weaknesses in each component. Among the UE countries, EPCs were introduced by the Directive (2010/31/EU) in 2010, albeit with heterogeneous paces and slightly singular details in each member states. Being for consequence the core EU policy instrument to improve energetic performance of buildings to reach energetic sustainability. The empirical analysis relies on the evolution of the Portuguese certificate emissions in the time frame of 2014-2020 at the municipality level, proving that the greener transition in buildings has been asymmetrically addressed in the geography, further highlighting the asymmetries between seaside and countryside, and also big and small cities. Planning and building cities, disregarding their size, is critical for developing competitive and livable cities in which one may find energetic justice due to the smart use of energy sources allowing the entire community to access modern standards of living. However, this analysis has not been made so far, being neglected in extant literature. In doing so, we aim to shed light on the efficacy of the policy instrument as a seed of sustainable practices, but also on the promotion of territorial cohesion, which is a particularly hard problem to tackle by policy makers given the demographic and economic challenges of the present.

AB  - The residential sector is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions. Improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock can reduce carbon emissions and increase property values. In this paper, we examine whether residential energy efficiency improvements are capitalized into home prices in Anchorage, Alaska. The impact of a residential energy efficiency program on single-family house prices is estimated using both a hedonic pricing framework and a difference-in-differences estimator. The results indicate that participating homes sell for a premium of 4.2% compared to similar properties that did not participate in the program.

AB  - This research explores the time-to-sell (TTS) of green real estate. We employ data on primary market transactions in six newly developed multi-story condominiums--of which three are green and three are conventionally built--located in a single neighborhood of Netanya, Israel. We find that, after addressing the potential endogeneity between unit TTS and price, the average TTS of units in green, as compared to conventional, structures is significantly shorter. Considering developers' financing cost, this shorter TTS is equivalent to an indirect price premium of 1%-5%. We also find that whenever the indirect green premium associated with TTS decreases, the green quality-adjusted price premium increases. Thus, considering both price and TTS, we estimate a total green price premium of about 5%.

AU  - van der Maaten, Emiel
T2  - Journal of Sustainable Real Estate
AB  - Real option value can severely hinder investments in energy conservation in real estate. This paper evaluates whether policy incentives to invest now, instead of tomorrow can be tailored to compensate for any option value to defer. A case study reviews a Dutch government subsidy program with the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) binomial method. Based on market priced risk, the subsidy properly compensates investors for the real option value they forgo by exercising the option and investing in a solar hot water system. A survey amongst homeowners reveals that private risks are an important part of the perceived uncertainty when investing in energy efficiency and should be included in the model. A practitioners' method is proposed that uses a binomial real option model to design policy incentives and surveys to assess the relevant uncertainties to include in the model. The results displayed in strategy spaces makes intuitive decisions possible.

TI  - Using Equity Capital to Unlock Investment in Building Energy Efficiency?
AU  - Michelsen, Claus

AU  - Schopp, Anne
T2  - DIW Economic Bulletin
AB  - The energy transition will require considerable increases in energy efficiency, particularly in residential buildings. Financial support mechanisms, information and advice programs and dedicated training and certification of craftsmen are already in place to stimulate energy efficiency investment. Nevertheless, the required annual rate of thermal building refurbishment of around two percent is so far not achieved. For some real estate owners this may be explained by a investment horizon that is shorter than lifetime and repayment period of energy efficiency investment projects. The reluctance may also be due to an inadequate risk assessment by investors. Alternative financing approaches that rely mainly on the principle of coupling the revenues of the investment to actual energy cost savings and the increased involvement of equity capital might in such instances contribute to increasing investment activity. Particularly, in the current phase of low interest rates, there is more investment pressure on institutional investors whose willingness to participate in energy efficiency projects is likely to have increased substantially. Experience in other countries has however moderated expectations of being able to trigger greater short-term stimuli with innovative financial instruments. Nevertheless, given the challenges of the energy transition, further investigation of innovative financial concepts also based on equity funding seems warranted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
