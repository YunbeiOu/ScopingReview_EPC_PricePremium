TI  - Does Energy Star Certification Reduce Energy Use in Commercial Buildings?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
AB  - A number of policies and programs are aimed at reducing energy use in buildings-building energy codes, disclosure laws, energy-use benchmarking, and mandated or subsidized energy audits. In the United States, many of these initiatives are enacted at the state or local level. At the federal level, one of the main programs is Energy Star certification, which provides a label to top energy-performing buildings. In this paper, we evaluate changes in rents and utility expenditures following Energy Star certification using a national sample of over 4,100 office buildings combined with Energy Star data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We find that building rents increase by 3.6% following certification, but that utility expenditures remain unchanged. We provide novel evidence that buildings do not make upgrades or capital investments to obtain a certification, suggesting that the Energy Star program primarily certifies buildings that are already energy efficient.

TI  - Sustainability Messages in Residential Property Advertising
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Companies and brands are increasingly addressing issues of sustainability in their marketing and advertising as they respond to consumers' evolving interests and preferences. While studies have examined the presence of sustainability messages in advertising in general, and in a number of discrete industries, the use of these messages in residential property advertising is critically understudied. Some homebuyers, however, appear interested in these messages, as evidence suggests they ascribe value to certain sustainability claims and features. An analysis of the textual and visual content of 100 property adverts for city centre flats, listed for sale in two English cities in early 2022, afforded detailed insights into the positioning of sustainability in residential real estate advertising. Findings from this analysis indicate that explicit sustainability messages are rare. Property and locational features related to environmental sustainability are mentioned more frequently than those related to social sustainability. Features related to economic sustainability are discussed in adverts targeted at property investors. Sparse explicit discussion of sustainability in adverts might imply that there is little general concern for this issue, either amongst those selling property and/or amongst those buying property. An implication of this might be that pro-sustainability measures targeted at the housing sector may encounter a muted response from actors within the sector, potentially frustrating the implementation of those measures. For homebuyers who are interested in a property's sustainability, the findings suggest that they are poorly served by current practices in property advertising. Estate agents and developers wishing to appeal to these sustainability-minded consumers might do well to incorporate greater commentary on a property's sustainability features in their advertising materials.

TI  - Identifying Market Segment for the Assessment of a Price Premium for Green Certified Housing: A Cluster Analysis Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - While the literature confirms the existence of a green premium, various researchers have acknowledged the importance of homogeneity in the dataset used for premium assessment. This study developed a systematic approach to extract a sales subsample containing transactions from green-certified apartments and their most similar counterparts based on cluster analysis. The study applied k-means and PAM clustering algorithms to split an extensive sales sample of 81,605 transactions into sales subsamples. A sales subsample containing transactions from green-certified apartments and their peers was extracted and used for green premium estimation. The results indicate that through cluster analysis, a market segment containing above 80% of the total housing transactions from green-certified apartments could be identified. Through the hedonic model, a green premium of 26.2% was identified from the entire sales sample (no market segmentation). However, this value was reduced to 12.2 and 17.8% when estimated from a sales subsample extracted through k-means and PAM clustering, respectively. These findings have implications for the close assessment of green certification impact on the sale prices. In addition, they can also serve as an indicator of housing categories that need extra effort to promote green practices in that particular market segment.

TI  - Qualitative/Quantitative Comparison of Changes in Alanya Rural Architecture in terms of CO2 Emissions and Energy Conservation within the Scope of Sustainability
T2  - ICONARP INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING
AB  - Due to the rapid growth and development caused mainly by tourism of Alanya, rural areas are affected, losing their original texture and authentic structures and being exposed to unqualified interventions. The aim of this study is to determine the original features and reveal the value of Alanya rural architecture within the framework of the sustainability principles, and to determine how these values have changed with the unqualified interventions, by detailing qualitatively and quantitatively on the basis of each intervention. Within the scope of the study, the rural architectural heritage in Alanya has been documented in terms of settlement texture, space organization, architectural elements, material, construction and energy efficiency. For the analysis, a rural house that preserves its original values was used. A comparison was made between the values of this house and the values obtained as a result of the changes in the other buildings in the area. In cases where these interventions are applied in various variations, the changes in the heating and cooling load of the house are compared with the CO2 emission. It has been determined that the rural houses of Alanya provide energy conservation in a way that is perfected by tradition, both in terms of settlement features and space and materials on the basis of structure. It has been determined that the heating/cooling energy requirement can decrease but the CO2 emission increases in the individual changes made by evaluating different types of deterioration. When the most common application variations detected in the field are evaluated, it has been determined that both the heating/cooling energy requirement and the CO2 emission have increased. Rural settlements and residences define an architecture that has reached the highest level in terms of convenience, functionality and economy. Since any intervention to these structures means the loss of their energy conservation properties as well as their originality, a very careful decision should be made. The study reveals the first data in which the rural architecture of Alanya is evaluated within the scope of sustainability and energy and CO2 emissions are compared depending on deterioration/changes.

TI  - Assessing evidence for inattention to the costs of homeownership
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS
AB  - Many goods and services have accompanying costs that are not salient at the moment of purchase. Existing research suggests that consumers are inattentive to such costs when making small purchases. There is less evidence about attention to costs associated with large purchases. This paper examines residential real estate transactions and studies the extent to which sale prices adjust to ownership costs. The results are inconclusive, neither ruling out full price adjustment nor lack of price adjustment. Despite the inconclusive result, the inability to decisively rule out incomplete price adjustment to predictable ownership costs (which is suggestive of inattention) is noteworthy, given the high financial stakes of buying a home.

TI  - Are Cave Houses a Sustainable Real Estate Alternative?
T2  - LAND
AB  - The high level of energy consumption of buildings has outlined the need for more sustainable and environmentally friendly constructions, which has led to cave houses now being more highly valued. This study looks to study whether sustainable constructions, such as cave houses, have an economic impact with regard to other construction types in the real estate market in Granada. Moreover, this study looks to determine whether energy rating is a relevant characteristic for the price of cave houses and whether the price determinants vary according to whether the house in question is a cave house or a single-family one. To develop this study, a final sample of 61,573 properties was used. A regression model estimated by ordinary least squares was performed. This study shows that cave houses are being marketed at higher prices than single-family houses. It was noted that energy rating is not an important characteristic for estimating the price of a cave house. Finally, in this type of housing, refrigeration equipment is not one of the determining characteristics for the price.

TI  - Cold homes and mental health harm: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
AB  - Cold homes are associated with a range of serious health conditions as well as excess winter mortality. Despite a comparatively mild climate cold homes are a significant problem in the UK, with a recent estimate finding that over one-quarter of low-income households had been unable to adequately heat their home in winter 2022. The magnitude of cold housing in a country that benefits from a mild climate indicates indifference towards, or acceptance of, a significant minority of people living in inadequate conditions on the part of policy makers. Cold homes are therefore a source of social harm. Recent changes to the household energy price cap, the rising cost of living, the ongoing effects of the benefit cap, and below inflation uprating to social security benefits is likely to greatly exacerbate this issue. In this research we use data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study to explore whether living in a cold home causes mental health harm. We control for mental distress and housing temper-ature on entry to the survey in order to account for the potentially bi-directional relationship. Multilevel discrete -time event history models show that the transition into living in a home that is not suitably warm is associated with nearly double the odds of experiencing severe mental distress for those who had no mental distress at the beginning of the survey; and over three times the odds of severe mental distress for those previously on the borderline of severe mental distress. These results show the significant costs of failing to ensure that people are able to live in homes in which they are able to live comfortably by even the most basic standards. These costs will be felt not just individually, but also more broadly in terms of increased health spending and reduced working.

TI  - Swedish public and private housing companies' access to the capital market for financing energy renovation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The financing of energy efficiency measures and renovations is key to reaching energy efficiency targets for the housing sector. The purpose of this article is to add the Swedish case of how capital market funds have become accessible and used by public and private housing companies, in particular for energy efficiency measures. The core of this article are interviews with representatives of Swedish housing companies made during the spring of 2021 with the purpose of mapping how public and larger private housing companies finance renovation and energy efficiency measures, and to what extent funds from the capital market are used for these purposes. In this article, we have found that capital market funds are commonly used by the Swedish public and the largest private housing companies. Bonds are less costly compared to bank loans, and green bonds are 0.02-0.03 percentage points less costly than conventional bonds. Furthermore, control systems that investigate the values of building portfolios as security for bonds are poor. A conclusion is that governmental control systems over the capital market issuing bonds for the housing market could be needed to avert future housing bubbles.

TI  - The Rising Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War: Energy Transition, Climate Justice, Global Inequality, and Supply Chain Disruption
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
AB  - This perspective paper explores the rising impacts of the COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war from different perspectives, with an emphasis on the role of climate financing in achieving equitable and just transition mechanisms and that of peace in expediting this pursuit and sustaining this drive. It is motivated by the realization that there is an urgent need for accelerating the decarbonisation agenda, as highlighted in pre-COP26 debates and in the resulting Glasgow Climate Pact, through the mitigation measures that can be unpacked at both cost and scale. This is further reiterated in the third instalment of Assessment Report 6 (AR6) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, dwelling on Mitigation of Climate Change, underlining the required policy shifts and technology developmental needs. Green technology, however, comes at a green premium, being more expensive to implement in geographies that cannot absorb its cost in the immediate short term. This engenders an inequitable and unjust landscape, as those that require green technology are unable to have access to it but are most often on the frontlines of the impacts of climate change. While it is urgent to review this issue and to encourage more cooperation for technology development and transfer, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war are posing mounting challenges for achieving these objectives. These two crises are causing an unprecedented rise in commodities and labour pricing, with further knock-on impacts on global supply chains for technology. This is in turn rendering green technology unattainable for developing and less developed countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

TI  - The Process of Digitalization of the Urban Environment for the Development of Sustainable and Circular Cities: A Case Study of Bologna, Italy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The residential heritage that was built during the great expansion of real estate after the Second World War has severe deficiencies in structural safety, fire resistance, energy efficiency, and accessibility and these cannot be solved with sustainable renovation measures. This study focuses on replacement interventions and promotes a management model that addresses three areas (technical, social, and economic) and it refers to the application of the circularity principle to the construction sector for the goal of climate neutrality by 2050. The final objective is to define a protocol-namely, the guidelines-to reference in a decision-making process that promotes urban regeneration by comparing demolition with reconstruction and renovation. The proposed methodology allows for the determination of suitable areas in Bologna for replacement and the joining of the municipal geodatabase with data from archival research on building permits in 1949-1965 by using GIS software. This digital archive can be implemented in a digital twin for an urban block, which can become a predictive tool for urban planning and the management of the whole life of a building. The main result is the characterization of urban blocks by identifying typical features belonging to specific building libraries that are validated with density analyses. These urban clusters and building archetypes can be used to assess targeted intervention measures by using specific tools, such as predictive maps and 3D city models.

TI  - Evidence for residential building retrofitting practices using explainable AI and socio-demographic data
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
AB  - Extensive retrofits and effective policy measures are needed to meet the ambitious climate goals, particularly in the UK, with the EU's oldest residential building stock. Researchers must investigate the factors influencing retrofits to enable effective and targeted policy measures. To date, however, there is a lack of holistically large-scale quantitative studies accounting for such factors. At the same time, great potential is seen in data-driven solutions and the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). We address this research gap by combining supervised machine learning with XAI employing a three -stage approach: First, we consolidate datasets of Energy Performance Certificates from England and Wales from which we extract conducted retrofits, house prices, and socio-demographic information. Second, we apply an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that predicts whether a building has been retrofitted or not. Lastly, we use SHapley Additive exPlanations values (SHAP) as an XAI technique to identify the key factors and relationships that influence the implementation of retrofits. We succeed in substantiating results previously obtained in qualitative or small-scale studies and also find that retrofit-related policies already implemented in regional cases, such as the "Better Homes for Yorkshire"initiative, can successfully achieve large-scale success through replication in other regions. Further, our results suggest the implementation of income-based CO2 taxes as a reasonable and easy-to-implement policy measure. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Energy efficiency improves energy access affordability
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Energy efficiency can make energy access more affordable by reducing the electricity cost burden on households and businesses. Improving products' energy efficiency helps reduce monthly energy bills- freeing up funds that can feed back into the economy, thus stimulating economic growth. To demonstrate these benefits, this paper conducts a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and a national impact analysis (NIA) for implementing an energy -efficiency standards and labeling (EESL) program for refrigeration products in Uganda. The CBA compares the costs versus the benefits of investing in energy-efficient products for consumers: It shows that the most cost-effective products have an efficiency level 35 % higher than baseline products sold on the market. By choosing these products, consumers save, on average, US$76 over the lifetime of the product. The NIA assesses the impact of an energy-efficiency standard set at that level and shows potential cumulative savings of US$595 million (2023-2040) for households and small businesses. These savings translate into additional purchasing power for households and investments for small businesses, leading to increased living standards and economic devel-opment. This paper describes the importance of implementing energy efficiency policies and programs in emerg-ing economies where affordability of electricity hinders electricity access. This paper provides a rigorous approach of using CBA and NIA assessments to demonstrate the economic savings for the consumers and the na-tion to implement EESL programs for major electric equipment.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of International Energy Initiative.

TI  - Electric Kettles: An Assessment of Energy-Saving Potentials for Policy Making in the European Union
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Electric kettles are found in almost every household in the European Union. Within the preparatory study to establish the Ecodesign Working Plan 2015-2017, the electricity consumption of this product group in Europe was estimated at 20 to 33 TWh in 2012, with an energy-saving potential of more than 20%. This led to an Ecodesign preparatory study on kettles in 2020 to analyse the potential role of environmental policy-making for electric kettles in Europe in more detail. Based on elements from this study, this paper reviews worldwide policies covering this product group, methods to assess its energy efficiency and analyses of the potential of technical improvements to enhance energy efficiency. A method is suggested for measuring the power of kettles, and corresponding power-temperature measurements of selected kettles are presented. Overall, the findings indicate that technical optimization alone has a limited potential to improve the energy efficiency of kettles and to highlight the absence of a standard for measuring the energy consumption of electric kettles. However, user-related aspects of operating kettles offer a substantial saving potential. Heating too much water or at higher than required temperatures increase the energy consumption and related energy costs of private households. This could provide leverage for policy makers to improve the market and to reduce the environmental impact of this product group beyond mere technical optimization of energy efficiency, including aspects related to circular economy and energy sufficiency.

TI  - Energy Performance Certificate Classes Rating Methods Tested with Data: How Does the Application of Minimum Energy Performance Standards to Worst-Performing Buildings Affect Renovation Rates, Costs, Emissions, Energy Consumption?
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Energy renovations of the building stock are a paramount objective of the European Union (EU) to combat climate change. A tool for renovation progress monitoring is energy performance certificate (EPC) labelling. The present study tested the effect of different EPC label classifications on a national database, which comprises similar to 25,000 EPC values from apartment buildings, detached houses, office buildings, and educational, commercial, and service buildings. Analysing the EPC classes labelling resulting from four different EU methods, we estimated the annual renovation rates, costs, energy savings, and CO2 emissions reduction that would affect the national building stock if each of them was adopted, to fulfil the European Climate Target Plan by the year 2033. The ISO 52003-1:2017 two-point and one-point methods determined a very uneven distribution of renovation rates, from 0.45% to similar to 9%. Conversely, the Directive 15% recently proposed in COM/2021/802 with uniform rates determined smaller differences and standard deviation, not pushing renovations above 3.70%, namely a rate that once fine-tuned can stimulate realistic, yet effective renovation campaigns. The major differences in renovation rates provided by the studied methods show the need for a harmonized strategy such as the Directive proposal to enable achievement of European targets.

TI  - Time-adjusted transaction costs for energy renovations for single-family house-owners
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - This study empirically estimated disaggregate market transaction costs facing single-family house-owners when energy renovating their dwelling. Two types of energy renovations are analysed: heat insulation and energy -saving windows. An analytical framework was developed including an adjustment mechanism for time-biases displayed by households. The decision process was modelling in three steps where households can be either latent, potential or actual clients to an energy renovation project. Data was collected by web-based surveys. The transaction costs are estimated based on time assessment, income levels and monetary expenditures occurring in the decision process. The results suggest that the magnitude of the transaction costs can be an important barrier to energy renovations. For energy-saving windows, transaction costs can constitute more than 50% of the in-vestment cost, and almost 24% for heat insulation. The largest potential reduction in the transaction costs is found in the implementation phase.

TI  - Courtyard design impact on indoor thermal comfort and utility costs for residential households: Comparative analysis and deep-learning predictive model
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - A courtyard is an architectural design element which is often known as microcli-mate modifiers and is responsible to increase the indoor occupant comfort in traditional archi-tecture. The aim of this study is to conduct a parametric evaluation of courtyard design variants in a residential building of different climates with a focus on indoor thermal comfort and utility costs. A brute-force approach is applied to generate a wide range of design alter-natives and the simulation workflow is conducted by Grasshopper together with the environ-mental plugins Ladybug and Honeybee. The main study objective is the evaluation of the occupant thermal comfort in an air-conditioned residential building, energy load, and cost analysis, derived from different design variables including courtyard geometry, window-to -wall ratio, envelope materials, heating, and cooling set-point dead-bands, and building geographical location. Furthermore, a Deep Learning model is developed using the inputs and outputs of the simulation and analysis to transform the outcomes into the algorithmic and tangible environment feasible for predictive applications. The results suggest that regarding the thermal loads, costs, and indoor thermal comfort index (PMV), there are high correlations between the outdoor weather variation and dead-band ranges, while in extreme climates such as Singapore, courtyard spaces might not be efficient enough as expected. Finally, the highly accurate deep learning model is also developed, delivering superior predic-tive capabilities for the thermal comfort and utility costs of the courtyard designs.(c) 2022 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

TI  - Regulatory barriers to implementing sustainable buildings in Kosovo
T2  - PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight the regulatory barriers to achieving sustainable buildings in Kosovo. The present paper focuses on regulatory barriers viewed from the perspective of construction industry experts in achieving sustainable buildings. Design/methodology/approach The present study uses a qualitative research method and semi-structured interviews as a research instrument. The present study interviews around 20 experts in construction and property management, property development, spatial planning and energy management. Findings The study finds that Kosovo building laws and regulations provide for the materials assessment criteria, but the materials assessment criteria are only for mechanic strength. The study further finds that the sustainability concept is not included and incorporated in Kosovo's urban planning laws and regulations. The study also finds that despite specific clauses mentioning energy performance certificates in the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings in Kosovo, energy performance certificates appears to be not enforced and the nature of the barrier is more organizational rather than regulatory. Finally, the study finds that Kosovo laws are silent as far as green labeling of building materials is concerned. Practical implications The implication of the present finding is that policymakers in Kosovo not only should include clear sustainable materials assessment criteria in the law, but also enforce those criteria through testing and inspection mechanisms included in the law and implemented in practice through funding and organizational support. Nonetheless, policymakers in Kosovo should contemplate amending the urban planning laws in Kosovo and include both the term of sustainability at the planning level and conformity guidelines for sustainable design that can be done at the administrative directive level. Further, the clauses in the law do not suffice if the clauses are not accompanied by specific systemic and organizational support in the issuance of energy performance certificates. Policymakers in Kosovo should be proactive in designing clauses that specify green labeling standards for materials; however, these labeling standards should not adversely affect the cost of construction and reduce the demand for real estate. Originality/value The study is the first qualitative study about the perception of construction professionals in Kosovo, regarding the regulatory barriers of sustainable buildings in Kosovo.

This study investigates the price premiums of green buildings in Taipei City, the largest metropolis in Taiwan, to examine how they have changed over time, and assesses the magnitude of the capitalization effects under varying housing price levels. The empirical results indicate that Taipei residents are willing to pay higher prices for houses with green-label certification. The higher the certification level, the higher the price that residents are willing to pay. This study additionally identifies two characteristics of the capitalization effects in this market. The first is that the price premiums vary with the market condition. For example, during housing market downturns (e.g., 2014-2015), building green premiums may be unremarkable or non-existent. The second effect identified is that green buildings tend to exhibit an 'aristocratic trend.' This means that high-priced houses (i.e., houses priced above the 80% quantile) in the high-end label category attract the highest premiums, implying that the willingness to pay for green features tends to only exist among wealthy buyers. The result of this paper provides evidence to explain the heterogeneity of green build premiums. Regarding the specificity of these premiums, this paper provides recommendations for builders and managers.

TI  - Investigating the Energy-Efficient Structures Using Building Energy Performance Simulations: A Case Study
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - The use of energy efficient structures in the local construction industry assists in promoting green building concepts, leading to economical and eco-friendly solutions for self-sustained structures. The main aim of this study was to examine and compare the energy performance of various local buildings. Detailed 3D building models (house, office, and warehouse buildings) were constructed and investigated for their cost and energy savings using building energy simulation tools (green building studio and insight). Moreover, the effects of various building materials for walls, window panels, and roof construction were explored, and a life-cycle cost analysis was performed. It was observed that the effect of the window-to-wall ratio was less severe in term of energy use in office buildings compared to normal houses due to the larger amount of space available for air circulation. Furthermore, the most efficient location for windows was found to be at the middle of the wall in comparison with the top and bottom positions. The effect of the orientation mainly depended on the symmetry of the building. More symmetric buildings, i.e., tested warehouse buildings (rectangular structure), showed an energy use difference of around 7 MJ/m(2)/year for a 360 degrees orientation change. Tested house buildings exhibited an energy use difference of up to 25 MJ/m(2)/year. Three-pane glass windows also showed major improvements, and the total energy consumption for houses was reduced to 14%. Furthermore, wood walls showed comparable energy performance with brick walls without the use of insulation. According to US-LEED guidelines, the tested house, office, and warehouse buildings achieved 79, 89, and 88 points, respectively. The cost recovery period for house, office, and warehouse buildings was estimated to 54, 13, and 14 years, respectively, including running and maintenance costs. It can be argued that the Insight and Green Building Studio packages can assist construction stakeholders to determine the energy efficiency of the modeled building as well as to help in the selection of materials for optimized and improved design.

TI  - Heterogeneous Effect of "Eco-Friendly" Dwellings on Transaction Prices in Real Estate Market in Portugal
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - The main objective of this research is to assess the impact of energy certificate ratings (EPCs) on the value per m(2) of Portuguese housing sales. Data from 289 Portuguese municipalities between 2014 and 2019, analysed with a fixed effects panel and method of moments quantile regression, were used. EPCs with high energy efficiency ratings (e.g., A+, A, B, and B-) are used as a proxy for dwellings with "green" or "environmentally friendly" certificates. On the other hand, ratings with a low energy efficiency (e.g., C, D, E, and F) are used as a proxy for dwellings with "non-green" or "not environmentally friendly" certificates. The results support that EPCs associated with green housing increase the value per m(2) of housing sales, and those associated with non-green housing decrease the sales value. It was also found that municipal GDP, tax/financial incentive policies for energy efficiency, and the number of completed dwellings in new constructions for family housing will increase sales value. On the other hand, credit agreements and completed reconstructions reduce sales value. Lastly, the results and outgrowths of this study will support the policymakers and governments in developing consistent policies and initiatives that promote the "green" or "eco-friendly" dwellings in Portugal or in similar economies.

TI  - Energy efficiency at what cost? Unjust burden-sharing of rent increases in extensive energy retrofitting projects in Sweden
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Although renovation costs can lead to rent increases in energy retrofitting, it is often assumed that reductions in energy costs will counterbalance the rent increase. In Swedish multifamily housing, energy costs for heating are however generally included as a fixed component in the monthly rent, meaning that the rent increase after energy retrofitting corresponds to the net change in rent level as well as energy costs for heating. This makes Sweden a methodologically advantageous setting for studying tenants' cost burden of energy retrofitting. The aim of this study was thus to investigate how energy performance improvement has affected rent increases in Swedish renovation projects between 2013 and 2019. Utilising a national database of multifamily housing, it was found that energy retrofitting entailed a cost relief for tenants in renovation projects with smaller investments. However, in renovation projects with larger investments, energy retrofitting entailed a cost burden for tenants. Moreover, public housing companies had conducted a high share of the extensive energy retrofits, leading to low-income tenant groups being dispropor-tionately subjected to cost burdens of energy retrofitting. On the contrary, light energy retrofits with a cost relief for energy efficiency had been rather evenly distributed across income groups. These results indicate ongoing conflicts with the ability-to-pay principle in the energy transition of Swedish multifamily housing, and suggest that if low-investment energy retrofits are not sufficient for upcoming objectives and requirements, subsidies could be needed to compensate low-income tenants for the cost burden of extensive energy retrofitting.

TI  - The influence of housing location on energy ratings price premium in Alicante, Spain
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Location is, along with other aspects, one of the most important characteristics when determining the sale or rental price of a residential property. Energy rating is one of the characteristics involved in determining the rent or sale price of a house. Past research has shown the importance of this attribute in numerous studies. Moreover, these studies have found mixed results regarding the magnitude, direction, and statistical significance of energy rating price premiums. This research aims to determine whether housing location influences energy rating price premium. To achieve this objective, a least squares regression model and a multilevel model were estimated using a sample of 70,170 different residences that were offered for sale in the province of Alicante. The multilevel models show that, once the differences due to the location (comarca) had been eliminated, the energy rating label itself had an effect on the asking price and also that there was an effect for the relationship of the energy rating with the location characteristics (comarca). On the other hand, the variables that defined the energy ratings were not those responsible for the differences between the average asking prices of the residences in the comarcas.

TI  - The value of energy efficiency in residential buildings - a matter of heterogeneity?!
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Energy efficiency ratings of residential buildings are intended to remove assessment errors from real estate markets to increase energy efficiency - the key to fully decarbonizing the building sector. Price premiums of rated buildings should reflect capitalized future energy savings, but instead are nonlinear (1), can exceed savings (2) and are correlated with buyer's characteristics (3). We explore these anomalies with a hedonic model of product differentiation, which is adapted to efficiency valuation in the housing market. The model implies that buyers with high willingness to pay for efficiency "sort" themselves to efficient buildings (and vice versa) and drive their premiums above average discounted energy expenditures - if the market share of the efficient buildings is below average. In this sense a non-linear scarcity premium explains findings (1) and (2). Furthermore, it is revealed that the results from (3) require average buyer's characteristics to vary spatially, but neither their variance nor the variance of buildings stocks efficiency - strong assumptions. The model explains measured premiums of the UK well and shows that as well as buyer heterogeneity and supply structure, the prebound effect - the overestimation of energy costs in inefficient buildings by ratings - also plays an important role in determining efficiency premiums.

TI  - An empirical study on measuring operating efficiency and revenue of real estate assets in the UAE using data envelopment analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF FACILITIES MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the performance efficiency of 56 real estate assets within the rental sector in the UAE to evaluate the relative operation efficiency in relation to revenue generation. Design/methodology/approach The data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach was used to measure the relative operational efficiency of the studied assets in relation to the revenue performance. This method could produce a more informed and balanced approach to performance measurement. Findings The outcomes show that scores of efficiencies ranging from 7% to 99% in some of the models. The results showed that on average buildings are 75% relatively less efficient in maintenance, in term of revenue generation, than the benchmark set. Likewise, on average, the inefficient buildings are 60% relatively less efficient in insurance. Result also shows that 95% of the building assets in the sample are by and large operating at decreasing returns to scale. This implies that managers need to considerably reduce the operational resources (input) to improve the levels of revenue. Research limitations/implications This study recommends that the FM operational variables that were found to inefficiently contribute to the revenue should be re-examined to test the validity of the findings. This is necessary before generalising or interpolating the results that are presented in this study. Practical implications The information obtained about operational performance can help FM managers to understand which improvements in the productivity of inefficient FM resources are required, providing insight into how to reduce operating costs and increase revenue. Originality/value This paper adds value in using new FM operational parameters to evaluate the efficiency of the performance of built assets.

TI  - Investigating the drivers and acceptance of sustainable materials in Kuwait: A case study of CEB
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS
AB  - Sustainable practices in construction industry are still facing numerous challenges despite the continuous efforts and campaigns for sustainable construction worldwide. This study aims to investigate the drivers of sustainable construction in the Kuwaiti construction industry with focus on Compressed Earth Blocks (CEBs) as an alternative sustainable construction material. It also aims to explore the level of awareness and acceptance of sustainable construction material among different stakeholders. The research was organized in three phases. The first phase identified the main drivers from relevant literature and similar studies in the past. In the second phase, a questionnaire-based survey was designed and implemented based on the findings from the literature. Two different questionnaires were designed for the survey: the first one was dedicated for stakeholders with limited knowledge about technical aspects of construction industry (owners, clients, real estate companies) and the second one was dedicated for practitioners and specialists (construction companies, engineers, project managers). In the third phase, statistical analyses were performed to compare the influence of the drivers on the stakeholders' choices. Friedman test and Bonferroni-Dunn test were used to statistically demonstrate the level of importance of the investigated drivers. The results showed that the most influencing drivers in the choice of sus-tainable materials from the practitioners' perspective are "Energy Efficiency", "Availability and Accessibility to Resources", "Environmental Impact", "Enhancement of Health and Safety" and "Knowledge and Skill of Personnel" with no significant difference, followed by the "Client De-mands" and the "Cost Savings" then finally the "Awareness on Sustainability". It was also concluded that the clients' perspective ranked the "Cost Saving" and the "Enhancement of Health and Safety" as the most important drivers followed by the "Availability and Accessibility to Re-sources" and the "Environmental Impact". The survey also showed that despite the poor level of awareness on environmental sustainability, the results related to the level of acceptance of sus-tainable construction materials are optimistic. This observation demonstrates the readiness/ willingness of clients and practitioners to shift towards sustainable construction materials, but the lack of knowledge and awareness can be the most challenging barrier to more sustainable practices. Hence, it is believed that strategies for promoting sustainability in construction in-dustry should start by spreading knowledge among all involved stakeholders.

TI  - Prioritizing Green Building Attributes on Conventional Office Building Rental Depreciation Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - This paper explores the green building attributes that significantly influenced rental depreciation for conventional buildings from expert perspectives using Malaysia as a case study. The objectives of this study include: (1) identifying the green building attributes for rental depreciation and (2) prioritizing the green attributes via the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique. To achieve these objectives, firstly the study identified the green building attributes from the literature and from green building guidelines. The attributes were then validated by expert valuers via a semi-structured interview. Secondly, the attributes were utilized to develop the AHP-designed questionnaire and used to gather feedback from real estate experts. Ten (10) responses were analyzed using the descriptive and AHP techniques. This study has identified the rank of prioritized green building attributes, where the findings suggest the central role of indoor environment quality (EQ), where it ranked the highest in contributing to conventional purpose-built office (PBO) rental depreciation, followed by energy efficiency (EE), green site planning and management (SM), materials and resources (MR), innovation (IN), and water efficiency (WE). The findings allow researchers and practitioners to create strategies for reducing the impact of conventional building rental depreciation and obsolescence due to green building attributes.

TI  - Limits of household's energy efficiency improvements and its consequence - A case study for Hungary
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Many energy-efficiency programs at the national and EU levels target the residential building sector. Investment in the renovation of buildings results in increased energy efficiency and can minimise energy utilisation when up-to-date technique and accurate planning is performed. The realisation depends on many subjects. One critical objective in the planning process is the financial status of the families living in the building stock subject of the renovation projects. A complex approach is essential in housing renovation programs, and the consequences of different energy policies in each country should be considered. This study reports the possible level of Hungarian prebound and its consequence on the energy efficiency mortgage loans. The heating expenditure varies by household's income situation and/or the dwelling's technical characteristics. A mixed picture was found, reducing available expenditure and, typically, higher monthly savings rates for smaller dwellings. We found that the prebound and rebound effects and credit constraints might limit a nationwide energy renovation program. Furthermore, the fixed residential energy price policy can impair the effectiveness of housing renovation pro-grams. We found a minimal positive effect on banks' expected credit loss and the regulatory capital requirement on home energy-efficiency improvements.

TI  - Sustainability and Private Equity Real Estate Returns
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper explores private equity real estate fund performance and voluntary environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures. Using data from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF), it examines the relationship between performance for funds in the Open Ended Diversified Core Equity (ODCE) Index and reporting to the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), a platform for disclosure about fund/firm-level ESG strategies and performance. The empirical analyses suggest four conclusions. First, there has been substantial adoption of and reporting to GRESB in the last 5 years, suggesting that reporting to GRESB is a form of table stakes for ODCE members. Second, GRESB participation and performance are both significant predictors of cross-sectional fund returns. Third, GRESB participation and performance are associated with the price appreciation component of fund total returns but not with the income component. Fourth, the relationships between fund returns and GRESB participation and scores are independent of local economic conditions. These results close an important gap in the literature about private equity real estate fund performance and ESG/climate change mitigation efforts in commercial real estate markets.

TI  - A comparative analysis of renewable and non-renewable energy generation to relegate CO2 emissions and general costs in household systems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Ensuring adequate implementation of solar energy for providing environment-friendly energy to the household sector, which can considerably abate pollutants in the environment and make power industry structure sustainable, is necessary for developing countries. Comparison in terms of environmental and cost impacts of renewable energy (hybrid solar system) with non-renewable energy sources, water and planning development authority (WAPDA), and diesel generators (DGs) has been examined in the household sector of Pakistan. Primary data of hybrid solar systems have been obtained from 10 different households segregated them into two categories according to their income as medium-income households (MIHs) and lower income households (LIHs) containing 5 kW and 3 kW of hybrid solar energy systems, respectively. While operating with a hybrid solar energy system instead of a non-renewable energy system, in terms of average generated power and average running load, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can be reduced up to 8,446.6 kg CO2 and 6,131.725 kg CO2, respectively, in the next 25 years. Comparison of costs indicated that renewable energy has a comparatively low cost per electric unit. It can pay back its total installation cost in just 8 years and can save a sum of $4,936.4375, along with many more ecological, economic, and societal benefits. Pakistan can efficiently utilize solar energy to relegate CO2 emissions and general costs as it has distinct geographical features to access sunlight in most days of the year.

TI  - The assessment of green premium variation across different development scales: case of apartment complexes in Seoul, South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - Building sustainability has become a major objective in architecture due to buildings' significant contribution to the environment degradation. Like many other nations, South Korea has inaugurated the Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design (G-SEED) to address the issue of environmental loads caused by energy inefficient buildings. Due to the additional construction cost needed to obtain G-SEED certification, building stakeholders face challenges in deciding whether to invest in green building certification. In this study, we evaluate the existence and magnitude of the G-SEED price premium in Seoul, one of most densely populated cities in South Korea. We applied the hedonic pricing model to an extensive dataset of all housing transactions made during 2018 in all 25 districts of Seoul. Our findings indicate that the average price premium for a G-SEED certified apartment is 24.3%, with the premium being 18.3%, 31.0%, and 54.6% for small, medium, and large apartment complexes, respectively. We conclude that although the additional cost required to meet G-SEED certification criteria increases with the size of the development; green investment is profitable at all scales considered in this study.

TI  - A choice experiment for testing the energy-efficiency mortgage as a tool for promoting sustainable finance
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - The challenges currently facing the EU in the energy sector include increasing import dependence, limited diversification, high and volatile energy prices, decarbonization, and slow progress in energy efficiency. EU energy policy has provided a wide range of measures to achieve an integrated energy market and sustainability of the building sector. Various incentives and financial instruments have been promoted and financed by governments to help consumers in energy retrofit processes. These include direct investments and fiscal, financial, and market instruments. Public measures have been widely studied but private initiatives have not. In this study, the energy-efficiency mortgage (EEM) is investigated as a credit scheme to attract young people to a real estate market for sustainable buildings, characterized by high sale prices. A choice experiment (CE) was modelled to investigate the preferences of potential young buyers of a new home. The results of this exploratory survey showed an appreciation of the purchase of new A-rated properties according to the Energy Performance Certificate, compared to those that need to be retrofitted or not retrofitted. Consumers like the option of a home energy efficiency renovation being fully managed by a third party (i.e., following the one-stop shop model). The key appeal of energy efficiency for consumers ranges from its ability to support better energy management, to better property value management. The EEM seems to be a promising tool to stimulate investments in energy efficiency and to promote the accessibility and affordability of housing in the sustainable housing market. The results of this study can help private financial institutions to propose appropriate credit plans, which limit the risk of default by the borrower. They can also help public incentive policymakers to propose complementary instruments to EEM.

TI  - Position Paper Introducing a Sustainable, Universal Approach to Retrofitting Residential Buildings
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Protests during the 2021 Climate Conference in Glasgow exemplified our dilemma. The establishment perpetuates old thinking, while young people demand a new approach to mitigate the impact of climate change. The authors agree with the young people, and as a solution we propose to replace the current fragmentary approach with a new holistic one. The passive house approach that was conceptualized by the University of Illinois and built in Canada in 1977 showed us that energy consumption can be reduced about half of that used in the traditional design. Seventeen years later, a European passive house was built in Darmstadt. In 2008, a demonstration house in Syracuse, NY, showed that integrated passive measures produced energy use by about half of the NY state code for 2004. At the same time, some advanced houses in the USA showed total energy use of about 70 kWh/(m(2)center dot y). In 2008, at the first Building Enclosure Science and Technology Conference, two equally important objectives for 2030 were proposed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: (1) a 90% reduction of energy use in new buildings and (2) 50% for the retrofitting of existing buildings, i.e., to the level achieved in the 1980s. The first objective has recently been achieved in small buildings while the large residential buildings remain on the level obtained in the 2000s. Yet, the retrofitting of existing buildings (the second objective) has been a dismal failure. This paper acknowledges progress in hydronic heating and cooling involving electric heat pumps and hybrid solar panels, building automatics used for operation of HVAC, and modification of air distribution systems that comes from experience with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Furthermore, it highlights that to accelerate energy efficiency and carbon emission reductions, there must be broad public-private educational programs with demonstrations of a new generation of retrofitting. Economically and ecologically retrofitted buildings will create a new approach to real estate investment.

TI  - A Comparative Performance Analysis of Different Insulation Materials Installed in a Residential Building of a Cold Region in Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES SCIENCE
AB  - Globally, the building sector consumes approximately 60% of the total energy usage, while the energy consumption of residential buildings lies between 20% to 40%. The majority of this energy is operational energy, which comes mainly from the heating and cooling of houses. Innovative and cost-effective insulation materials have the potential to reduce the operational energy requirements and can therefore make the buildings more energy efficient. In this study, three commonly available insulation materials were experimentally evaluated for a case study of residential buildings, located in a cold region of Pakistan. Glass wool, extruded polystyrene, and polyethylene were used, as insulation materials, for monitoring the case study building performance. Thermal data were collected for 21 days in the year 2019 using a Testo Saveries System and were then used for analyzing the thermal performance of each of the three types of insulation materials. Other relevant data including the cost of insulation materials, thickness, ease of application, design life, and fire resistance of the selected insulation materials were obtained for broader (based on the scorecard) analysis based on a multi-weighted decision model. It was concluded that Polyethylene was the most economical insulation material amongst the others, which also showed the best thermal performance. Polyethylene was also found to be the best insulation material for the case study building based on a multi-weighted decision model and, hence, is recommended for application in buildings around cold regions of Pakistan.

TI  - Energy efficiency in the private rental sector in Victoria, Australia: When and why do small-scale private landlords retrofit?
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Energy efficiency in private rental properties is lower than that of owner-occupied homes. As landlords are the primary decision-makers for improving rental properties, understanding their energy efficiency behaviour is critical to improving the uptake of energy efficiency retrofits in the private rental sector. However, little is known about how landlords make decisions about energy efficiency retrofits. The study aims to understand when and why landlords decide to retrofit and identify policy implications, using the private rental sector in Victoria as a case study. The results show that proactive retrofitting by landlords is rare and that the retrofits undertaken were generally low-cost, incremental energy efficiency improvements. Most retrofit activity was prompted by gov-ernment subsidies, tenant requests, or appliance breakdown. Despite its significance for energy efficiency, ret-rofitting behaviour was not related to environmental values. Instead, landlords considered financial implications and tenants' needs. However, landlords who used property managers had little understanding of tenants' needs. Policymakers can use this understanding of landlords' behaviour by creating new retrofit prompts and high-lighting the impacts of energy inefficiency on tenants' wellbeing. Transitioning the private rental sector to low-energy housing requires integrated policy to change the behaviour of landlords, tenants, and property managers.

TI  - Drivers of UK household energy expenditure: Promoting efficiency and curbing emissions
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Energy use at the country level is largely influenced by residential energy use, and therefore, understanding household behaviour can contribute towards improving energy efficiency. With the UK target of net-zero emissions by 2050, an understanding of the factors that can reduce residential energy use may help policymakers design policies reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, we analyse the determinants of UK energy expenditure in 2011-2020, by examining the impacts of household factors, dwelling characteristics, and energy prices on household electricity and gas expenditure, separately for owner-occupied homes and rented accommodations. Our results suggest that renters are more sensitive to changes in electricity and gas prices than homeowners, by about 23% and 7% respectively. However, changes in income affect homeowners more than renters. Overall, the results suggest that the key drivers of electricity and gas expenditure are household size, number of rooms, and urban location, with homeowners generally being more sensitive. As renters are more price sensitive, we recommend that policymakers offer monetary or legislative incentives to landlords to make energy efficiency improvements in their rented properties, such as double glazing or solar panels. The government should also use our results to give households recommendations on energy conservation, promoting environmentally conscious behaviour.

TI  - Residential Building Codes Do Save Energy: Evidence from Hourly Smart-Meter Data
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
AB  - In 1978, California adopted building codes designed to reduce the energy used for temperature control. Using a rich data set of hourly electricity consumption for 158,112 houses in Sacramento, we estimate that the average house built just after 1978 uses 8% to 13% less electricity for cooling than a similar house built just before 1978. Comparing the estimated savings to the policy's projected cost, our results suggest the policy passes a cost-benefit test. In settings where market failures prevent energy costs from being completely passed through to home prices, building codes can serve as a cost- effective tool for improving energy efficiency.

TI  - Does energy efficiency matter for prices of tenant-owned apartments?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - In this study, we use Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) information to investigate the effect of energy efficiency on the selling price of Swedish tenant-owned apartments. While there is a large body of literature on how energy efficiency affects the sales price of single-family houses, none has exclusively focused on tenant-owned apartments. For owners of tenant-owned apartments in Sweden, heating is for a large share included in the monthly fee paid to the tenant association, which usually does not change on a short-term basis. This raises the question whether homebuyers' incentives for acquiring energy-efficient tenant-owned apartments are large enough to be capitalized into the prices. By hedonic models and matching methods, we found mixed results. In our most optimistic scenarios, tenant-owned apartments enclosed in energy-efficient buildings are sold with a premium of approximately 0.8 to 1.2% compared to apartments in non-efficient buildings. The results in this study are not robust to all model specifications and vary across regions. In comparison with recent studies using data for single-family houses in Sweden, our detected capitalization is smaller. Our results highlight a need for targeted measures if EPCs are to be fully capitalized in prices for all dwelling types in which buyers have different economic incentives for reducing their energy consumption.

TI  - The Effect of the Swiss CO2 Levy on Heating Fuel Demand of Private Real Estate Owners
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - To effectively mitigate climate change, it is crucial to better understand the reaction of fossil-fuel demand to price and tax changes, and more precisely to climate policy instruments such as a carbon levy. The Swiss CO2 levy on heating fuels was introduced in 2008 at CHF 12/tCO(2)eq, and was increased steadily up to CHF 84/tCO(2)eq during the period of 2016/2017. This paper investigated the effectiveness of the levy as an instrument to reduce heating fuel demand, and hence carbon emissions, of private real estate owners. The Swiss Household Budget Survey 2006-2017 constituted the main data source. Before-after and pseudo-panel regressions were used to capture the CO2 levy's effects, and a large set of household characteristics, as well as climatic conditions, were controlled for. No significant effects in the first two policy periods of 2008-2013 were found. Over the period of 2014-2017, a significant reduction in house owners' heating fuel demand of up to 14% with respect to 2006-2007 was detected. The effect was less significant and smaller in magnitude for flat owners. A significant CO2 levy semielasticity of heating fuel demand of -1.3% for house owners was further estimated. Hence, the results confirmed the effectiveness of the CO2 levy under the conditions that the levy was sufficiently high, as during the years of 2014-2017, and households directly paid the levy and were responsible for decisions concerning heating and insulation, as was the case for house owners.

TI  - Green and Gold Buildings? Detecting Real Estate Market Premium for Green Buildings through Evolutionary Polynomial Regression
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - This study concerns the determination of empirical evidence of a real estate market premium for Green Buildings and of an aware role of the private real estate market as driver to foster-up urban and architectural sustainability and energy efficiency. In real estate markets, there is growing relevance of Green Buildings, especially in cities where the greater part of residential buildings is built before the first regulations on energy performance. Through policies oriented towards sustainable practices, a twofold goal can be achieved: energy consumption mitigation respecting the historical value for existing buildings, direct economic impacts on real estate values. In some metropolitan or urban contexts, the "green premium" for buildings can be understood as a real "gold premium". This result has been highlighted and quantified with a real estate market analysis developed for a central area of an Italian mid-size city, pursued through the innovative tool of Evolutionary Polynomial Regression (EPR). The study highlighted a higher sale price for properties characterized by the best ecological characteristics and energy efficiency (+41.52%).

TI  - Delivering net-zero carbon heat: Technoeconomic and whole-system comparisons of domestic electricity- and hydrogen-driven technologies in the UK
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Proposed sustainable transition pathways for moving away from natural gas in domestic heating focus on two main energy vectors: electricity and hydrogen. Electrification would be implemented by using vapour-compression heat pumps, which are currently experiencing market growth in many countries. On the other hand, hydrogen could substitute natural gas in boilers or be used in thermally-driven absorption heat pumps. In this paper, a consistent thermodynamic and economic methodology is developed to assess the competitiveness of these options. The three technologies, along with the option of district heating, are for the first time compared for different weather/ambient conditions and fuel-price scenarios, first from a homeowner's and then from a whole-energy system perspective. For the former, two-dimensional decision maps are generated to identify the most cost-effective technologies for different combinations of fuel prices. It is shown that, in the UK, hydrogen technologies are economically favourable if hydrogen is supplied to domestic end-users at a price below half of the electricity price. Otherwise, electrification and the use of conventional electric heat pumps will be preferred. From a whole-energy system perspective, the total system cost per household (which accounts for upstream generation and storage, as well as technology investment, installation and maintenance) associated with electric heat pumps varies between 790 and 880 & POUND;/year for different scenarios, making it the least-cost decarbonisation pathway. If hydrogen is produced by electrolysis, the total system cost associated with hydrogen technologies is notably higher, varying between 1410 and 1880 & POUND;/year. However, this total system cost drops to 1150 & POUND;/year with hydrogen produced cost-effectively by methane reforming and carbon capture and storage, thus reducing the gap between electricity-and hydrogen-driven technologies.

TI  - Thermal comfort in a tropical savanna climate: The case of home occupants in Darwin, Australia
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Housing construction and operating costs can be reduced if building codes are designed to meet local expectations of thermal comfort -expectations that can vary across cultures and climates. We analysed the energy and thermal comfort performance of 38 recently-built houses in the tropical savanna (Aw) cli-mate of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia with 4 to 7 star ratings according to the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS). Thermal comfort and personal adaptive behaviours of the 69 occupants were assessed using a questionnaire while, simultaneously, indoor environmental parameters were mon-itored. Perceptions of thermal comfort were then compared to those predicted from modelling. We found that many people were comfortable in warmer and more humid conditions than is assumed by national building codes, with many people opting for use of fans at set at high speeds instead. Large lots close to parks had the lowest use of air conditioners in the warm seasons, with very little air-conditioner use at other times. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - How higher-order personal values affect the purchase of electricity storage-Evidence from the German photovoltaic market
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Why do consumers make different decisions even when socioeconomic conditions are similar? The present article examines the effects of human values-as formulations of motivational goals-on the decision to purchase electricity storage for a photovoltaic system, a phenomenon hardly explored in prior research regarding high-priced household investments. About 50 percent of photovoltaic-system owners in Germany are also owners of an electricity storage. This study aims to explore the more deeply rooted motivational factors behind these different decisions to extend our understanding of consumers' decision-making processes regarding energy-efficiency investments. It is based on an online survey of 460 owners of residential photovoltaic systems in Germany in 2019 and focuses on the interplay between higher-order values, purchase decisions, perceived risk, and environmental concern. The analysis of the higher-order values showed direct effects of conservation and self-transcendence and indirect effects of openness to change and self-enhancement, both mediated by perceived risk.

TI  - Asymmetric co-integration relationship among coal production, real estate development, and CO2 emissions in China
T2  - ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB  - The real estate industry is associated with coal production and CO2 emissions. The nonlinear ARDL (AutoRegressive Distributed Lag) co-integration method was used to analyze the effects of long-term and short-term real estate development and CO2 emissions on coal production. The results showed that: (1) The positive and negative impacts of CO2 emissions on coal production were similar in the long. Moreover, CO2 emissions negatively affected coal production; (2) In the long run, the positive impact of real estate development on coal production is greater than the negative impact, though it is not significant. In the short term, the negative shock of real estate effectively reduced coal production; (3) The impact of coal production on CO2 emissions is symmetric in both the long and short term. Therefore, in the future, real estate should develop moderately. In addition, lessening coal production demand is crucial to ensure coal production reduction and carbon neutrality.

TI  - How heterogeneous is the impact of energy efficiency on dwelling prices? Evidence from the application of the unconditional quantile hedonic model to the Portuguese residential market
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper studies the impact of energy efficiency on the unconditional distribution of residential property prices in Portugal. Using a dataset of more than 256,000 residential property sales from 2009 to 2013, a period that covers an economic depression, unconditional quantile regression analysis reveals that the responsiveness to energy efficiency improvements is different not only as we move from low- to high-priced residential units but also between apartments and houses. While apartments show a downward trend in the magnitude of energy efficiency coefficient estimates, the opposite occurs for houses. This last property type exhibits clear price discounts at the lowest quantiles of the price distribution, something that is not observable through conditional mean and quantile regression analysis. Our results suggest the existence of a different level of responsiveness to energy efficiency improvements in the Lisbon region when compared to the rest of the country and that the impact of the Energy Performance Certificate label increases throughout time across all price quantiles. As a byproduct of this paper, an unconditional quantile price index shows how the impact of the crisis was not the same across different market segments, with more severe price decreases for low- than high-priced properties.

TI  - Improving Life Cycle Sustainability and Profitability of Buildings through Optimization: A Case Study
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Building developers are continuously seeking solutions to increase saleable/rentable floor area and thus the profitability of investments, especially in large/dense cities where the real estate/rental values are high and shortage of available land results in smaller building footprints. Application of passive energy efficiency measures (e.g., thick insulation in walls) not only affects the life cycle sustainability of buildings, but also the floor area and its profitability. This can affect the decisions made on the choice of measures when aiming to improve sustainability. In line with limited studies in this context, a case study is presented here in which multi-objective optimization was used to explore the impact of various passive energy efficiency measures on the life cycle sustainability when accounting for the profitability of the floor area. The building case was a high-rise apartment based on a standardized building concept situated in different locations in Sweden, namely Vindeln, Gothenburg, and Stockholm. The findings indicated that, regardless of the location, use of (1) thick cellulose coating for the roof, and (2) moderately thick expanded polystyrene for the floor, were necessary to improve the life cycle sustainability. However, the optimal wall insulation was dependent on the location; in locations with high real estate values, the scope for using thick and conventional insulations (mineral wool/cellulose) was limited due to the significant economic loss caused by floor area reductions. In general, the optimization identified optimal solutions that could save up to 1410.7 GJ energy, 23 tonnes CO(2)e, and 248.4 TEUR cost from a life cycle perspective relative to the building's initial design.

TI  - Price discount of green residential building in China's second-hand housing market: Evidence from Shenzhen
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
AB  - China has witnessed a rapid growth of green building in the past few years. Green building development in residential sector is relatively slow. This paper provides nuanced evidence for explaining the slow growth of green residential building (GRB) based on a case study of the market in Shenzhen. This paper uses hedonic pricing models with a unique transaction dataset to find out an average price discount of 11.94% for GRB in second-hand housing market. Such price discount of GRB grows as housing price rises, insinuating that expensive housing obtains greater economic loss from green label. Our findings drawn from employing heterogeneity analysis show that the GRBs being sold in spring and winter tend to have a smaller price discount than those sold in summer and autumn. The GRBs with more rooms and parlors, however, tend to have a greater price discount in second-hand housing market. Our findings confirm that both building age and distance to central business district (CBD) offset the value loss resulting from green label. This study conveys a negative message to the economic return of GRB in China's second-hand housing market. Our findings advocate strong policy incentives to promote demand for GRB and reduce pertinent market barriers.

TI  - The effect of energy performance ratings over residential prices or how an insufficient control of architectural-quality may render spurious conclusions
T2  - CITIES
AB  - The European Union has relied upon information symmetry theory to foster decarbonization of existing buildings in cities under the hypothesis that efficient buildings receive a market premium. Hedonic analysis of housing prices across European cities suggests the existence of such a premium; while opinion-based research concludes that households pay scarce attention to energy performance when letting or buying a home. These approaches render inconclusive evidence regarding the role of energy-information symmetry as public policy in climate change mitigation through market prices. Since energy-efficiency attributes are contingent on the architectural quality of homes, poor control of the latter in hedonic models may bring biased conclusions regarding the former. The main contribution of this piece is to improve the control of these non-energy attributes using a visual inspection of listed apartments in Madrid and Barcelona. Results suggest that the energy-efficiency price premium completely disappears when other quality attributes are considered in full. This finding has large implications for energy and city policies.

TI  - Analysing the drivers of the efficiency of households in electricity consumption
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Households play a very relevant role in energy demand in general and electricity demand in particular. Although electricity is an essential product in our daily life, reductions of electricity demand have generally been defended on environmental and energy security grounds. The aim of this paper is to analyse the level and the drivers of efficiency in household electricity consumption using an estimator for endogenous stochastic frontiers. A panel of data is built for this purpose, using statistical matching techniques with seven waves of the Spanish Household Budget Survey (SHBS) from 2006 to 2012. Several economic and non-economic variables are considered, including income, household features and characteristics of the dwelling. Our findings suggest that the level of electricity efficiency is already relatively high for households in all income levels. The results also reveal that there is a negative relation between income and efficiency in electricity consumption, i.e., that the lowest income households are also the most efficient. Furthermore, one feature of dwellings (the number of rooms) and two features of households (their size and the educational level) are relevant drivers of household efficiency in electricity consumption. Whereas the educational level and household size negatively affect electricity efficiency, the number of rooms positively influences efficiency. Our findings suggest that general price-based measures which drive the adoption of electricity efficient technologies and behaviors should be complemented with two types of policy interventions: policies which encourage households to be more efficient (i.e., information pro-vision and financial support for the adoption of electricity-efficient practices) and measures specifically targeted at low-income households which mitigate the comparatively greater distributional impact of price increases on this household segment.

TI  - Valuing sustainability Part 2: Australian valuers' perception of sustainability in valuation practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The research investigates valuers' understanding of the value of sustainability in property and its' consideration in valuation practice in Australia. This paper explores valuers' perceptions of the relationships between sustainability and market values, sustainability and valuation variables, and the value influence of industry sustainability certification schemes. Further, this paper tracks prevalence of certified buildings in Australian commercial markets and the evolution of valuers' knowledge of sustainability certifications used in Australia. Design/methodology/approach This paper reports on the next rendition of a longitudinal study examining valuers' practice in Australia. This research explores the evolution of Australian valuers' perception and knowledge of sustainability in valuation practice. The survey data has been periodically collected from practising valuers from 2007 to 2021. The survey questions investigate valuers' knowledge development, understanding, reporting and consideration of the relationship between sustainability and market value. Findings The results have identified the evolution of the influence of normative research on valuers' perceptions of the relationship between sustainability and value; with a clearer understanding emerging over time of where the value relationships are identified in valuation variables. Greater alignment between empirical Australian studies and valuers' perceptions of the influence of sustainability ratings on value, demonstrate the value connection for higher rated buildings under NABERS (energy rating) and Green Star. Whilst only 41% of the study's participants are including sustainability in their valuation reports, they include a higher level of commentary on building descriptions and initiatives, building ratings, and reporting of owner and tenant objectives, than in previous studies. Knowledge development relating to sustainability certification tool, NABERS was identified. This is likely linked to the introduction of mandatory disclosure legislation. This has also led to increased awareness and valuers' knowledge of the differences between the two key rating tools used in Australia. Research limitations/implications The research has several limitations: firstly, recruitment of valuers and the number of valuers' responses has varied over time; secondly, due to collection methods respondents have a greater likelihood of having an interest in and knowledge of sustainability creating potential for positive bias; thirdly, respondents may have responded to the survey in different years, but due to anonymity there has been no ability to track this. The results provide insights into the Australian valuation profession but may not be fully representative of the profession overall in Australia. Practical implications The broader agenda of net zero, climate change, mitigation and carbon requirements, whether driven by market forces or government legislation, are generating changes in property markets as investors' reconsider their positions and model the implications of carbon emissions on their bottom lines. Introductions of policy and legislation over time in the Australian context have led to changes in valuation practice and increasing consideration of energy efficiency and ratings in the valuation of assets.
   However, further guidance and research still is required in Australia to assist in the knowledge development of valuers, and their ability to consider the emerging effects of sustainability, net zero and other market driven objectives including legislation, and how these may affect or influence their evaluation of market evidence and thus property values. Originality/value The research has tracked valuers' understanding, knowledge, and consideration of sustainability and energy efficiency in valuation practice since 2007. In that time the research has found that, as the market has evolved and more rated buildings are built (or retrofitted), so too has valuers' knowledge and consideration in valuation practices evolved. Valuers are more engaged with industry rating tools such as NABERS. This suggests that the Australian mandatory disclosure policies have contributed to changes in the market, which are then interpreted by valuers and reflected in their perceptions and consideration of energy ratings in valuation practice.

The second paper provides the next rendition of a longitudinal study examining valuation practice in Australia. Findings The paper provides an overview of the evolution of the consideration of sustainability in property over the past two decades. Providing insights of how the property sector, its markets and valuation professionals have responded to answering the questions of: what is the value of sustainability? Whilst earlier publications both industry and academic publications alike focussed on the normative aspects of how sustainability should affect value, more recent research starts to ascertain the implications of sustainability on property values. Despite industry bodies providing information, education, guidelines and standards, it would seem that valuers in their practice are still grappling with the challenges of understanding the rapidly evolving area of sustainability, environmental, social and governance and climate risks in valuations. Research limitations/implications The paper does not present as an authority on all research that has been conducted to date, it provides an overview of the evolving nature of both academic research and industry consideration of sustainability, particularly in a valuation context. This provides the background for Part 2. Practical implications The broader agenda of net zero, climate change, mitigation and carbon requirements, whether driven by market forces or government legislation, are generating substantial changes in property markets, as investors reconsider their positions and model the implications of carbon emissions on their bottom lines. Government policies appear to have a considerable influence over market behaviours, which filters through to stakeholder decision-making. However, despite government policies, clear market signalling and industry body guidance on valuing sustainability, the content and depth of sustainability consideration in valuation are still limited. Originality/value The paper provides an overview of the last decade of research into the value of sustainability and the evolving nature of information and guidance for valuers to identify, evaluate and consider sustainability in valuation.

TI  - A framework for integrated energy and exposure to ambient pollution (iEnEx) assessment toward low-carbon, healthy, and equitable cities
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - This research develops a framework for integrated energy and exposure to ambient pollution (iEnEx) assessment addressing energy, health, and equity as an interconnected problem within the built environment. Its focus is to explore spatial disparities of households' energy burden and their exposure to ambient particulate matters (PM2.5 as end point) in supporting energy efficiency goals of cities. In this study, energy burden is defined as energy affordability of households for paying energy costs. And natural ventilation (NV) is examined as a catalyst of building energy efficiency to measure tradeoffs between energy burden mitigation and exposure to ambient PM2.5 pollution. The framework is built upon a five-step workflow using spatiotemporal land use regression (LUR) with gradient boosting machine (GBM) and bringing human behavioral patterns along with array of urban big data from smart cities platforms into the model to improve the explanatory capacities of the exposure model. We tested Chicago, IL as a case study. Findings indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in integrating urban energy and human health systems for envisioning urban building energy reduction goals. A web-based interactive platform is designed to communicate the results. iEnEx framework can assist designers, engineers, planners, and policymakers in better understanding these systems from environmental and social lenses in the context of equity within the built environment to ensure future sustainable cities.

TI  - Energy Retrofitting for the Modern Heritage Enhancement in Weak Real Estate Markets: The Olivetti Housing Stock in Ivrea
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The enhancement of Modern Heritage buildings is nowadays a challenging issue as they are often degraded or abandoned and their historical value is not well acknowledged by potential buyers and their owners. Moreover, they are usually energy inefficient and obsolete, but investments for energy retrofit interventions are not always convenient, especially in socio-economic contexts characterized by weak real-estate market dynamics. This paper aims to study the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics on housing prices and, in particular, to understand whether elements of building cultural connotations or some housing green features are monetized by the real estate market. The UNESCO site "Ivrea, industrial city of the 20th century", located in the weak real-estate context of the Eporediese territorial area, was selected as an emblematic case study and two data samples of property listings were built to perform spatial regression analyses. The results showed that the green features of housing, such as the heating type and the EPC level, have a greater influence on property prices than those characteristics related to the cultural connotations of a building, such as the Olivettian context. Therefore, the current incentive-based policies for energy efficiency can represent great opportunities that can be exploited both to preserve and to improve the condition of this valuable Modern Heritage.

TI  - "Show Me the Energy Costs": Short and Long-term Energy Cost Disclosure Effects on Willingness-to-pay for Residential Energy Efficiency
T2  - ENERGY JOURNAL
AB  - Imperfect information on future energy costs can lower the demand for more en-ergy efficient technologies, with clear implications for energy supply, emissions and climate change. These hypotheses are explored using a randomised discrete choice experiment for property rental decisions. Results show that when energy consumption is expressed in physical units (as per the current EU labels) the will-ingness-to-pay for energy efficiency improvements is small and marginally sig-nificant. While bimonthly energy cost information displayed in monetary terms has no effect on the valuation of energy efficiency, annual monetary energy cost information led to a significant increase. This is the first paper to compare short and long-term point of sale energy cost information for household property deci-sions. There are clear implications for labelling policy for properties-framing energy consumption according to long-term monetary cost increases the demand for energy efficiency.

TI  - The Role of Mandatory Building Efficiency Disclosure on Green Building Price Premium: Evidence from Australia
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Extensive studies have examined the financial performance of green buildings in recent years. The results have frequently observed that the premium of green buildings is time-varying and dependent on the study period and markets being examined. Further, virtually no dedicated study has been devoted to examine the role of mandatory building energy rating disclosure policies on green building price premium. This raises the question of whether the mandatory energy rating disclosure policies would have an influence on the financial performance of green buildings. This study assesses the premium of green buildings by considering the role of mandatory energy efficiency of commercial building disclosure program (CBDP) using the MCSI/IPD NABERS data over 2005-2020. The results of the study showed that, in Australia, buildings with NABERS rating of 4 stars and above delivered a higher total return compared with buildings with lower NABERS ratings. This also supports the Freeman's (1984) social impact hypothesis in which favorable social performance will ultimately lead to favorable financial performance. In addition, our empirical modelling results also demonstrated the premium of green buildings is stronger since the launch of CBDP, reflecting the importance of mandatory building efficiency disclosure. The policy implications of our studies have also been discussed as buildings play a crucial role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly net-zero carbon emissions.

TI  - The Hungarian utility cost reduction programme: An impact assessment
T2  - ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB  - In Hungary, regulated energy prices fell by a quarter in 2013-2014 due to a state intervention. The objective of this article is to measure the effects of this change on the Hungarian residential energy consumption and assess the rationale, the policy context and other consequences of such an intervention. We decompose residential energy-use change in 2010-2018. We calculate 13.2 PJ of excess consumption relating to the programme, and find that the higher income deciles benefited the most from the lower prices compared to low-income households using market-priced lower-quality fuels and living in inefficient homes. The intervention lacked a strong policy background. The energy policy documents were later adjusted to the situation and finally the programme was linked to energy poverty. We point to price-setting failures and discrepancies between energy-efficiency goals and measures as well as negative effects of these and the programme itself. In the future, the policy emphasis should be on energy efficiency and supporting those really in need.

TI  - Modeling occupant behavior's influence on the energy efficiency of solar domestic hot water systems
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - Solar hot water (SHW) systems are widely used to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions. The domestic hot water (DHW) usage behavior of occupants has a significant influence on the energy consumption of SHW systems; the operation of SHW systems also affects the DHW usage of occupants. However, there is a lack of quantitative analysis for coordinating DHW behavior and the design and operation of SHW systems to maximize solar energy utilization and reduce energy consumption. Therefore, an information-driven stochastic DHW usage model that interacts with SHW systems is proposed. The optimal design and control strategies for SHW systems to match user behaviors were explored. Meanwhile, the effects of occupants' sensitivity to water temperature and their energy-saving awareness on the energy performance of SHW systems were studied. The results showed that optimal design and control strategies based on the actual DHW profile can increase the annual solar energy utilization rate by 11.5%, and the corresponding electricity savings, CO2 emission reduction, and cost saving are 163.10 kWh, 145.52 kg, and 81.06 RMB, per household. The location of the reheater had a significant influence on the energy performance and optimal measures of the SHW systems. Moreover, based on technologies or policies to adjust hot water demand, the water supply capacity of SHW systems can be matched with the hot water demand, which can improve the efficiency of solar energy utilization, save 8.5% of electrical energy for reheating, and lead to a 107.55 kg CO2 reduction and 59.91 RMB cost saving per household per year.

TI  - Application of cumulative prospect theory in understanding energy retrofit decision: A study of homeowners in the Netherlands
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Retrofitting residential buildings can help mitigate the effects of climate change. Cognitive biases are systematic deviations from rationality in decision making and can lead to inaction, delay, and uncertain decisions. Understanding the cognitive biases involved in residential renovation decisions and developing interventions to overcome them can help increase residential renovation rates. Despite their importance, few studies have examined the impact of cognitive biases on energy retrofits. The question addressed in this study is: "Can accounting for cognitive biases improve the prediction of homeowners' actual investment decisions, and how can the outcomes be used to recommend potential behavioural interventions?". Expected Utility Theory (EUT) and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) are compared to evaluate which model(s) more accurately describes actual decision-making behaviour regarding energy retrofits. The EUT assumes a rational decision maker. The CPT is a quantitative model that assumes a decision maker operating under risk and uncertainty and subject to the cognitive biases of reference dependence, loss aversion, decreasing sensitivity, and probability weighting. The influences of cognitive biases on energy retrofit decisions can be quantified if the relative performance of CPT versus EUT is more accurate. The data for these analyses come from housing surveys conducted in the Netherlands in 2012 and 2018, which also collected data on energy modules. 2,784 and 2,878 homeowners were surveyed, respectively. The model is validated by estimating the coefficients of EUT and CPT and identifying the similarities and differences between the results of the two datasets. Before estimating the parameters, four household clusters are identified using grey relational analysis and the K-Means cluster. For the first time, the EUT and CPT parameters are estimated for four clusters and two energy retrofits, double glazing and insulation, using a genetic algorithm because the equations are nonlinear. The results confirm that CPT provides a better description of the actual decision behaviour than EUT using the two previously established initial values of Layard et al. (2008) and Hackel et al. (2017) as well as the parameters estimated by the genetic algorithm. In the latter case, CPT correctly predicts the decisions of 86% of homeowners to renovate their homes to be energy efficient or not. EUT, on the other hand, overestimates the number of decisions to renovate: it incorrectly predicts retrofit for 52% of homeowners who did not renovate for energy efficiency reasons. Using the estimated parameters of CPT, the cognitive biases of reference dependence, loss aversion, diminishing sensitivity, and probability weighting can be clearly seen for different target groups. The groups with the highest average incomes and house values had the highest loss risk aversion parameters. These households invested more in installing insulation and double glazing.

TI  - Investigation on household energy consumption of urban residential buildings in major cities of Indonesia during COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The implementation of the movement control order (MCO) to curb the spread of the 2019 novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) have influenced household energy consumption patterns around the world. This study aims to investigate household energy consumption of urban residential buildings in major cities of Indonesia during COVID-19 pandemic. Three representative major cities of Indonesia were selected to investigate detailed information about household appliances and gas consumption through face-to-face interviews in 2021 (n = 311). The factors affecting household energy consumption were investigated by multiple regression analysis. The results showed that, overall, the average annual energy consumption of all samples during pandemic was approximately 23.5 GJ, 3.0 GJ larger than before pandemic. The difference was primarily attributed to the use of air conditioning and cooking. The statistical analysis clearly indicated that the increase in household income (low-to high-cost houses), which would increase household size and number of appliances including air conditioning, thus increased total household energy consumption. We recommended the following potential energy-saving strategies for urban houses in Indonesia: (a) control the number of family members, (b) use more energy efficiency standards for electrical appliances and (c) encourage energy-saving lifestyles, particularly to younger adults by adopting passive cooling techniques (window opening) whereever possible.

TI  - Energy conservation literacy among households in Sub-Sahara Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose Energy conservation literacy within households is a contemporary and topical issue globally. However, scant research has been conducted on energy-saving literacy amongst Ghanaian households. To substantiate the problem, this paper aims to examine energy conservation literacy and behaviours among Ghanaian households in the Greater Accra Region. Design/methodology/approach The study assessed household electricity use and explored determinants of household energy conservation behaviours. Data was collected through a survey administered to households within the target region and analysed using descriptive statistics and Spearmen's rank correlation. Findings Results showed electricity conservation among households is greatly influenced by the number of household occupants, household income levels, and the quality and quantity of appliances. The study also found that conservation behaviours are positively correlated to the number of occupants, household income levels, the quantity of electrical appliances, age of household members, number of rooms and level of urbanization within the home's geographical region. Cumulatively, the findings suggest households held positive attitudes towards efficient energy practices. Enigmatically, the use of energy-conserving alternative technologies was not widely used by households; hence, this factor does not significantly affect household energy conservation. Research limitations/implications Although limited to Ghana's capital region, the findings can be used to inform policy and regulations at the regional and national levels in designing an efficient and effective mechanism to reduce the country's overall energy use. Practical implications Premised upon the findings, the study recommends an intensification of education and awareness-creation on various energy-saving regulations and initiatives and thorough education on the usage of standardized (approved) refrigerators to promote the consistent adoption of energy conservation measures among households. Originality/value This study pioneers investigations into the influence of household demographic variables on overall electricity conservation behaviours exhibited by Ghanaian households

TI  - Integration of phasing on multi-objective optimization of building stock energy retrofit
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Decision making for the energy retrofit of building stock is key to improve the energy efficiency and comfort in buildings. This article present a methodology developed in order to help the building stock or real estate manager to improve the efficiency of his buildings. The methodology is based on the multiobjective optimization of the retrofit, and specifically of the walls and windows of the buildings. The paper presents the integration of a temporal dimension with the phasing of the construction work in the retrofit strategies on multiple buildings in order to get closer to real world practice in the construction sites. The case study is carried out on a small building stock with the NSGA-II genetic algorithm. The search space of the optimization are vertical and horizontal walls and windows of each building; objective functions are heating demand, price of the proposed retrofit and an overheating indicator based on adaptive comfort. Overheating and heating demand are evaluated using EnergyPlus simulations. Phasing is implemented directly into the optimization formalisation with a separated chromosome describing temporality. As a result, different retrofit strategies were obtained by integrating phasing than with a standard optimisation with no temporal planning of operations. The main difference lies into the which building is selected to be retrofitted first, and in the improved performance of each retrofit material proposed: it led to an increase of performance of 10% in the overheating while thermal performance decreased for 2% in the retrofit strategies possible in reality when including the phasing. These results highlight the importance of formulating the optimization problem as close as possible to the real world constraints in construction in order to have accurate retrofit strategies.

TI  - Profitability in construction: how does building renovation business fare compared to new building business
T2  - CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS
AB  - In recent decades, energy-efficiency improvements and ageing dwelling stocks have grown the renovation need in many countries. This research compares the profitability of building renovation companies and companies specializing in new construction using financial statement analysis and analysis of variance. Profitability is assessed through EBITDA and return on assets (ROA). Debt to equity (D/E) ratio as a solvency measure supports the analysis. The findings show micro and small companies in the new building sector have a statistically significant advantage in EBITDA over renovation in same size groups; projects in the renovation sector appear to be more complex, especially in terms of design, causing cost overruns. The more cyclical nature of new construction, however, equalizes EBITDA differences over time. Medium-size companies overall had the lowest EBITDA following the 2008-2009 financial crisis. ROA was generally higher for the renovation sector highlighting the more capital-intensive nature of new construction; unsold apartments and land for future projects hold capital, which results in higher D/E ratios. D/E ratios also revealed that both sectors have faced the COVID-19 pandemic less indebted compared to the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Since both sectors' profitability has been decreasing during the research period (2005-2019), actions are needed especially in the renovation sector, which has an increasingly important role in developed societies.

TI  - Boosting the choice of energy-efficient home appliances: the effectiveness of two types of decision support
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Consumers' limitations in assessing the lifetime cost of household appliances may sustain the much-cited energy efficiency gap. We analyse the impact of an individual's energy and investment literacy and two different types of decision support on the ability to identify the appliance with the lower lifetime cost in an online randomized controlled trial among two independently chosen samples of the Swiss population. In a decision task, participants choose between appliances with different lifetime cost. One treatment offers a short education programme on how to calculate the lifetime cost of an appliance - via a set of information slides. The second treatment provides access to an online lifetime-cost calculator tool. We find that pre-treatment energy and investment literacy are positively associated with the probability of identifying the appliance with the lowest lifetime cost. Evidence in this paper suggest that both decision aids boost identification of energy-efficient appliances. We discuss strategies to scale up these boosters.

TI  - A measurement strategy to address disparities across household energy burdens
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Net energy metrics reveal disparities in United States household energy burdens. Here the authors find that at least five million households are excluded from current accounting methods, with race, education, and housing tenure accounting for large differences in energy burden.
   Energy inequity is an issue of increasing urgency. Few policy-relevant datasets evaluate the energy burden of typical American households. Here, we develop a framework using Net Energy Analysis and household socioeconomic data to measure systematic energy inequity among critical groups that need policy attention. We find substantial instances of energy poverty in the United States - 16% of households experience energy poverty as presently defined as spending more than 6% of household income on energy expenditures. More than 5.2 million households above the Federal Poverty Line face energy poverty, disproportionately burdening Black, Hispanic, and Native American communities. For solar, wind, and energy efficiency to address socioeconomic mobility, programs must reduce energy expenditures by expanding eligibility requirements for support and access to improved conservation measures, efficiency upgrades, and distributed renewables. We recommend the United States develop a more inclusive federal energy poverty categorization that increases assistance for household energy costs.

TI  - Energy Community Measures Evaluation via Differential Evolution Optimization
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Energy communities are paving the way for new cooperation opportunities related to energy consumption and energy production. Individuals unite in energy communities to reduce the costs related to energy consumption. Although previous work has mainly focused on energy exchange inside the community. This work aims to investigate the Pareto-optimal solutions to the transformation of a historical district into an energy community. For energy efficiency and production measure calculation, a system dynamics model is developed. Multi-objective differential evolution optimization method is employed for the evaluation of energy efficiency and production measures with a focus on net present value, self-sufficiency, annual emission reduction, and specific heat consumption. The optimization target functions can be increased at a cost in net present value. Replacement of household appliances and windows enables significant energy demand reductions while maintaining positive net present value. Electricity production from photovoltaic panels otters an additional pathway to increase selfsufficiency share while maintaining positive net present value.

TI  - Current Status of Old Housing for Low-Income Elderly Households in Seoul and Green Remodeling Support Plan: Economic Analysis Considering the Social Cost of Green Remodeling
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - In this study, the economic feasibility of green remodeling (GR), which could improve the health, safety, and energy of elderly households considering social cost, was analyzed. As a result, the net present value of GR was '-10,267 USD (49.7%)', which was found to be uneconomical compared to the total construction cost (20,981 USD, 100%) despite benefits of energy saving, carbon reduction, and air pollutant reduction. Based on this result, in order to expand GR for low-income elderly households, who cannot afford to perform GR, a GR support measure linked to the currently implemented energy conversion and old-age housing support policies was proposed. It allows the government to perform GR for low-income elderly households with 1/4 of the total construction cost. This result could revitalize GR to reduce greenhouse gas and contribute to housing stability for low-income elderly households who are vulnerable to COVID-19 and climate change.

Increasing the building stock's energy efficiency is therefore a high priority, and investments by private homeowners will greatly influence this, as around 46.5% of German homes are owner-occupied. To identify the possible monetary benefits of investments in energy retrofits, we investigate whether energy efficiency is reflected in the property values of German single-family homes. Therefore, we examine potential heterogeneous effects across regions. With 422,242 individual observations on a 1 km(2) -grid level from 2014 to 2018, this study adds to the extant literature by 1) examining the energy efficiency effect on housing values for the entire country and specifically investigating regional disparities in this context, and 2) estimating an energy efficiency value-to-cost ratio to compare housing values' increase with initial investment costs and future energy cost savings. Applying hedonic analysis, we find a positive relationship between energy efficiency and asking prices. If energy efficiency increases by 100 kWh/m(2)a, prices increase by 6.9% on average. We also find evidence for regional disparities. The effects are significantly weaker in large cities than in other urban areas, whereas the impact in rural regions is much stronger. According to this, housing shortage and higher purchasing power per capita were identified as drivers for low energy efficiency premiums. Finally, there is evidence that about 98% of future energy cost savings are already reflected in a higher housing value under myopic expectations regarding future energy prices.

TI  - How on Earth Did Spanish Banking Sell the Housing Stock?
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - The accumulation of properties by Spanish banks during the crisis of the first decade of the 21st century has definitely changed the housing market. An optimal house price valuation is useful to determine the bank's actual financial situation. Furthermore, properties valued according to the market can be sold in a shorter span of time and at a better price. Using a sample of 24,781 properties and a simulation exercise, we aim to identify the decision criteria that Spanish banking used to decide which properties were going to be sold and at what price. The results of the comparison among four methods used to value real estate-artificial neural networks, semi log regressions, a combined model by means of weighted least squares regression, and quantile regressions-and the actual situation suggest that banking aimed to maximize the reversal of impairment losses, although this would mean capital losses, selling less properties, and decreasing their revenues. Therefore, the actual combined result was very detrimental to banking and, consequently, to the Spanish society because of its banking bailout.

TI  - People or Systems: Does Productivity Enhancement Matter More than Energy Management in LEED Certified Buildings?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study examines the impact of energy management and productivity-enhancing measures, implemented as part of LEED Existing Buildings Operations and Management (EBOM) certification, on source energy use intensity and rental premiums of office spaces using data on four major US markets. Energy management practices, comprised of commissioning and advanced metering, may reduce energy usage. Conversely, improving air quality and occupant comfort in an effort to increase worker productivity may in turn lead to higher overall energy consumption. The willingness to pay for these features in rental office buildings is hypothesised to depend not only on the extent to which productivity gains enhance the profits of a commercial tenant but also on the lease arrangements for passing any energy savings to the tenant. We apply a difference-in-differences method at a LEED EBOM certification group level and a multi-level modelling approach with a panel data structure. The results indicate that energy management and indoor environment practices have the expected effect on energy consumption as described above. However, the magnitude of the achieved rental premiums appears to be independent of the lease type.

TI  - Area under Rapeseed Cultivation as a Factor Differentiating the Economic Performance of Biodiesel Producers
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the area under rapeseed cultivation on the economic performance and organization of farms. The study was conducted in 164 rapeseed farms in different Polish voivodeships. A targeted sampling procedure was used to select farms for the study. The studied population was divided into four groups depending on area under rapeseed cultivation rates. The selected farms were located in voivodeships with the highest rapeseed acreage rates of the total cropped area. The economic performance of the examined farms improved with increases in rapeseed area. Farms with larger rapeseed areas were characterized by higher production values and better economic performance. On average, the total production value per farm was highest in the group of farms with rapeseed areas of 20.1-30 ha. Similar results were noted when total production values were expressed per ha of arable land, per full-time employee and per man-hour. Total production value was lowest in farms with the smallest rapeseed areas. Farms with the largest areas under rapeseed cultivation achieved the highest farm household income. The farm household income values per full-time employee and per man-hour were highest in farms with the largest areas under rapeseed cultivation. The values of fixed assets and current assets increased with increases in rapeseed area. Most farms were run by owners with secondary school education. The highest percentages of farmers with university education were noted in farms with rapeseed areas of 10-20.1 ha (37.5%) and above 30 ha (30.4%). The vast majority of farms from all groups were run by male farmers. The research results could be useful for policy makers, because they indicate that rapeseed production can not only be profitable but can also be used for biofuel production.

TI  - Positive Energy Districts and Energy Efficiency in Buildings: An Innovative Technical Communication Sheet to Facilitate Policy Officers' Understanding to Enable Technologies and Procedure
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - The Horizon 2020 framework programme is defining funding strategies for research and innovation projects in European cities and promoting policies and solutions for the transition to a competitive energy system at an urban scale. Given that Horizon Europe, thanks to the Driving Urban Transition Partnership, will fund RD&I projects regarding transitions to urban sustainability; how municipalities will implement different strategies is a relevant key to developing replicable models. We conducted this study on Italian cities through a mapping exercise on selected case studies. The aim was to provide a knowledge framework to municipalities undertaking sustainable urban development actions. We selected case studies based on energy efficiency in buildings, both in retrofits and new constructions. This highlighted how the adoption of multifaceted technological solutions blended well with each other, and led, not only, to satisfy the initial requirements, in terms of expected impacts from the single actions, but also provided relevant and replicable samples. For this, the analysis of solutions tested by different municipalities in the selected projects led to spreadsheets and indicators related to energy efficiency in buildings, which enabled a transition to a PED, which could facilitate an understanding of elements that must be clearly indicated in a preliminary design document (Directive 2014/24/UE).

TI  - Buildings' energy performance, green attributes and real estate prices: methodological perspectives from the European literature
T2  - AESTIMUM
AB  - Buildings' energy efficiency may affect real estate prices, but the literature suggests that the effects of green attributes and Energy Performance Certificate ratings on the value of residential properties in Europe are still variable across contexts. The adoption of methods able to appropriately investigate this issue is thus essential. In this framework and to support future studies, this paper offers a methodological review of scientific works on the topic published in the last five years. Our work does not only represent an update of other reviews, but it originally analyses the papers by a methodological viewpoint. Results highlight a progressive refinement of the research questions and methods adopted. Then, the increasing importance of concepts such as latent variables and green attributes in the real estate pricing process is detected and identified as a field to be furtherly explored. Finally, Structural Equation Modelling is proposed as a promising approach for future studies.

TI  - Smart Thermostats in Rental Housing Units: Perspectives from Landlords and Tenants
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Rental properties make up approximately 37% of the US residential building stock and are responsible for 23% of the total energy consumption in this sector. Although this market has great potential for energy efficiency, the implementation of energy savings measures in this market faces numerous challenges. In particular, one of the main challenges cited is the split incentive, limiting the potential motivation of rental property owners and tenants to invest in energy-efficient technologies. Smart thermostats have gained substantial interest and adoption in the past decade and have been the subject of numerous studies. However, their adoption and use in the context of the rental housing market has not been considered. In this study, reviews posted on an online retailer's website (Amazon) were used as an unstructured source of information to evaluate the attitudes of landlords and tenants toward smart thermostats. In total, 31,790 reviews were collected for 14 commercially available smart thermostats; from these, 173 reviews were identified as directly associated with rental units. These selected reviews were then analyzed and categorized based on the unique opportunities and challenges that were expressed. The majority of reviewers focused on usability aspects and expressed an interest in the advanced remote-control functions of their purchased devices. Furthermore, our findings indicated that occupancy pattern learning capabilities were not of particular interest among this user group. These findings can inform product manufacturers and policy makers in their future interactions with stakeholders in the rental housing market and potentially increase adoption and hence energy efficiency.

TI  - Do solar panels increase housing rents in Australia?
T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - Greater uptake of solar panels on rental housing would have implications for housing affordability and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The influence of energy investments on housing values has been widely studied, with past research often finding a positive relationship. However, there is missing knowledge for the specific relationship between solar panels and housing rents. This study finds that Australian renters with solar panels pay approximately A$19 more in weekly housing rents than non-solar renters. The results suggest that landlords have been able to benefit from investments in solar panels through higher rent, with a payback period of around 5 years. The study provides context for policymakers across the world considering subsidies for solar panels on rental housing. The findings are robust across multiple methods including entropy balancing and are based on two large Australian household surveys.

TI  - Household acceptability of energy efficiency policies in the European Union: Policy characteristics trade-offs and the role of trust in government and environmental identity
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This research investigates the acceptability of energy efficiency policies among European households. Based on large-scale surveys in Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK, we use a discrete choice experiment to study the trade-offs made by households between various policy characteristics including policy target level, dependence on energy imports, policy instruments (education and information programmes, standards, taxation, energy consumption limit), costs to the household, and distribution of costs between households and other sectors. In particular, we investigate the role of trust in government and of environmental identity on the acceptability of these policy characteristics. Across the four countries, we find that households prefer effective policies, dislike personal costs, and prefer non-coercive to coercive instruments; further, trust in government helps make coercive policies such as taxes more acceptable, whereas higher environmental identity makes consumption limits more acceptable.

TI  - The optimal subsidy scheme and technology innovation strategy considering consumers' green premium
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS
AB  - Purpose This paper investigates how a regulator pursuing social welfare maximization designs an optimal subsidy scheme to stimulate technology innovation in the presence of a consumer green premium. Specifically, the authors solve the following questions: (1) Does the consumers' green premium affect the design of the subsidy scheme? (2) How should the firm choose a green technology innovation strategy under the optimal subsidy scheme? (3) Does technology innovation bring higher social welfare and lower environmental impact? Design/methodology/approach The authors first develop a game model to explore the impact of subsidy schemes on social welfare without considering technology innovation. Then the authors investigate two innovation strategies, in-house innovation and external introduction, under the optimal subsidy scheme. Finally, they illustrate the optimal choices of innovation strategy for the firm, consumers and regulators. Findings The results reveal that the subsidy scheme will not always increase social welfare, which depends on the environmental improvement coefficient of the unit green level. The optimal subsidy level increases with the green premium, but it is not related to the size of the consumer green segment. Moreover, the success rate of in-house innovation will raise the optimal green level, but the company benefits from an increased success rate of in-house innovation only when the green segment is large enough. The green segment size and external green level jointly determine the choice of technology innovation strategy. Originality/value This research is the first to analyze this problem while considering the green demand and subsidy scheme simultaneously as drivers of a firm's technology innovation, thereby providing new managerial implications for decisions by the regulator and firms.

TI  - Engaging UK repair-maintain-improve practitioners in improved building performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION
AB  - Purpose To improve building performance and meet statutory carbon reduction targets, a radical transformation of existing UK building stock is needed. Much previous research on building performance has focussed on large-scale construction. However, retrofit of existing housing stock - which will contribute the majority of the requisite efficiency improvement - is carried out by practitioners in the repair-maintain-improve (RMI) subsector. These practitioners are the sole traders and micro-firms who constitute two-fifths of employment in the construction sector. The study aims to examine the factors influencing these practitioners in RMI work to understand how better to engage them with improved building performance. Design/methodology/approach A total of 31 semi-structured interviews were conducted with RMI professionals from around the UK and analysed using template analysis. Findings The analysis identified capabilities of the practitioners who influence building performance, including knowledge and co-ordination of people and resources; opportunities including state action and customer demand; and motivations including pride in work, customer care and satisfaction, maintaining a viable business and working relationships. Research limitations/implications The participants were a small, mixed group in terms of firm size and specialisation. The qualitative approach adopted provided detailed insights but does not make claims for statistical generalisability or representativeness of the findings. Future work could look to extend the findings with a statistically representative survey. Practical implications For a successful transition to high standards of building performance, modelling is not enough. Initiatives are needed to address the multiple factors which determine engagement in energy-efficient retrofit: capacities, opportunities and motivations. The desire of RMI practitioners to meet customer expectations could be used to develop pragmatic building performance evaluation, guided by householder satisfaction criteria. Originality/value The study examined the attitudes and experiences of an under-researched sector who are essential to the delivery of improved building performance. This study makes a novel contribution by applying an established psychological model of behaviour change, the capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour model, for the first time in this domain.

TI  - The Willingness to Pay for Residential PV Plants in Italy: A Discrete Choice Experiment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - PV energy generates economic and environmental benefits (e.g., energy cost-saving, GHG emissions reduction, etc.), which can be capitalized into market prices. There is, therefore, growing interest in assessing the value that PV systems add to solar homes (i.e., homes equipped with PV production plants) market prices. Although the number of solar homes has experienced rapid growth in Europe and Italy, literature investigating the impact of PV power plants on home values is still very limited. This paper aims to fill this gap. We implement a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) approach to estimate individuals' WTP for different typologies of domestic PV plants, which vary in technical characteristics. Our findings show that homebuyers are willing to pay a price premium for solar homes, ranging from some 3% to some 15%, depending on PV panels' characteristics. These results can provide a wealth of recommendations to different interested parties such as homeowners, homebuyers, realtors, and governments, seeking knowledge on the capitalization effect of residential PV plants on the housing market to implement cost-effective investment strategies or design optimal policy incentives.

TI  - A study on automated property management in commercial real estate: a case of India
T2  - PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose Property management in commercial real estate (CRE) is an important operational function that needs to be managed because it brings large cost implications to the organization. As India aspires to become a developed real estate market, analysis of the growing importance of automating property services and technology acceptance by stakeholders are two key concerns that need to be explicitly addressed. This study aims to examine the extent of property technology (PropTech) adoption in India and propose a technology-enabled stakeholder management model in Indian CRE. Design/methodology/approach The research is qualitative in nature and follows the grounded theory approach. Research data were collected by conducting a series of semi-structured interviews with 18 property management professionals from different prominent Indian companies using PropTech. Findings The findings suggested the nine most typical automated property management functions in Indian CRE. The result of this research is the automated property services model for stakeholder management in CRE. The model demonstrates the value of implementing technology in property services in India. Practical implications The study provides useful insights into how artificial intelligence (AI) in property management can be applied to address property-related challenges, various stakeholder needs and improve property performance in accordance with energy efficiency policies. Originality/value This paper attempts to add to the limited body of literature on technology in the property management domain. The model demonstrates how automated property services meet the needs of different stakeholders in CRE and provides remote working procedures within the COVID-19 pandemic context.

TI  - How to make building renovation work for low-income renters: Preferences for distributional principles and procedural options in Austria
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Widespread thermal refurbishment of existing buildings is essential for mitigating carbon emissions and energy poverty. Retrofitting for better energy efficiency in low-income rental housing comes up against the tenant-landlord dilemma, however; for renovation to be accepted by residents, rules for cost sharing and fair implementation are required. The present study employs structural equation modelling to analyse distributional and procedural preferences in a survey sample of 942 social welfare recipients in Austria. The distributional principles of polluter-pays and energy bill neutrality are preferred for allocating renovation costs. Equal-pay, ability-to-pay, and paying extra instalments to finance the renovation are only accepted for buildings in high need of renovation. Low-income renters welcome a wide range of procedural options, in particular, providing transparent and comprehensive information on the planned renovation and mitigating inconvenience during the construction phase. Psychological and relational capabilities play into these preferences: households holding proenvironmental attitudes favour polluter-pays to prevent free-riders. A frugal mindset, trust in the landlord and renter concerns make low-income renters endorse ability-to-pay to avoid being displaced to lower-grade dwellings on a discriminating housing market. The results suggest that distributional principles need not stand alone but could be combined. For instance, allocating the majority of renovation costs by polluter-pays, but a smaller share by ability-to-pay, may cushion disproportionate impacts on less affluent residents. Energy counselling could empower low-income renters to manage personal energy and renovation costs, and to build literacy about renovation benefits and legal claims to encourage their landlord to renovate.

TI  - Context and meaningfulness in energy efficiency labeling: Real estate listings
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Research on heuristics and energy labels shows that the decision context and the meaningfulness of energy information can affect decision-making. In this experiment, we test whether home energy labels that differ in how they present context information about energy savings, and whether those labels include energy cost information that matters to consumers, differ in their ability to influence home buying decisions. A simulated real estate website used by a national sample of U.S. home buyers (N = 1538) shows that energy efficiency labels with more salient context information can more effectively encourage selection of efficient homes. The mock website experimentally tested energy labels with varying levels of context information and employed a disguised discrete choice task as the dependent variable. Using home buyers' clicking behavior on the mock website, we calculated the likelihood of clicking on efficient listings and willingness to increase purchase price for efficiency. Presenting efficiency as a score along a line provided the most salient context information of all labels. It was also the most effective method of encouraging home buyers to select efficient listings and place a high monetary value on efficiency. Presenting efficiency information for only the most efficient homes (voluntary labelling) reduced the amount of context information available to consumers and was least effective at encouraging selection of efficient homes. Energy cost information in energy labels was only moderately effective in this experiment, possibly because of unintended context effects. Results demonstrate the importance of context information in labels as well as the importance of heuristics such as the anchoring heuristic.

TI  - Digitalization in Buildings and Smart Cities on the Way to 6G
T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - The energy turnaround created a high volatility in the energy production based on renewable energy. To integrate renewable energy economically in buildings and smart cities an additional concept of energy storage and energy supply based on energy management concepts must be claimed. The political views have changed during the last years and energy efficiency in buildings is seen important because 35% of greenhouse gas is produced by the final energy consumption. The deployment of local energy production concepts is an important step to energy turnaround. To generate and distribute energy effectively in buildings, digital components such as sensors, actuators, meters, and energy management systems must be installed in the buildings and the digital components must be able to communicate via communication networks. The paper describes systems for local energy generation, necessary communication networks for buildings and smart cities and digitization applications in industrial buildings. As an example of energy management, the Oktett64 system is presented, which is based on Enterprise IT technology and has implemented AI and blockchain technology. Digitalization with platforms such as Oktett64 are based on technologies that are superior to today's often commercially available Programmable Logic Controllers. The article also shows how the future mobile communications standards 5G beyond and 6G can offer special solutions for the digitization of buildings in their edge clouds.

TI  - Is investing in energy efficiency worth it? Evidence for substantial price premiums but limited profitability in the housing sector
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The profitability of investing in building energy efficiency is investigated using distinct approaches. Firstly, a spatial autoregressive model is applied to housing price data in Padua, North-eastern Italy, and compared to a traditional hedonic price model in order to estimate the price premium if anycommanded by the energy performance. The spatial dynamic model outperforms the hedonic one. In comparison to the energy rating band G, substantial price premiums are found to characterize the A-B bands and, to a lesser extent, the C-D bands. Secondly, the marginal benefit of building energy efficiency is derived from the price premium and compared to the marginal cost as estimated in previous studies. Investing in building energy efficiency turns out to be economically viable up to a certain extent. Outdated housing in the worst energy rating bands can be profitably refurbished up to an energy performance index of about 50 kWh/m(2) y namely, the B energy rating band on average. The same outdated housing can be profitably refurbished up to an energy performance index of about 40 kWh/m(2) y provided the government does not withdraw current tax incentives in the near future.

Climate change and rising energy costs are likely to accentuate EP. This study extends our knowledge about EP in Australia and examines its relationship to housing and health. Drawing on 23 semi-structured interviews, we map the impacts of EP on older low-income people residing in Sydney and Melbourne. These impacts include food insecurity, an incapacity to purchase essential consumer items, an inability to afford required medical procedures, thermal discomfort and social exclusion. We found that many interviewees do not recognize their own EP situation or are too ashamed to ask for help. Thus, the overall cost of EP to individuals and the broader society can be far higher than what statistics indicate. The article proposes a conceptualization of the relationship between housing, health and EP drawing on a figure we have created. The severe impacts of EP suggest that measures to lessen it among older vulnerable households are urgently required.

TI  - Energy, emissions and economic impact of the new nZEB regulatory framework on residential buildings renovation: Case study in southern Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - Spanish residential buildings built in the decade of the housing bubble (2000-2009) had to comply with the Basic Buildings Standard on thermal conditions in buildings. At the end of this period, the Basic Energy Savings Document of the Technical Building Code published in the Royal Decree 314/2006, transposing European Directive 2002/91/EC, entered into force. Recently, this regulatory framework has been updated by the Royal Decree 732/2019, which transposes European Directives 2010/31/EU, 2012/27/EU and 2018/844/EU. A case study is used to analyse the energy, emissions and economic impact of these regulatory changes on an attached house located in all municipalities of Andalusia (South of Spain). The thermal behaviour of this house is compared with the one adapted to the new regulations. The TRNSYS transient system simulation tool is used for the energy study. The house adaptation is carried out by partially modifying the envelope, including a solarthermal contribution to domestic hot water supply, and photovoltaic energy production to reduce electricity consumption. The results showed that the European objectives are greatly exceeded. Energy savings range from 69% to 127%, carbon dioxide emissions decrease by 65%-118%, and energy bills are reduced from 71% to 125%.

TI  - Identifying optimal renovation schedules for building portfolios: Application in a social housing context under multi-year funding constraints
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Identifying optimal refurbishment strategies for a building stock is a challenging task. Numerous energy efficiency measures can be undertaken for each building. In addition, under financial constraints, real estate owners have to decide in which buildings and renovation actions to invest first, as well as how to plan renovations over time. A methodology combining multi-objective optimisation (MOO) with dynamic building energy simulation is proposed to help building stock managers to set their priorities. The MOO is based on the NSGA-II algorithm: a first chromosome represents the possible buildings and the actions to invest in, while a second chromosome corresponds to the temporal sequencing of these retrofit choices. Finally, optimal refurbishment schedules can be identified. The methodology is applied to multi-dwelling units of a portfolio property owner in Greater Paris Area. Refurbishment schedules, minimising investment cost and energy consumption, and meeting yearly budget constraints, were analysed. Among optimal schedules, actions that are frequently selected on a building during the first few years of renovation are identified as priorities. The developed methodology, implemented in a tool, thus provides a first level of decision aid.

TI  - A Methodological Proposal for the Analysis of Lighting the House Building Facades
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
AB  - Natural lighting is a fundamental element in the habitability of dwellings. However, it is still difficult to calculate its effect on the facades of the buildings in detail, due to the morphological complexity of the property itself, as well as the environment that surrounds it. This study provides a methodological proposal that uses pre-existing open data to extrude buildings by using a GIS procedure. Based on three selected real estate properties with different characteristics in the city of Marbella (Spain), the hours of sunlight received by each building's facade are calculated, taking into account the digital land model and the digital surface model of the area. The results confirm the usefulness of the method to measure and analyze differences in luminosity between buildings with similar urban characteristics and their surroundings, as well as to record the differences in luminosity between floors and the orientations of the same building at several heights. The methodological proposal opens a path for many applications related to energy efficiency, housing conditions, and property valuation.

TI  - Wooden Additional Floors in Old Apartment Buildings: Perspectives of Housing and Real Estate Companies from Finland
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - This paper examined various stages and advantages of wooden additional floors from the perspective of Finnish housing and real estate companies through interviews with professionals involved in these projects. Main findings highlighted: (1) commercial conditions should be carefully analyzed for return on investment; (2) city plan change and the presence of a potential contractor and an expert were generally considered important issues; (3) considerations regarding city planning, parking spaces, load-carrying capacity, and new building codes were highlighted as critical factors for feasibility study; (4) existing building regulations and building rights regarding the subscription fee and tax issues should be considered during project planning; (5) city plan change and building rights with different tendering conditions were reported as important parameters in implementation planning; (6) an efficient flow of information between the parties involved was vital to the successful progress of the construction phase. Wooden additional floor construction, which requires commitment, investment, and cooperation between interested parties, has great potential regarding construction technology and contracting mechanisms. Additionally, this sustainable approach has many advantages concerning the environment, economy, energy efficiency, and aesthetics. In this sense, it is believed that this study will contribute to the diffusion of wooden additional floor construction in other countries besides Finland.

TI  - Analysis of Professionals' and the General Public's Perceptions of Passive Houses in Korea: Needs Assessment for the Improvement of the Energy Efficiency and Indoor Environmental Quality
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Despite the economic and environmental benefits of passive houses, their market penetration has been low, which is partially due to misperceptions regarding their cost. This study examined the perceptions of building-related professionals and the general public regarding Korean passive houses to explore strategies for spurring passive house concepts and practices. The participants took an online survey on their interest in and reasons to reside in passive houses and their expected construction costs. The results from two separate groups of participants, including 162 professionals and 130 members of the general public, were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Both the professional and general public groups expressed a strong interest in passive houses because of the comfortable and healthy indoor environment, energy efficiency, cost savings, and sustainability that they provide. However, the expected construction costs of passive houses were perceived differently by the two groups: They were believed to be less expensive by the professionals and more expensive by the public respondents. This difference seems to result from their prior knowledge or experience regarding passive houses. Both groups were willing to pay more and assumed that the high expected costs were related to the construction products, systems, and labor costs of passive houses. The results showed that the lack of information or education on passive houses could be a major barrier to accessing passive houses, especially with the general public, while the cost could pose less of a barrier to the overall growth of the Korean passive house market. Further efforts by the government and industry are needed in order to provide more educational programs and to identify and manufacture more reasonably priced construction materials.

TI  - Measurement of the direct rebound effect of residential electricity consumption: An empirical study based on the China family panel studies
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - The rebound effect is a potential threat to energy efficiency related policies to save energy. Based on data from China family panel studies over the period 2010-2018, this paper measures the energy efficiency and direct rebound effect of residential electricity consumption by using the stochastic energy demand frontier model. The result shows that the average value of efficiency is 0.491, and the average rebound effect is 48%. It means that there is still room for improvement in China's household electricity consumption efficiency. But the expected electricity- saving after improving efficiency can only achieve 52%. Besides, we find that electricity price and household size have a negative impact on the rebound effect, while the impact of income is inverted U-shaped. Finally, the rebound effect varies between before and after the implementation of the increasing block pricing policy, considering rural and urban residents and different regions. These findings provide some policy implications for the residential electricity pricing system under the background of energy conservation and climate change.

TI  - The spatial uneven difussion of energy-efficiency transparency policy. An analysis of the multi-family market in Barcelona
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - In order to foster energy-informed real estate decisions, the EU has universalised the energy performance certificates to be displayed on advertising for sale and rental. However, in Spain, such certificates are absent in a disturbing proportion of cases. This paper investigates the prevalence of this problem, its spatial patterns, and the concomitant architectonic and locative attributes. In doing so, data from 49,000 apartments listed for leasing and renting in Metropolitan Barcelona are analysed using conventional and spatial econometric methods. The results suggest that the probability that a listing includes the energy rating of the dwelling largely depends on other neighbouring listings. Furthermore, the information opacity exists for the worst dwellings, which are expected to be the most inefficient, located in areas inhabited by low-income population. That is, the population that could benefit the most from this policy is, precisely, the most uninformed.

TI  - Different grades and different green premiums: a cross sectional analysis of a green certification scheme
T2  - PACIFIC RIM PROPERTY RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB  - Green certification is often hailed as an effective means of resolving information asymmetry by providing prospective buyers with credible proof of a property's level of quantitative sustainability performance. These certification schemes are also considered as providing the credible identification labels needed to generate a market premium. This study analysed whether different market premiums (financial implications) exist across different ratings of the HK-BEAM certification scheme. The paper used hedonic price model (HPM) to evaluate the influence of green certification rating levels on residential property prices in Hong Kong. The results indicate, on average, that HK-BEAM certification increases price values by between 5.3% and 6.7%. Most importantly, the results indicate that significant price premium differences exist across the different ratings available for HK-BEAM certified buildings. The findings provide strong proof of the existence of a premium across ratings.

TI  - Impacts on Indoor Thermal Comfort and Heating Energy Use in Hellenic Dwellings from Occupant Behavioral Reactions
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - In an effort to reduce the operational cost of their dwellings, occupants may even have to sacrifice their indoor thermal comfort conditions. Following the economic recession in Greece over recent years, homeowners have been forced to adapt their practices by shortening heating hours, lowering the indoor thermostat settings, isolating spaces that are not heated or even turning off their central heating system and using alternative local heating systems. This paper presents the results from over 100 occupant surveys using questionnaires and walk-through energy audits in Hellenic households that documented how occupants operated the heating systems in their dwellings and the resulting indoor thermal comfort conditions and actual energy use. The results indicate that the perceived winter thermal comfort conditions were satisfactory in only half of the dwellings, since the actual operating space heating periods averaged only 5 h (compared with the assumed 18 h in standard conditions), while less than half heated their entire dwellings and only a fifth maintained an indoor setpoint temperature of 20 degrees C, corresponding to standard comfort conditions. Mainstream energy conservation measures include system maintenance, switching to more efficient systems, reducing heat losses and installing controls. This information is then used to derive empirical adaptation factors for bridging the gap between the calculated and actual energy use, making more realistic estimates of the expected energy savings following building renovations, setting prudent targets for energy efficiency and developing effective plans toward a decarbonized building stock.

TI  - The merits of making energy costs visible: The sustainability benefits of monetizing energy efficiency certificates in Spanish rental homes
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Reducing energy consumption in the building sector is a priority issue in European policy. The aim of legislation on energy certification is to provide incentives for the energy renovation of buildings. To help achieve this goal, a methodology is proposed to provide information on the economic cost of the energy bill, in addition to the current indicators of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. By applying this methodology, it can be seen that energy costs account for between 5% and 62% of the price of renting a house in Spain. Making this information available to the consumers would have a direct impact on rental prices. The landlords/landladies who carry out the energy renovation of their home could charge a higher rent, which would allow them to recover the investment made. Also, tenants of homes with more expensive energy bills would benefit from having their rent reduced. Landlords/landladies who renovate their home and tenants who access a home without energy renovation would benefit from making energy costs visible. This simple legislative measure would help to overcome the added difficulty that owners of rental homes have - they pay for the energy renovation while the tenants enjoy the savings after the improvement of the property. With a minimum of additional effort, a significant impact on an important issue could be achieved.

TI  - Implementing the Integrated Design Process (IDP) to design, construct and monitor an eco-house in hot climate
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE ENGINEERING
AB  - Eco-houses play a pivotal role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To implement such a concept, the current Conventional Design Process (CDP) needs to be improved. Thus, Integrated Design Process (IDP) was recently introduced to the buildings sector. IDP involves early stakeholders in a systematic approach to achieve performance targets. In this study, IDP was implemented in a single-family house, targeting efficient houses with minimum/no cost. Many energy efficiency strategies (EESs), such as envelop insulation, orientation, window properties, and efficient air-conditioning system, have been applied. These energy strategies predicted a substantial energy reduction where the energy use intensity (EUI) would fall from 182 to 72 kWh/m(2).year. In addition, solar renewable energy, domestic solar hot water (DSHW), and photovoltaic (PV) panels (10 kW) saved 18.78 MWh/year. Besides, water efficiency strategies (WESs) are anticipated to save 217,581 gallons/year due to the use of a water recycling unit, low flowrate faucets, and efficient shower systems, all of which have been proposed. All the recommended energy efficiency strategies (EESs) and water efficiency strategies (WESs) had a simple payback period of fewer than 10 years and proved their cost feasibility over their life-cycle. Moreover, a considerable CO2 emission avoidance (117 tons/year) was attained.

TI  - Correlation between simulations and measurements of an eco-house design for Mongolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - Mongolia is experiencing unprecedented urbanization along with recent economic growth. Ulaanbaatar is known to be the coldest capital in the world and heating demand is very high during the long winter season. Due to the increase of coal burning to provide heat, there is an urgent need to improve housing and to reduce energy use and air pollution. Currently, there is a revitalization of the Ger area of Mongolia and this presents a good opportunity to redevelop the region into an ecologically designed district with sustainable housing. Such a redesign will result in energy saving and air pollution reduction. With this goal in mind, a pilot project called Create Accord Living Environment (CALE), was developed to demonstrate living conditions with a new house design that is cost effective for Mongolia. This paper presents the house performance using an energy simulation and the results are correlated with measurement data taken during the wintertime. The average energy use intensity (EUI) for 5 CALE houses was found to be 112 kWh/m(2)/yr. This is a 71% energy savings compared to a typical detached house with a modern and efficient house design. If it is possible to redevelop 1000 houses in the Ger area, an estimated 6.5 kton/yr in carbon emission can be saved. In addition, a parametric study was conducted to investigate the impact of different construction materials, craftsmanship quality, and occupants' behavior on the house's energy efficiency. The proposed housing structures, which provide a comfortable living space with significantly reduced energy utilization, serves as a potential model for development both within Mongolia as well as for other similar climates.

TI  - A Life Cycle Cost Analysis of Structural Insulated Panels for Residential Buildings in a Hot and Arid Climate
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - In hot and humid climatic conditions, cooling tends to dominate building thermal energy use. Cooling loads can be reduced through the adoption of efficient building envelope materials, such as Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs). This study quantifies the life cycle cost and operational energy of a representative case-study house in Bahrain using SIPs and hollow concrete blocks (HCBs) for the envelope over a period of 50 years. Operational energy is calculated using a dynamic energy simulation tool, operational costs are calculated based on the energy demand and local tariff rates, and construction costs are estimated using market prices and quotations. The life cycle cost is quantified using the Net Present Cost technique. Results show that SIPs yield a 20.6% reduction in cooling energy use compared to HCBs. For SIP costs of 12 and 17 USD/m(2), the SIP house was cheaper throughout, or had a higher capital cost than the HCB house (breaking even in year 33), respectively. We propose policy recommendations with respect to material pricing, electricity tariffs, and energy efficiency, to improve the operational energy efficiency of houses in Bahrain and similar countries along the Arabian Peninsula.

TI  - Digital Twin-Driven Decision Making and Planning for Energy Consumption
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionising how energy is delivered from energy producers and used throughout residential households. Optimising the residential energy consumption is a crucial step toward having greener and sustainable energy production. Such optimisation requires a household-centric energy management system as opposed to a one-rule-fits all approach. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-layer digital twin of the energy system that aims to mirror households' actual energy consumption in the form of a household digital twin (HDT). When linked to the energy production digital twin (EDT), HDT empowers the household-centric energy optimisation model to achieve the desired efficiency in energy use. The model intends to improve the efficiency of energy production by flattening the daily energy demand levels. This is done by collaboratively reorganising the energy consumption patterns of residential homes to avoid peak demands whilst accommodating the resident needs and reducing their energy costs. Indeed, our system incorporates the first HDT model to gauge the impact of various modifications on the household energy bill and, subsequently, on energy production. The proposed energy system is applied to a real-world IoT dataset that spans over two years and covers seventeen households. Our conducted experiments show that the model effectively flattened the collective energy demand by 20.9% on synthetic data and 20.4% on a real dataset. At the same time, the average energy cost per household was reduced by 10.7% for the synthetic data and 17.7% for the real dataset.

TI  - Should energy efficiency subsidies be tied into housing prices?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Heat pumps are a key technology for improving energy efficiency as they can significantly reduce energy costs and emissions. Given the significant role of heat pumps in carbon neutrality pathways, and pressure for related national energy efficiency programs, it is important to examine economic profitability of heat pump investments and their relative environmental and social benefits. This paper aims to answer the following main research question: are areas with lower housing prices and income less likely to invest into energy efficiency? The paper finds that in Finland heat pumps are already very profitable and converting buildings' heating systems into heat pumps creates major environmental and economic benefits for the residents. The cost of heating and heat pump investment costs does not vary between locations whereas housing prices, rents and income do. Neighborhoods with lower housing prices have less motivation and capability to invest into heat pumps. Urban areas with positive housing price development, higher income and better financing options will likely invest into energy efficiency without subsidies. Potential subsidies should be allocated into areas with lower housing prices, because emissions are evenly distributed, and lower income areas pay relatively more for energy. Energy efficiency subsidies could be tied into housing prices or more specifically into property tax, which is universally collected in most countries. Property tax could be used to guide energy efficiency investments into locations where they would not be carried out otherwise. For areas that do not need subsidies, this paper recommends that awareness should be increased, because the economic and carbon emission reduction potential of energy efficiency measures is still not well understood.

TI  - Can different approaches to funding household energy efficiency deliver on economic and social policy objectives? ECO and alternatives in the UK
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Residential energy efficiency is a core element of the decarbonisation policy in many nations. In the UK, the established approach to enabling efficiency gains through centralised retrofitting programmes involves socialising costs via consumer energy bills through the Energy Company Obligation (ECO). One UK policy concern is whether less affluent households should receive greater access to ECO funding. However, there is a broader concern that the use of constrained public resources should be justified through wider and sustained economic returns emerging. Here, we consider the (centralised) ECO approach to cost recovery alongside alternative (decentralised) approaches to delivering energy efficiency programmes that either pass costs to beneficiary households or fully socialise costs via income tax. We find the key drivers of both household and wider economy outcomes are the absolute levels of resources actually devoted to enabling efficiency gains and household disposable income freed up to power expansionary processes. The latter in particular brings challenges and tradeoffs in terms of meeting both economic performance and social policy objectives, given that resources targeted at higher income households can ultimately free up more real spending ability and sustain greater gains in GDP, employment and household incomes.

TI  - Buildings' Energy Efficiency and the Probability of Mortgage Default: The Dutch Case
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
AB  - We investigate the relationship between building energy efficiency and the probability of mortgage default. To this end, we construct a novel panel data set by combining Dutch loan-level mortgage information with provisional building energy ratings provided by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency. Using the logit regression and the extended Cox model, we find that building energy efficiency is associated with a lower probability of mortgage default. There are three possible channels that might drive the results: (i) personal borrower characteristics captured by the choice of an energy-efficient building, (ii) improvements in building performance that could help to free-up the borrower's disposable income, and (iii) improvements in dwelling value that lower the loan-to-value ratio. We address all three channels. In particular, we find that the default rate is lower for borrowers with less disposable income. The results hold for a battery of robustness checks. This suggests that the energy efficiency ratings complement borrowers' credit information and that a lender using information from both sources can make superior lending decisions than a lender using only traditional credit information. These aspects are not only crucial for shaping future energy policy, but also have implications for the risk management of European financial institutions.

TI  - Impact of home energy efficiency labeling program on housing decisions in South Korea: A choice experiment approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The South Korean government has been providing information on home energy efficiency since 2001 in order to incentivize improvements in the energy efficiency of both existing and new buildings. Whether such information provision delivers the intended outcomes hinges on consumers' preferences for home energy efficiency in the real estate market. This study investigates South Korean consumers' preferences for home energy efficiency in the real estate market by applying a choice experiment approach. Using a conditional logit model and a latent class model, this study concludes that less than 20% of Korean consumers consider home energy efficiency as a significant factor in their housing decisions and identifies the sources of taste variations in Korean consumers' preferences for home energy efficiency. The findings of this study imply that the current information programs on home energy efficiency in South Korea should be much improved to achieve its goal.

TI  - The magnitude of "all-inclusive energy packages" in the UK student housing sector
T2  - AREA
AB  - With the growing number of students in higher education, the student housing market has been becoming increasingly competitive and diversified. This intensification has led housing providers to supply all-inclusive energy packages (i.e., the inclusion of electricity, gas, and water in the rent cost) to their tenants as a selling point. By connecting the geographies of students and energy, this paper aims to assess the magnitude of all-inclusive energy packages and its effects on students' residential choices. Based on an online survey distributed to students at Loughborough University (UK), the paper shows that 80% of housing occupied by students is energy-inclusive. These rental commodities are strongly considered by students, particularly new university entrants, in their housing choices, 70% of whom considered all-inclusive rent to be an important factor in their residential choice. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that all-inclusive energy packages are extensively provided throughout the student housing market: from the low-energy efficient houses in multiple occupancy to the newly developed purpose-built student accommodation. Finally, the paper underpins how providing energy-inclusive rent tends to produce energy inequities by shielding some students from being in fuel poverty.

TI  - Housing market segmentation and the price effect of certified green residential properties
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - One important yet overlooked theme in the literature regarding green building certifications (GBC) is the latent differences in pricing behaviors among property buyers in different housing market segments. Specifically, are buyers in the mass housing market willing to pay larger premiums (in terms of the % above average prices) for properties in certified buildings than buyers in the luxury market? This question is particularly crucial for highrise environments in which properties belonging to different housing sub-markets are within the same building. This, in turn, could have profound implications for the availability of housing flats of varying sizes in certified green residential buildings. This study, therefore, explores this issue by comparing price premiums, if any, for living space in buildings certified with several green building certifications in the two housing sub-markets in Hong Kong. Utilizing a sample of over 220,000 transactions, the main finding is that buyers in the mass housing market were generally willing to pay larger price premiums for properties in certified buildings than buyers in the luxury housing market, unless the certification represented noticeable and actual (not simulated) improvements in the overall environmental performance or energy performance. Implications for different stakeholders are then discussed based on the findings.

TI  - Beyond technology adoption: Examining home energy management systems, energy burdens and climate change perceptions during COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed our lives. While the global impacts of the pandemic are shocking, the implications for energy burdens, climate policy, and energy efficiency are salient. This study examines income differences in the acceptance of and willingness to pay for home energy management systems during the COVID-19 pandemic among 632 residents in New York. Additionally, this study examines energy profiles, energy burdens, climate change issues, risk perceptions, and social-psychological factors. Compared with low-income households, our findings suggest that high-income households use more energy, have higher utility bills during quarantine mandates, perceive a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, and perceive climate change issues to be better than before. Low-income households, however, experience the highest energy burdens. Regarding HEMS acceptance, high-income households are more willing to adopt energy and well-being-promoting features of HEMS and more willing to pay a higher monthly fee for all the features than other income groups. Overall, participants were more willing to pay a higher price for the energy features than the well-being-promoting features. Low-income households indicate lower social norms, personal norms, and perceived behavioral control over adopting HEMS; they also perceive HEMS to be more difficult to use and less useful. Higher-income households express a higher trust in utilities than low-income households. Surprisingly, cost concerns, technology anxiety, and cybersecurity concerns relating to HEMS do not differ across income groups. This paper addresses the interactions among technology attributes and social-psychological and demographic factors, and provides policy implications and insights for future research.

TI  - Dwellers' perception on challenges and motivators of greening existing buildings in Brunei Darussalam
T2  - BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose Greening existing buildings (GEB) considerably improves energy efficiency of old buildings, along with other benefits, but it is not widely practiced. As a part of a wider study, this paper aims to evaluate the perception of building dwellers/owners on the challenges and motivators to GEB in Brunei Darussalam. Design/methodology/approach A structured questionnaire survey collected 109 responses from building owners/dwellers. Cronbach's alpha tested the reliability of the data collected. One-sample t-test examined if sample means are consistent with population means. ANOVA examined if different respondent groups significantly agreed on the importance levels of individual factors. Moreover, factor analysis narrowed down the long list of factors in to a smaller number of components. Findings A set of 30 challenges and 19 motivators of GEB was identified. "Lack of a GEB infrastructure" was identified as the collective key challenge, leading dwellers to recognize lack of support and knowledge and develop wrong perception on GEB. However, "framework of supports," as a summative motivator, improves knowledge and awareness on GEB, which allows recognizing other benefits and developing a momentum of practicing GEB. Factor analysis suggested a consolidated approach for challenges through six interrelated components, but for motivators to focus on somewhat four independent areas. Originality/value House/building dweller/owners' decision is the key to undertake GEB. This study, apparently for the first time, contributes to identifying the challenges and motivators that influence their decision-making.

TI  - New step-by-step retrofitting model for delivering optimum timing
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - Although the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive 2018/844/EU introduced the building renovation passport and by such proposed to consider step-by-step renovation, a literature review could not identify any explicit step-by-step retrofitting optimisation model. Therefore, the present study seeks to explore the following research questions: which indications regarding the optimum timing of renovation steps can a net present value maximising model deliver; how are model?s results impacted by the interdependency of renovation steps and by homeowner?s budget restrictions. The model relies on three pillars: homeowners? budget restrictions; building material ageing processes; and interdependency between the retrofitting steps. Implemented as a mixed-integer linear program, it maximises the net present value of households? energy-related cash flows, and delivers the optimum timing when each step should be performed. As input data, five real-life building renovation roadmaps were used. The appropriate metric to assess building?s retrofitting energy savings is also discussed. When comparing both single-step and step-by-step approaches, the step-by-step presented 11?22% higher cumulated energy savings. Results also show that a renovation period would last between 1 and 14 years and 2 to 11 years, depending on whether interdependency of measures is considered. This has direct implications on the improvement of building stocks? energy efficiency, and consequently, the achievement of decarbonisation targets set for 2050. In this context, the model delivers a more concrete time horizon perspective in regards to the achievement of these targets. Future work will include quantifying the economic effects of interdependency of steps and expanding the analysis for varies techno-economic building typologies.

TI  - EPC Labels and Building Features: Spatial Implications over Housing Prices
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The influence of building or dwelling energy performance on the real estate market dynamics and pricing processes is deeply explored, due to the fact that energy efficiency improvement is one of the fundamental reasons for retrofitting the existing housing stock. Nevertheless, the joint effect produced by the building energy performance and the architectural, typological, and physical-technical attributes seems poorly studied. Thus, the aim of this work is to investigate the influence of both energy performance and diverse features on property prices, by performing spatial analyses on a sample of housing properties listed on Turin's real estate market and on different sub-samples. In particular, Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses (ESDA) statistics, standard hedonic price models (Ordinary Least Squares-OLS) and Spatial Error Models (SEM) are firstly applied on the whole data sample, and then on three different sub-samples: two territorial clusters and a sub-sample representative of the most energy inefficient buildings constructed between 1946 and 1990. Results demonstrate that Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) labels are gaining power in influencing price variations, contrary to the empirical evidence that emerged in some previous studies. Furthermore, the presence of the spatial effects reveals that the impact of energy attributes changes in different sub-markets and thus has to be spatially analysed.

TI  - Green premium in buildings: Evidence from the real estate market of Singapore
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Different evaluation protocols were proposed to calculate the degree of sustainability of buildings and large-scale projects. In parallel, many studies focused on estimating the economic benefits delivered by green buildings according to the consumer choices using specific econometric models. The study aims to investigate the awareness of the benefits deriving from Green Mark-labeled buildings in Singapore through the application of the hedonic pricing method. In particular, the impact of the Green Mark was assessed in the multi-family building sector, starting from a transaction dataset of approximately 300,000 units sold between 2005 and 2017. Given the spatial complexity of the multi-family buildings market, spatial autocorrelation models were recommended. In particular, the spatial lag model (SAR) and the spatial error model (SEM) were applied. The paper implements the property valuation literature in the field of spatial econometrics related to sustainable certification. Besides, the research provided an assessment of the sustainability scheme over time, highlighting consumer behavior in different phases of the real estate market in Singapore. The results highlighted how spatial models filter the autocorrelation effect. As for the impact of Green Mark on the sale price of the apartments, the results confirmed that a green premium exists.

TI  - Optimization of passive solar design and integration of building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) system in northern housing
T2  - BUILDING SIMULATION
AB  - In the Canadian north, the cost of space heating is very high due to the harsh weather, its remoteness, lack of transportation, and dependency on the high cost of fossil fuel imported from the South. Since the North has an abundance of solar energy, significant energy savings with some added construction cost in houses could be achieved by applying high-performance building envelopes and solar design strategies. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of both passive and active solar design strategies in improving the energy efficiency of northern housing. Firstly, a reference house representing a typical single-family home in the North is modeled using EnergyPlus, and the key passive design parameters are optimized to minimize life-cycle cost. Then, the air-based building integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPV/T) system is applied to the optimized house and integrated with HVAC systems. It is found that optimal passive solar design can reduce the heating energy demand by 42% with an incremental cost of 8% for Yellowknife and by 27% without incurring an incremental cost for Kuujjuaq. Integrating BIPV/T with HVAC systems can reduce the defrost time of heat recovery ventilator (HRV), extend the working hours and improve the COP of air source heat pump (ASHP). The reduction in the total energy consumption is in the range of 1.4%-3.0% by integrating HRV and 0.3%-0.6% by integrating ASHP due to the mis-match of solar availability and heating energy demand. To maximize the utilization of solar energy available, the optimal use of thermal energy recovered from BIPV/T system in northern housing requires further investigation.

TI  - Valuing sustainability in real estate: a case study of the United Arab Emirates
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine if there is an impact of sustainability on the market in terms of a green premium or a brown discount on the price of commercial and residential real estate. It also seeks to identify the incentives and barriers for sustainable developments perceived by real estate professionals. Design/methodology/approach The paper investigates the impact of sustainability features on the valuation of buildings in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study uses a qualitative structured questionnaire to determine the views of certified real estate valuers and advisors on this subject. Findings The results suggest a green premium of at least 1% in the UAE, coming from both supply-side and demand-side, and in commercial and residential sectors. Key barriers for the recognition of green building value include availability of reliable market data, lack of relevant technical skills and apparent client disinterest. Initiatives that would encourage green buildings include financial incentives for key stakeholders, raising and enforcing building standards, and higher energy prices. This paper identifies policy measures that local authorities may consider in transforming to a more sustainable economy. It is expected that such changes would convey to the real estate industry and affiliated stakeholders the financial benefits to be gained from investing in green buildings. Research limitations/implications The UAE is not a transparent environment in terms of building prices and rents, and it can be challenging even for experienced professionals to determine whether an observed higher value can truly be considered a green premium. The second issue is that the results may be affected by a "voluntary response bias", whereby recipients who are interested in sustainability are more likely to have responded to the survey. Practical implications This paper identifies policy measures that local authorities may consider in transforming to a more sustainable economy. It is expected that such changes would convey to the real estate industry and affiliated stakeholders the financial benefits to be gained from investing in green buildings. Originality/value Most research exploring the value of green buildings originates from developed economies and its applicability to the Middle East is questionable due to its differing origins and unusual development path. This article offers new insights into an under-researched market.

TI  - Understanding green building energy performance in the context of commercial estates: A multi-year and cross-region analysis using the Australian commercial building disclosure database
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - To understand the relationship between green building energy performance and regional commercial estates, this study analysed Australia's Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) program database. This database discloses the annual energy use intensity (EUI) and the corresponding energy rating (1-6 stars) of 2460 National Australian Built Environment Rating System (NABERS) certified office buildings. The study selected for analysis Australia's six largest cities and then used panel data regression, where commercial estate factors (total stock of office buildings, vacancy rate, average gross face rent, and government incentives such as financial support) served as independent variables and the EUI was the dependent variable. The p-values of all the models are below 0.05, indicating that the results are statistically significant. Results showed the commercial real estate factors were significantly related to the EUI for buildings with a rating of 1 star and above. The correlation between EUI and commercial real estate factors became less strong with the rating level increasing. The effect of 'green building' branding makes the office buildings more attractive with regard to tenancy and their energy performance more reflective of the variation in the commercial real estate market. This study is a frontrunner in contextualising green building energy performance and ratings in the context of regional commercial estate, and the regression models employed in the study could be used to define regional baselines for energy ratings in future studies.

TI  - Investigating spatial variability of CO2 emissions in heavy industry: Evidence from a geographically weighted regression model
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - China is now the world's largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter, and the government is under tremendous pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. The heavy industry sector is the largest contributor to the growth of CO2 emissions. Investigating the driving factors of this industry's CO2 emissions has important practical value. This paper applies the geographically weighted regression model to survey this industry's CO2 emissions. Empirical results show that urbanization exerts a heterogeneous impact on CO2 emissions across provinces and regions. This is mainly due to the differences in urban real estate and transportation infrastructure investments. Economic growth drives CO2 emissions, and this effect varies significantly by region and province on account of the differences in fixed-asset investment. It is more reasonable for local governments to develop emerging economies based on their specific conditions. Energy efficiency has the highest impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region, because of the differences in R&D personnel investment and the number of patents granted. The energy consumption structure has the largest impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region since it consumes more coal. Environmental regulations have a greater impact on CO2 emissions in the western region due to the differences in investment for industrial pollution control.

AB  - By analyzing the adoption of the European Public Real Estate Association's (EPRA) Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations (sBPR), we examine and discuss the application of transparent environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings and their interaction with public real estate performance across European markets. Due to increasing concerns about the environment and the impact of investment on society at large, public property companies have made significant progress in improving transparency and enhancing the protection of shareholder value by sharing and reporting ESG best practices. We explore and review the EPRA sBPR database, which is highly useful for investors who are already screening listed real estate companies. Hence, in this project, we carefully study the diffusion process of this new ESG metric as a tool to enhance informational transparency regarding public real estate investment management and assess the effects of this transparency and ESG performance for the real estate stock returns. We find evidence of a sustainability premium that investors are willing to pay to access companies with better sustainable ratings.

TI  - Reducing residential energy consumption through a marketized behavioral intervention: The approach of Household Energy Saving Option (HESO)
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Behavioral strategies of occupant energy conservation are essential to counter the effect of growing energy demand. The wide application of occupant energy interventions, such as providing subsidies to promote energy saving, involves continuous financial investments, which has been a particular challenge to subsidy providers, i.e. national energy agencies. Exploring the cost-effective interventions is essential in the case of promoting household energy conservation in the long term. In this study, a promising strategy to lighten the financial burden of energy policy providers - Household Energy Saving Option (HESO) is proposed and validated. HESO is an option-based strategy that offers buyers (i.e. households) an opportunity to earn the reward, depending on whether they can achieve the pre-determined energy saving goal. A conceptual framework of HESO is established, which consists of five elements, namely theoretical foundation (T), integrated interventions (I), market premises (M), energy sustainability (E), and stakeholders (S). To test the effectiveness of HESO on household energy reduction, a preliminary experiment was conducted in 101 households living in Singapore and the results demonstrated that HESO has a positive effect on encouraging home electricity conservation based on the Difference-in-Difference (DID) analysis. Compared to the baseline of household energy consumption, HESO-induced energy reduction was 8.18% and 12.56% when saving goals were set at 5% and 10%, respectively. Possible reasons to explain different effects of HESO on energy reduction have been elaborated, including the effect of positive feedback and re-adjustment of households' energy saving motivation during the transition period. Key determinants of HESO's success have also been discussed, such as management of cash-flow liquidity and design of goal difficulty. HESO shifts costs from energy policy providers to the households who fail to achieve their goals, which significantly improves the cost-efficiency of residential energy reduction strategies. This study contributes to the literature by developing a framework of option-based residential energy saving intervention. The results enlighten a promising and scalable solution by using a marketized intervention for promoting effective energy conservation in households while minimizing the cost burden borne by the city government.

TI  - Addressing disasters in smart cities through UAVs path planning and 5G communications: A systematic review
T2  - COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - UAVs are increasingly incorporated in a wide range of domains such as disaster management and rescue missions. UAV path planning deals with finding the most optimal or shortest path for UAVs such that minimum energy and resources are utilized. This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning's key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness. Accordingly, a holistic IoT-powered UAV-based smart city management system has been recommended in the current study where all the smart city key components are integrated to address disasters like floods, earthquakes, and bush fire. The proposed holistic system can help prepare for disasters and mitigate them as soon as these arise and help enhance the smart city governance.

TI  - How to achieve a low-carbon transition in the heavy industry? A nonlinear perspective
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - The heavy industry is the main source of CO2 emissions. Examining the influencing factors of the heavy industry's CO2 emissions is essential for this industry to achieve a low-carbon transition. Existing research literature often assumes that the relationship between the influencing factors and CO2 emissions is linear. In fact, most economic phenomena are characterized by fluctuations, due to the influence of business cycles. This often leads to more likely nonlinear relationships between economic variables. This paper uses nonparametric additive regression model to investigate CO2 emissions from China's heavy industry. The empirical findings show that economic growth, urbanization, and energy efficiency exert a "first promotion, then restriction" inverted "Ushaped" nonlinear effect on CO2 emissions. To complicate matters further, energy consumption structure and export dependence have an "N-shaped" nonlinear effect on CO2 emissions. Therefore, in the early stage, the government should actively optimize the industrial structure, strengthen the management of the real estate industry, and expand R&D investment. In the long run, the government should subsidize the heavy industry to expand clean energy consumption, and provide tax incentives to support the export of high-tech industrial products.

TI  - Mapping the energy poverty: A case study based on the energy performance certificates in the city of Bologna
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Energy poverty is defined as the condition in which low-income people is no more able to face the costs of energy bills and consequently accept to live in cold and uncomfortable houses. In recent years the scientific literature about this specific issue has registered a significant growth, despite the problem is mainly approached from an econometric point of view to which instead medical, social and energy aspects have to be coupled. Recent EU policies like the Clean Energy Package and the Energy Building Performance Directive Recast III encourage to increase the efforts to tackle and eradicate the energy poverty.
   The paper approaches the problem focusing on one of its complementary causes: the building energy performance. The adopted methodology includes the calculation of the energy costs for each household, the definition of the energy poverty threshold, the calculation of the related building energy performance limit, otherwise leading to the energy poverty condition. These data, associated with the energy performance certificates, are used to create a GIS based mapping of the buildings potentially affected by energy poverty. Maps can be used to support decision making process in addressing appropriate strategies at urban level to tackle the energy poverty risk. The paper includes a case study in the city of Bologna where the proposed methodology is tested. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy poverty. How can you fight it, if you can't measure it?
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Energy poverty is a complex and multidimensional problem, lying at the intersection between household income, energy costs and the energy efficiency of the housing stock. Despite a growing interest and several new initiatives to contrast energy poverty, there are still relevant problems regarding its definition and measurement. In this work, we review the existing definitions, measures and policies with a specific focus on Italy. We present an indicator developed in a er Faiella and Lavecchia (2015) and recently adopted by the Government as the official measure of energy poverty for Italy. According to this indicator, in 2016 there were over 2.2 million energy-poor households or 8.6% of the total. We also introduce a new indicator of energy poverty, independent from households' preferences, derived from the heating expenditure needed to achieve a minimum comfort level. According to this new measure, there were around 3 million fuel poor households in 2014-16 (11.7% of all households). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Thermal resistance of multi-functional panels in cold-climate regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - In recent years, energy efficiency and sustainability have garnered widespread attention as buildings account for 30-40% of total primary energy use in North America and 24% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Owing to the cold climate in Canada, energy-efficient building practices have drawn significant interest among authorities and researchers who aim to develop sustainable means of improving energy efficiency. Among these means is the use of environmentally friendly building materials that also contribute to improving thermal resistance. This research investigates and evaluates the long-term thermal performance of innovative multi-functional panels (MFPs) in various wall assembly configurations for residential buildings under varying climatic conditions. The two types of MFPs under investigation combine two layers of wood sheathing with either wood fiber or extruded polystyrene (XPS) as an additional external layer to conventional light wood-frame wall assemblies in order to improve the overall energy efficiency of the conventional wall assemblies. For this purpose, two full-scale identical demonstration buildings (test houses) are built for in-situ testing-one located in the cold continental climate of Edmonton, Canada, and the other in the humid coastal climate of Vancouver, Canada. The two types of MFPs (with wood fiber or XPS) are added to conventional wall assemblies and placed on both north and south facades of each of the test houses. Sensors are installed on each wall assembly under controlled indoor climatic conditions to monitor temperature, moisture content, and heat flux at the inner, middle, and outer layers and at three different vertical levels for each wall assembly. The indoor climatic conditions are maintained by installing a floor heating system, an air conditioner, and a rotating fan for even air circulation. Also, each test house is equipped with a weather station to monitor solar radiation, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, outdoor temperature, and relative humidity, among other metrics such as dew point, wind direction, and wind speed. Results from this study demonstrate the effect of various weather conditions on the thermal performance of MFPs in comparison with conventional wall assemblies and future research will determine the long-term hygrothermal performance of the MFPs under investigation. The ongoing long-term study will provide a practical guideline for the use of wood fiber-an environmentally friendly and recyclable material-as a sustainable insulation material in the North American housing market.

TI  - Temperature Effects on Electricity and Gas Consumption: Empirical Evidence from Mexico and Projections under Future Climate Conditions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Fixed effects panel models are used to estimate how the electricity and gas consumption of various sectors and residents relate to temperature in Mexico, while controlling for the effects of income, manufacturing output per capita, electricity and gas prices and household size. We find non-linear relationships between energy consumption and temperature, which are heterogeneous per state. Electricity consumption increases with temperature, and this effect is stronger in warm states. Liquified petroleum gas consumption declines with temperature, and this effect is slightly stronger in cold states. Extrapolations of electricity and gas consumption under a high warming scenario reveal that electricity consumption by the end of the century for Mexico increases by 12%, while gas consumption declines with 10%, resulting in substantial net economic costs of 43 billion pesos per year. The increase in net energy consumption implies greater efforts to comply with the mitigation commitments of Mexico and requires a much faster energy transition and substantial improvements in energy efficiency. The results suggest that challenges posed by climate change also provide important opportunities for advancing social sustainability goals and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This study is part of Mexico's Sixth National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

TI  - Beyond building certification: The impact of environmental interventions on commercial real estate operations
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - We extend the commonly-studied definition of investment in sustainable and energy efficient real estate beyond environmental building certification to include three additional types of environmentally-focused building interventions: environmentally-focused capital expenditure (capex); monitoring; and, tenant engagement. Appealing to behavioral economics and finance theory, we test for a connection between changes in tenant and property management behavior and electricity consumption. Through a partnership with a global institutional investment manager, this study examines ten years of asset-level operating statement and electricity consumption data in Canadian and U.S. office buildings, measuring both the initial impact of such interventions as well as any adjustments observed over time. Analysis of the proprietary intervention data allows us to better understand the impact of varied environmental interventions on the electricity consumption of commercial real estate. We find that all four intervention categories, including building certification, are associated with decreased electricity consumption, with tenant engagement providing an immediate decrease that is maintained over time. Environmentally-focused capex is also associated with decreased electricity consumption in both Canada and the U.S. Taken together the results indicate that utility consumption and its associated costs are only minimized when multiple environmental interventions are implemented.

TI  - Building Industry and Energy Efficiency: A Review of Three Major Issues at Stake
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT VI
CP  - 21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
AB  - During the last two decades, the European Union regulation has paid more and more attention to the issue of energy efficiency, especially as far as the building sector is concerned. Lately, the adoption of the European Green Deal (EGD) has further fueled interest in the topic. The building industry is expected to step forward towards decarbonization, as well as to mobilize towards a clean and circular economy, so supporting the pursuit of climate neutrality. In this position paper, we aim to discuss three major issues at stake, which are crucial to increase the renovation rate of the building stock and, hence, to the success of the EGD. The first key issue is whether a cost premium has to be expected due to retrofit projects. The second key issue is whether or not the large swing currently experienced in the price premium for building energy efficiency undermines stakeholders' confidence. The third key issue is whether we need tailored evaluation methodologies for energy-efficient building portfolios.

TI  - Perceived Benefits of Energy Efficiency in the Spanish Residential Market and Their Relation to Sociodemographic and Living Conditions
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Featured Application
   Tailoring of energy performance diffusion regarding public and private policies in countries where energy efficiency is not clearly seen as a source of benefits in the residential context.
   Within the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive information symmetry regarding financial and environmental benefits, coming from real estate performance, is a key element in the promotion of efficient buildings. However, the link between energy efficiency and its perceived co-benefits is far from perfect in EU countries with a short trajectory in the promotion of such residential attributes, endangering the efficacy of information-symmetry policies. Using a large survey applied to sellers, buyers, lessors and tenants this paper explores, in Spain, the perceived co-benefits in terms of energy savings and thermal comfort of efficient homes and whether such perception correlates to current living conditions, housing tenure and sociodemographic profile of respondents. Results suggest that in general such co-benefits are present in the mind of the main agents of the housing market. However, their perception is far from being homogeneous, it is clearer in the case of households whose current home is poorly insulated or inadequately serviced in terms of thermal active systems. Sociodemographic conditions also play a role in co-benefits perceptions: Elder, wealthier and landlords, irrespective of whether they act as sellers, buyers or lessors, do perceive to a larger extent the co-benefits of efficient homes. Such findings signal clear paths for the improvement of energy and housing policy.

TI  - Integrated Strategies for Preserving and Enhancing the Historical Heritage of the University of Pavia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The University of Pavia owns an extensive real estate portfolio, largely consisting of historic buildings still hosting teaching and research activities. This implies a continuous challenge in keeping them efficient, sustainable and completely usable. Indeed, these heritage buildings, alongside an undeniable charm, bring with them deficiencies regarding safety, accessibility, energy efficiency, etc. This work presents an interdisciplinary strategy addressing the issues involved in the management of the multiple needs of conservation and use, complying with modern standards. The legal requirement of a seismic safety assessment was the occasion to launch a comprehensive review of the state of the University building heritage, considering together the different aspects involved, in a perspective of economic sustainability, combining preservation needs and valorisation. The steps of this strategy included a preliminary screening of all the buildings, by simple methods and tools. The aim was to gather homogeneous and comparable information, useful to identify critical structures and/or repeated issues, to allocate resources for deeper analyses and implementation. The case study of San Felice Palace, which presents emblematic features and deficiencies, is illustrated in more detail, with complete seismic safety and accessibility analyses leading to proposals of enhancement interventions.

TI  - NZEB and market-based renovation case study of an existing office building
T2  - COLD CLIMATE HVAC & ENERGY 2021
CP  - 10th International SCANVAC Cold Climate Conference
AB  - The goal of decarbonizing the building stock in the EU requires a multi-fold increase of the current renovation rates. In Estonia, the non-residential building sector has had little or no public support to improve the energy efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to study the energy efficient and cost-optimal measures for non-residential building renovation to give guidance to real estate companies and other stakeholders about the renovation alternatives. Furthermore, crucial is to provide input to the government to develop the renovation grant and incentives for renovation. In this study, energy renovation measures and savings to improve the energy performance to NZEB level were identified in a large (16 990 m(2) heated area) office building. For that purpose, energy use was measured, simulation model developed and calibrated, feasible and more comprehensive energy improvements and costs analysed. The improvement of lighting, AHU, heating, installation of a 69 kW PV system, and window replacement was needed to achieve the goal with a primary energy use of 163 kWh/m(2). However, some of the applied measures had long payback times of 40-70 years and are not realistic to be implemented without renovation incentives.

TI  - Building Codes: What Are They Good For?
T2  - CITYSCAPE
AB  - This article presents an economic framework for evaluating the net benefits or costs of building code regulations through their effect on housing markets, accounting for distributional impacts. The role of building codes can primarily be classified into three scenarios: (1) An industry standard that reduces transaction costs; (2) An isolated quality standard; or (3) A quality standard with spillover effects. To holistically evaluate the impact of a particular building regulation, we propose three major guidelines: (1) Correct market failures; (2) Estimate market impacts; and (3) Account for distributional considerations. This framework is applied to energy efficiency regulations and solar panels in particular. Energy efficiency codes reduce negative environmental externalities and information asymmetry and promote high-quality long-term affordable housing stock; however, the willingness to pay for energy efficiency varies with income. Policymakers must consider how policies intended to promote the welfare of low-income housing residents might create exclusionary impacts due to increasing the cost of supplying housing.

TI  - Effects of Renovation on Ventilation and Energy Saving in Residential Building
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
AB  - Renovation usually increases the aesthetic and market value of buildings. Consequently, with the rapid growth of the city's population and skyrocketing demand for decent housing, the current trend of building conversion and renovation of existing and dilapidated property stock within city centres has become rampant. The rise in demand has pushed beyond the boundaries that every real estate investor wants to maximize profit, and it has resulted in the prevalence of uncontrolled building development, land use conversion, and non-compliance with building requirements, etc. Renovations that involve changes in building elements (especially the window system) that can influence energy saving and ventilation efficiency have thus become very common. However, the effects of building renovations on ventilation and energy efficiency have not been fully examined, particularly in Enugu (Nigeria), a rapidly growing colonial metropolis. This research employed a qualitative research approach to investigate the effects of building renovation on ventilation and energy saving in Achara layout, Enugu City, Nigeria. Four blocks of flat residential buildings were the derived sample size using a judgmental sampling technique. Physical measurements, an observation schedule, and oral interviews with site workers centred on window size, area, property, and fenestration type were used to collect empirical data involving the window system. The result reveals a very significant difference between the as-built and renovated window design systems of all studied variables. Its conclusion hinged on the fact that a renovated structure does not encourage effective natural ventilation and hence will consume more energy in cooling and lighting. It recommends the re-introduction of appropriate window systems and construction techniques for the tropical environment to reduce heat stress build-up within building units.

TI  - Promoting energy services in offices: How do office workers see their role?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - Since buildings account for approximately 40% of the energy consumption in EU, all the measures in increasing their energy efficiency should be promoted. Office workers' role in promoting energy services e.g. demand response of the offices is not clear. It has not been assessed, what exactly the stakeholders involved in decision making (employer, real estate manager, property owner) and in maintenance, service and implementation of new technologies (service companies, technology providers) are expecting from the office workers when promoting the energy services. The active role of office workers is often seen just as an enabler of energy savings. In this article, office workers' role and understanding about their potential means in promoting energy services in offices was studied with quantitative on-line surveys and 17 stakeholder interviews in order to support the selection of energy services targeted to these office workers. Interviewees saw office workers' possibilities to promote energy efficiency or demand response actions limited but their acceptance of actions necessary. Other stakeholders can affect to the office workers' acceptance with various means (e.g. with proper communication) and that way increase office energy efficiency. However, participating to demand response actions requires more extensive communication between stakeholders in order to be acceptable, not decrease working efficiency nor damage the property. Office workers could consider more possibilities to promote energy efficiency compared to what other stakeholders expected from them. However, most of them did not see partial fixing of office conditions possible as the other stakeholders did with better view of limitations of the real estate.

AB  - Building design includes a large number of various issues, which must be taken into account in mutual coordination and with optimal consideration of individual factors. Daylighting, insolation, sun protection in hot weather are factors that directly affect the comfort of the indoor environment in buildings and their energy efficiency. It is noted that the above factors also affect the economy through the cost of housing and through operating costs for replenishing heat losses through windows, for ventilation and cooling of buildings, i.e. on the elimination of heat gains through translucent structures, as well as on artificial lighting, for which electricity costs can be comparable depending on the climatic conditions of the construction site and the design features and architecture of buildings, on artificial lighting technology and on technical solutions for air conditioning and ventilation. It provides topics related to daylight, solar radiation, and translucent structures, directly related to building design, partially reflected in the articles of this issue of Light & Engineering journal. Thus, the interrelation of building design issues with various aspects of lighting technologies is indicated.

TI  - Green building, pro-environmental behavior and well-being: Evidence from Singapore
T2  - CITIES
AB  - This paper incorporates environmental psychology insights into a well-being framework related to the built environment to predict the relations between green buildings and their residents in terms of pro-environmental behavior and well-being. To test our predictions, we apply a generalized structural equation modelling technique to a household survey dataset collected from the Singapore private housing market. We find that green building residents have a higher assessment of their residential environment. This increases the level of their residential satisfaction, which subsequently enhances their quality of life and reduces their intention to move. We demonstrate that green buildings provide a supportive and educational environment for motivating and educating their residents to behave in a pro-environmental manner. Residents' improved pro-environmental behavior and enhanced well-being are attributed to some, though not all, green features. We find that tangible green features (i.e., greenery, ventilation, indoor environments, and waste facilities) have greater impacts on residents than intangible ones (i.e., energy efficiency and accessibility to public transport). The findings contribute ideas and solutions to the future development of green buildings by taking a social perspective to pursue urban sustain ability. This paper also inspires future multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of urban studies, psychology, and behavioral science.

TI  - Decision Support System for the Sustainable Seismic and Energy Renovation of Buildings: Methodological Layout
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In Italy, as in many other European countries, a large part of the real estate was built before the issue of restrictive regulations regarding seismic resistance and energy efficiency. Consequently, most existing buildings show inadequate structural and energy performance. However, although a combined renovation is highly recommended, and despite relevant tax incentives which are currently available, the building retrofit market is still struggling to take off. In fact, the lack of information and/or awareness of the involved parties and the consequent difficulty for condominiums to approve the retrofit works are often insuperable obstacles. A Decision Support System (DSS) may help in evaluating and comparing different combined renovation scenarios, thus promoting the regeneration of the building stock. This study presents a new methodology for the selection of the optimal building renovation scenario through a DSS, which is conceived as a tool to allow a quick, simple and effective identification of the best retrofit strategy, based on a priority scale (e.g., costs and duration of intervention, disruption to the occupants, environmental sustainability, energy savings, thermal comfort, structural safety). For this purpose, the DSS calculates suitable performance indices and relative costs. Finally, the system proposes a ranking of the best combined retrofit scenarios. This research study is still ongoing and next steps will deal with the calibration of the proposed methodology.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - Recent studies have sought to explore the relationship between environmental and financial performance, in particular the relationship between the energy efficiency level of a building and its financial value. The present real estate dataset contains 43 variables of repeat sales transactions, energy performance certificate (EPC) rating, index of multiple deprivation (IMD), and geographical location of properties in England and Wales involved in a total of 4,201 transactions from 1995 to 2012. This dataset enables researchers and practitioners to further explore important questions regarding the nexus between the real estate industry, sustainability levels, and socio-economic aspects. Due to the scarcity of publicly available quality real estate data, the dataset detailed in this article may play a relevant role by becoming easily discoverable, clearly explained, and structured to be ready to be used by researchers, analysts, and policymakers. The empirical analysis of the economic case for energy-efficient dwellings in the UK private rental market performed in Fuerst, et al. [1] is based on this dataset. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Exploring the cost burden of rural rental housing
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - As rural landscapes change in both geography and population, it is increasingly important to understand the unique challenges faced by these communities. Of notable significance is the rising cost of housing relative to household income - a measure often referred to as the housing cost-burden. Its subsequent effect on affordable and accessible housing is experienced on a national level, yet perceptions often place rural communities among the most vulnerable. The proceeding research seeks to challenge this notion and further analyze what rural residents, specifically rural renters, face in managing their housing costs. For instance, utilities are an often overlooked contribution to the severity of the overall burden. Their presence as fixed, unadjusted, housing costs lie in aggregate of more direct expenditures. While utilities may lack immediacy, they are pervasive in their prolonged impact. Therefore, it is a combination of factors that make sub-populations of rural areas more susceptible to housing cost externalities. The importance lies in the subtle differences, where considerable policy opportunities exist.

TI  - Conceptualising housing costs: The hidden face of energy poverty in Poland
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The study proposes an approach to assess a hidden aspect of energy poverty (EP) in Poland. We consider households' energy under-consumption driven by low energy efficiency and budgetary constraints. A household is exposed to hidden energy poverty (HEP) if it's total disposable income after deducting the expected housing cost falls under the established threshold. To approximate the expected total housing expenditures, the data from the EU-SILC dataset on dwellings parameters, households' attributes and regional characteristics of Poland is used.
   The results show that in 2017 the scale of exposure to HEP in Poland was 23.7 per cent and this phenomenon is to some extent linked to income poverty. There is a clear distinction between subjective EP indicators and exposure to HEP. Two different profiles of exposed to HEP households in Poland are constructed. The first group lives in detached houses and is composed of households with dependent children. The second group consists of elderly people inhabiting blocks of flats. Both groups should be targeted by separate policies.

TI  - Valuation of energy performance certificates in the rental market - Professionals vs. nonprofessionals
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The implementation of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) is expected to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by providing actors with information that can be used to make better-informed decisions. This paper is the first to investigate EPCs in the Norwegian residential rental market. Applying the hedonic multilevel approach using information from some 440,000 rental contracts over the period of 2011-2018, we find that labeled dwellings have a premium compared with non-labeled dwellings, and that the premium is increasing with a higher EPC-label. We further define two classes of lessors - professional (real estate agents) and nonprofessionals (homeowners) - to study potential heterogeneity in EPC valuation and find that professionals assign higher rents compared with nonprofessionals. Dwellings with high energy efficiency are associated with a higher premium if rented out by a professional, a significant part of which stemming from higher EPC valuation. The results are robust to a number of heterogeneity analyses and after controlling for sample selection bias and unobserved locational heterogeneity. The findings of this paper signify the necessity to increase awareness and public dissemination regarding the EPC policy.

TI  - Determinants of the household electricity consumption efficiency of an ageing population: Evidence for the EU-28
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
CP  - 7th International Conference on Energy and Environment Research (ICEER) - Driving Energy and Environment in 2020 Towards A Sustainable Future
AB  - This paper explores the determinants of household electricity consumption efficiency of an ageing population. The analysis is pursued for the 28 member states of the European Union between 2005 and 2016. These determinants are evaluated through the employment of the econometric method Fractional Regression Model. Results indicate that the share of renewables in heating and cooling, the government expenditures in housing and community and the housing cost burden below 60% for people aged 65 and over, are the main drivers that impulse the efficiency levels positively. On the other hand, the old age dependency ratio, and the housing cost burden above 60% for people aged 65 and over, affect the efficiency levels negatively. The main contribution of the study is to underline the relevance of the socio-economic household characteristics of an ageing population strata in explaining the residential electricity consumption efficiency.

TI  - FINDING EVIDENCE OF GREEN LEASING IN UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT-LEASED PROPERTIES
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Although the term "green leasing" is not yet well defined, its primary purpose is clear. With an aim to create a collaborative environment through legal provisions between a building owner and a tenant, green leasing may ultimately help resolve the energy paradox in tenanted properties. Issues surrounding split-incentives are driven by a mismatch between owners' capital expenditures on improving building energy efficiency and an uncertainty of tenant or occupant behavior that might affect a building's energy consumption. Though some countries have started to develop guidelines promoting the adoption of green leasing, especially in government buildings and commercial real estate, implementation has not been overly successful globally. This study has two focuses, the first of which is to compare green leasing guidelines from various countries and to suggest six comprehensive categories of green leasing components: management relationships, information sharing, certificates, legal stipulations, financial factors, and operation. The second core area of research places government-tenanted properties' lease agreement contracts. The goal is to find any evidence in a legal condition between a building owner and a tenant, in this case federal government, to improve building energy efficiency with less environmental impact in the United States. The findings of the study indicated 41 out of 400 leases had green clauses. Three out of six categories proposed in this study were found in the U.S. government-tenanted properties, while the other three types were not shown. The findings of this study also suggest categories of green leasing clauses can contribute to defining green leasing and provide empirical evidence of green leasing in government-tenanted properties. Ultimately, this study produces arguments for possible reasoning behind the employment of some green lease categories but the lack of use of others, specifically in the U.S. office market and government-tenanted buildings.

TI  - When Residential Energy Labeling Becomes Irrelevant: Sustainability vs. Profitability in the Liberalized Chilean Property Market
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The study of the relevance of energy efficiency attributes on residential choices is usually based on stated preferences, using performance indicators. However, this issue has not been researched in developing countries, where energy certification schemes have a low adoption rate. This article paper uses a methodology based on a Kansei Engineering and Kano Model to identify home buyers' energy performance perceptions in three real estate developments in Santiago de Chile. Surprisingly, energy ratings negatively affected the survey respondents' willingness to buy. On the other hand, the ratings indicated that the most relevant attribute for influencing the purchasing is the perception of the home as a good investment. This finding contradicts most of the studies on energy certification and shows the relevance given to the profit of purchasing new housing units. Therefore, the analyses suggest that this situation represents a decoupling of consumer perception from both the items measured by energy labels and their contribution to consumer choices.

TI  - Optimal management of home loads with renewable energy integration and demand response strategy
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - The implementation of proper energy management techniques and utilization of renewable energy resources enhance the energy efficiency and stability of future grid systems. This research proposed a home energy management model consisting of microgrid framework and demand side management (DSM) technique. To reduce peak load, peak to average, and energy cost, households' loads were shifted on the basis of price-based tariff such as flexible and time of use tariff. Simulation was carried out using binary particle swarm optimization algorithm in MATLAB. The microgrid was mathematically modeled, and the impacts of DSM integrated microgrid were analysed for different households in terms of electricity cost reduction. Simulations suggested that DSM implementation significantly reduced peak loads and renewable resources produced trade-off. Renewable energy integration with DSM can be a promising approach for the significant reduction in total electricity cost of households by paying less for purchasing electricity and selling the surplus electricity to the grid.

TI  - The "green lemon" problem - a study of the effect of partial disclosure of poorer assessment ratings on housing prices
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The introduction of green building certifications, on the one hand, can provide useful information for different stakeholders, such as developers and buyers, to evaluate "green" buildings' environmental performance. On the other hand, it gives rise to an issue resembling the "lemons" problem in New Institutional Economics, as sellers such as developers and owners of properties with poorer ratings do not disclose, or only partially disclose this information to the public. Given that a likely result of this "lemons" problem is lower average market prices that drive good products out of the market, this paper, thus, investigates this latent issue by assessing how the knowledge of these "lemons", referring to BEAM Plus-assessed buildings with an "Unclassified" rating, influences the price effect of BEAM Plus certification for other certified properties. Utilizing Bayesian Modeling, the findings indicate that should the "green lemons", or BEAM Plus-assessed properties with an Unclassified rating, be known, the price premium for other BEAM Plus-certified properties on Hong Kong Island and in the New Territories is higher than the scenario under which "green lemons" are not known as thus mistaken as non-assessed properties. This finding is akin to the traditional "lemons" issue which can result in the saturation of "lemons" in the market due to lower average prices that drive the good quality products out of it. This situation, we believe, is further exacerbated by the HKSAR government's GFA Concession Policy that grants GFA concessions to projects assessed under BEAM Plus regardless of rating, which is reflected by the high percentage of assessed projects with an "unclassified" rating. A higher degree of disclosure for these "lemons" compared to what is required now, according to the findings, could benefit potential investors and the BEAM Society alike. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Estimation of change in house sales prices in the United States after heat pump adoption
T2  - NATURE ENERGY
AB  - Estimating the costs of green home improvements is not possible without accurate estimates of their impact on house prices. Now, Shen et al. use the sales data of more than 400,000 properties in the United States to determine how heat pump installations increase house prices.
   Electrifying most fossil-fuel-burning applications provides a pathway to achieving cost-effective deep decarbonization of the economy. Heat pumps offer a feasible and energy-efficient way to electrify space heating. Here, we show a positive house price premium associated with air source heat pump installations across 23 states in the United States. Residences with an air source heat pump enjoy a 4.3-7.1% (or US$10,400-17,000) price premium on average. Residents who are environmentally conscious, middle class and live in regions with mild climate are more likely to pay a larger price premium. We find that estimated price premiums are larger than the calculated total social benefits of switching to heat pumps. Policymakers could provide information about the estimated price premium to influence the adoption of heat pumps.

TI  - Valuing energy solutions in the housing markets: the role of market devices and real estate agents
T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - New energy technologies present opportunities for low-carbon housing but also significant upfront costs for house owners. Due to the long service life of such technologies, market valuation impacts on the feasibility of such investments. Yet, existing evidence on the market valuation of energy investments in private housing is inconclusive. Furthermore, despite significant policy efforts, energy performance certificates remain ineffective. This paper addresses these gaps with a study of real estate agents and the use of market devices, such as tools, databases, classification schemes, inspection protocols and market practices. Our analytical framework builds on the sociology of markets, actor network theory and pragmatist theories of valuation in order to highlight the material and discursive assemblages and arrangements that intervene in the construction of markets. Drawing on empirical evidence from Finland, the results point to asymmetries in market devices and valuation practices that disfavour energy investments compared to the other key quality attributes of housing.

TI  - Climate zones, energy efficient technologies and advertising: what are residential real estate agents saying?
T2  - PACIFIC RIM PROPERTY RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB  - Energy used in housing is a major contributor to Australia's energy consumption. The country's vastness leads itself into a broad range of climate conditions and each climate zone demands different energy efficient characteristics in housing. Real estate agents play an active role in motivating buyers in purchasing energy efficient housing through advertising. The objective of this research is to examine whether the promotion of house energy efficient features in advertisements is influenced by the climate zones. The research examined detached dwelling advertisements in three climate zones in Victoria, Australia - hot, mild and cool - during the period of 2008 - 2013 with over 40,000 advertisements reviewed. This was complemented by in-depth interviews with nine senior real estate agents practising within these climate zones. Results highlight that energy efficiency features were not considered to be a major factor when advertising residential properties. However, there were differences in advertising characteristics related to energy efficient features across climate zones. Advertisements in colder zones tended to have more energy saving related words. Yet, distinctive design characteristics for different climate zones are not significantly differentiated and agents tend to follow standard wording when describing them.

TI  - Demand Response Management in Smart Homes Using Robust Optimization
T2  - ELECTRIC POWER COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS
AB  - Shortage of nonrenewable energy resources, the pollution arising from extraction and exploitation of these resources, and increasing demand for energy, along with the intermittent nature of renewable resources have resulted in more attention to demand response programs in smart grids. Demand response includes activities like load management, energy efficiency, and energy saving. The residential sector plays a significant role in achieving demand response goals. Home energy management systems shift or restrict a household demand; they consider power price and consumer's wellbeing and improve consumption and production profile of a house. In this work, a price-based, real-time demand response management model is proposed as a home energy management system. The model helps conservative householders save energy and improve energy efficiency through managing electrical appliances. The proposed model can be embedded in an energy control unit or a smart meter and find the optimal operation of the house for next 5 minutes via robust optimization technique, considering uncertainties of power price and distributed generation. The objective is to minimize the electricity costs of a home and improve the role of distributed generation and energy storage system installed inside the home while satisfying user's wellbeing and components constraints. The model is comprehensive, real-time, have high time resolution, and the results show that the model improves the costs of a conservative household.

TI  - Energy Performance Certification: Misassessment due to assuming default heat losses
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are issued when dwellings are constructed, sold or leased in the EU, are the foremost source of information on the energy performance of the EU's building stock. Where the cost of obtaining the required data is prohibitive, EPC assessors use nationally applicable default values. To avoid wrongly-higher EPC ratings for all existing dwellings, a standardised thermal bridging transmittance coefficient (Y-value) is typically adopted together with worst-case overall heat loss coefficients (U-values). These default U-values for roofs, walls and floors are drawn from building codes and regulations applicable at time of construction. Many older dwellings have undergone significant building fabric upgrades. Therefore, default U-values are considerably higher than the real U-values of those upgraded houses. This causes a systematic 'default effect' error in large national EPC datasets. For the dataset considered thermal default use overestimates potential primary energy savings from upgrading by 22% and by 70% in dwellings built before after and before thermal building regulations respectively. A methodology has been developed that derives from an EPC dataset, a method for calculating a realistic energy-improvement payback when use of pessimistic default U-values is unavoidable.

TI  - Assessing Multiple Benefits of Housing Regeneration and Smart City Development: The European Project SINFONIA
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The urban energy transition towards more sustainable energy production and consumption systems is at the top of the European Union political agenda. Several demonstration projects are dealing with the deep-energy retrofit of real-estate assets to show how technological and societal innovation can provide new investment opportunities while enhancing citizens' quality of life by delivering multiple benefits. In this framework, the EU smart city project SINFONIA has developed and tested a new comprehensive framework to define, identify, and evaluate the main multiple benefits expected from similar initiatives. The present contribution reviews the three assessment exercises carried out in the lighthouse city of Bolzano during the project execution, consisting of an investigation of the users' stated preferences, an evaluation of consumers' revealed preferences and a multicriteria analysis of homeowners' priorities. It offers an overview of the main achievements and sheds light on further investigatory paths applicable to Positive Energy Districts assessment.

TI  - The Influence of Energy Certification on Housing Sales Prices in the Province of Alicante (Spain)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - This work examines the implementation of energy labelling by the residential real estate sector. First, it considers the interest by real estate sellers in not publishing energy certification information, and then, it quantifies the impact of the housing's energy certification on the asking price. The results are compared with those obtained from other studies conducted in distinct European countries. The study's final sample was collected, including information from 52,939 multi-family homes placed on the real estate market in the province of Alicante (Spain). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, as well as an ordinary least squares regression model. This study highlights the fact that, in the current market, owners and sellers have no incentive to reveal the energy certification, since this permits them to sell homes with low energy ratings at prices similar to those of more energy efficient homes. In addition, it was found that homes with better energy ratings (letters A and B) are not sold at higher prices than homes with other rating letters, unlike the case of other European countries that were examined.

TI  - Energy Efficiency Package for Tenant Fit-Out: Laboratory Testing and Validation of Energy Savings and Indoor Environmental Quality
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Approximately 40% of the total U.S. office floor space of 1.5 billion sq.m (16 billion sq.ft.) is leased space occupied by tenants. Tenant fit-out presents a key opportunity to incorporate energy efficiency within the real estate business cycle. We designed a package of energy efficiency measures tailored to the scope of a tenant fit-out. This tenant fit-out package (TFP) includes advanced lighting and heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) controls as core measures, with ceiling fans, automated shading, and plug load controls as additional optional measures. We conducted laboratory testing of six configurations of the package to evaluate energy savings, indoor environmental quality, and identify installation, commissioning, and operational issues. Combined savings for HVAC, lighting, and plug loads ranged from 33-40%. Lighting savings ranged from 69-83%, and HVAC savings from 20-40%. The laboratory testing also revealed some minor but tractable challenges with installation and commissioning of HVAC controls. Overall, the results demonstrate that significant savings can be realized in existing office buildings by incorporating relatively low-risk, proven measures at the time of a tenant fit-out.

TI  - Asymmetric information in residential rental markets: Implications for the energy efficiency gap
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper explores whether energy cost information asymmetries exist between landlords and tenants by exploiting variation in which party pays for energy. Because tenants are always fully informed about their total housing costs in the landlord-pay regime, the effect of energy cost changes on tenant turnover, rents, and efficiency investment should differ between the two payment regimes under asymmetric information but not symmetric information. Using energy cost variation in the form of changes in relative heating fuel prices, I find evidence that tenants are uninformed about energy costs. This results in higher energy expenditures for tenants and implies that information campaigns or efficiency standards may improve market outcomes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The value effects of green retrofits
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to decompose the value effects of green retrofits on commercial real estate. The paper disentangles various sources of value capture mechanisms that can be attained through green retrofit actions and profiles the extent to which green retrofit solutions can be effectively capitalised using transaction evidence from the Munich housing market. The insights offered can help real estate owners and investors during theirex anteanalysis of future energetic retrofit investments. Design/methodology/approach The authors offer their reader both a conceptual framework and the results from an empirical analysis to identify the value effects of retrofits and the associating gains in energy efficiency. The conceptual framework theorises the different value components that a deep retrofit has to offer. The regression analysis includes a multivariate analysis of 8,928 dwellings in the Munich residential real estate market. Findings This study's framework disentangles the total retrofit value effect into three components: the capitalisation of energy savings, the exposure to the value discount because of stricter standards and the value uplift because of indirect benefits (health, employee satisfaction, marketing etc.). The regression results indicate that the value gains because of energy efficiency improvements are in the range of 2.4-7.4%, while the indirect benefits and reduced exposure to stricter standards amount to another 3%. Originality/value While numerous studies have investigated the upside value effects of energy efficiency in the real estate sector, there is scant academic research which has sought to evidence the value of green retrofit solutions and the extent to which this can be capitalised. Instrumentalising the various value effects of energetic retrofit that have been identified is not straightforward. At the same time, inadequate value capture of energetic retrofit effects could delay intervention timelines or aborting of proposed retrofit actions which should be of primary concern to policymakers and stakeholders tasked with the decarbonisation of real estate assets.

TI  - Environmental impacts of household appliances in Europe and scenarios for their impact reduction
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Assessing the environmental impact due to consumption of goods and services is a pivotal step towards achieving the sustainable development goal related to responsible production and consumption (i.e. SDG 12). Household appliances plays a crucial role and should be assessed in a systemic manner, namely considering all life cycle stages, technological efficiency, and affluence aspects. The present study assess the impact of such household appliances used in Europe, and tests scenarios of potential impact reduction at various scales. Life cycle assessment is applied to 14 different household appliances (ranging from dishwashers to television devices) selected to build a set of representative products, based on their economic value and diffusion in households in Europe. Related impacts are calculated with the Environmental Footprint method for calculating a Consumer Footprint "appliances" for the baseline year 2010. A number of scenarios encompassing eco-solutions on a technical level, changes in consumption pattern, behavioral changes, as well as the combination of all these aspects are run to estimate the Consumer Footprint related to household appliances for the year 2030, compared against this baseline scenario. The baseline Consumer Footprint is confirming the importance of the use phase in leading the impacts in almost all impact categories. Testing different scenarios concludes that there is a reduction of the impact for most of the categories (with up to 67% for the ozone depletion potential, and still around 35% for the global warming potential), while two of the here examined impact categories (i.e. land-use and mineral resource depletion) show an overall potential that is even negative - i.e. the results of all scenarios are higher than the ones of the 2010 baseline scenario. The increase in purchase and use of such appliances may offset energy efficiency benefits in some of the examined categories. Hence, the assessment of sustainability of appliances consumption should always include several scales, from the efficiency of the products (micro scale), to the improvement of the energy mix (meso scale), up to accounting for socio-economic drivers and patterns of consumption affecting the overall appliances stock (macro scale).

TI  - Shedding new light on residential property price variation in England: A multi-scale exploration
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
AB  - Exploring the nature of spatial and temporal variation in house prices is important because it can help better understand such issues as affordability and equity of access to housing. In the UK, research on house price variation has been hindered by a lack of extensive data linking the prices of properties at different places and times to their physical attributes. This paper addresses this gap through using a new dataset linking Land Registry Price Paid Data to attribute data from Ordnance Survey and Energy Performance Certificates datasets. The new data are used to investigate spatial disparities in England's house prices at four geographical scales (from local authority to individual address) between 2009 and 2016 - a period of sustained price rises after the global financial crisis of 2008. We selected two housing price measures for comparison, namely transaction price and the house price per square metre. Multilevel variance components models are used to estimate variation in the two house price measures at four different spatial scales and we compare spatial disparities in the two measures at these different scales. Our results suggest that accounting for the size of properties by using house price per square metre offers a more accurate picture of house price variation than does the use of transaction prices at the same geographic scale. Spatial disparities in house price per square metre are more apparent and are seen to be clustered at local authority level and highly clustered at Middle Layer Super Output Area level, with imbalances increasing during this eight-year period and highlighting the strong and growing influence of London on the national housing market.

TI  - Study on Multi-Objective Optimization-Based Climate Responsive Design of Residential Building
T2  - ALGORITHMS
AB  - This paper proposes an optimization process based on a parametric platform for building climate responsive design. Taking residential buildings in six typical American cities as examples, it proposes thermal environment comfort (Discomfort Hour, DH), building energy demand (BED) and building global cost (GC) as the objective functions for optimization. The design variables concern building orientation, envelope components, and window types, etc. The optimal solution is provided from two different perspectives of the public sector (energy saving optimal) and private households (cost-optimal) respectively. By comparing the optimization results with the performance indicators of the reference buildings in various cities, the outcome can give the precious indications to rebuild the U.S. residential buildings with a view to energy-efficiency and cost optimality depending on the location.

TI  - Femtojoule per MAC Neuromorphic Photonics: An Energy and Technology Roadmap
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
AB  - Photonic artificial neural networks have garnered enormous attention due to their potential to perform multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations at much higher clock rates and consuming significantly lower power and chip real-estate compared to digital electronic alternatives. Herein, we present a comprehensive power consumption analysis of photonic neurons, taking into account global design parameters and concluding to analytical expressions for the neuron's energy- and footprint efficiencies. We identify the optimal design-space and analyze the performance plateaus and their dependence on a range of physical parameters, highlighting the existence of an optimal data-rate for maximizing the energy efficiency. Following a survey of the best-in-class integrated photonic devices, including on-chip lasers, photodetectors, modulators and weighting elements, the mathematically calculated energy and footprint efficiencies are mapped into real photonic neuron deployment scenarios. We reveal that silicon photonics can compete with the best-performing currently available digital electronic neural network engines, reaching TMAC/s/mm(2) footprint- and sub-pJ/MAC energy efficiencies. Simultaneously, neuromorphic plasmonics, plasmo-photonics and sub-wavelength photonics hold the credentials for 1 to 3 orders of magnitude improvements even when the laser requirements and a reasonable waveguide pitch are accounted for, promising performance at a few fJ/MAC and up to a few TMAC/s/mm(2).

TI  - The wandering energy stars: The challenges of valuing energy efficiency in Australian housing
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - In the context of curbing greenhouse gas emissions to meet the ambitious but much-needed targets to limit global warming to reasonable levels, residential housing can play a significant role. By enhancing the energy efficiency of residential housing, emission reductions, reduced costs and better health and wellbeing of occupants may be achieved. Despite gradual improvements in home energy efficiency, homeowner engagement could be greatly enhanced by the demonstration of how energy efficiency and energy ratings can be reflected in residential property values. Ascertaining the value of energy efficiency may enable greater investment and potential for increased availability of finance for added energy efficiency options in new and existing housing. Extant research suggests a significant relationship between house values, rental prices and energy efficiency certifications, particularly where mandatory disclosure operates. However, limited research has examined residential valuers' (appraisers) perspectives and practice considerations.
   This paper examines the challenges for valuers in identifying and considering energy efficiency initiatives and ratings on residential property value and the capacity of residential valuation professionals to incorporate energy efficiency into the valuation (appraisal) process.
   The research identified limited means available to valuers in Australia in identifying energy efficiency attributes and ratings; challenges in awareness, knowledge, and understanding of energy efficiency ratings; and, subsequently, limitations in consideration of initiatives and ratings in valuation. This research affirms findings of other Australian and international studies, suggesting mandatory disclosure and certification are essential if energy efficiency is to be considered by the market and reflected in residential valuation.

TI  - Perspectives of Australian property practitioners on sustainability features in residential property
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Information on sustainability features in the Australian residential property market is available but not always shared with buyers by property practitioners (real estate agents, property valuers/appraisers and financiers/mortgage lenders and brokers), as it is not a regulatory requirement. This paper examines the perspectives of property practitioners on a range of sustainability features in residential property. Drawing insights from combined questionnaires and interviews, property practitioners seem to attribute different levels of importance to sustainability related information depending on whether they view the information from their professional perspective or from their clients' perspective. The results obtained in both 2015 and 2017 confirm that practitioners' perspectives seem to limit the amount and/or type of information they pass on to their clients. Clients are not considering sustainability features as they may not be aware on the existence of such information and are not informed by practitioners about the value of such information. If practitioners share more complete information within the property market buyers would be able to make more informed purchase decisions regarding energy efficiency, sustainable homes, and reduction in operation costs. The property practitioners themselves can utilise this information to have more targeted and information rich marketing strategies.

TI  - Automatic energy demand assessment in low-carbon investments: a neural network approach for building portfolios
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to develop a forecasting tool for the automatic assessment of both environmental and economic benefits resulting from low-carbon investments in the real estate sector, especially when applied in large building stocks. A set of four artificial neural networks (NNs) is created to provide a fast and reliable estimate of the energy consumption in buildings due to heating, hot water, cooling and electricity, depending on some specific buildings' characteristics, such as geometry, orientation, climate or technologies. Design/methodology/approach The assessment of the building's energy demand is performed comparing the as-is status (pre-retrofit) against the design option (post-retrofit). The authors associate with the retrofit investment the energy saved per year, and the net monetary saving obtained over the whole cost after a predetermined timeframe. The authors used a NN approach, which is able to forecast the buildings' energy demand due to heating, hot water, cooling and electricity, both in the as-is and in the design stages. The design stage is the result of a multiple attribute optimization process. Findings The approach here developed offers the opportunity to manage energy retrofit interventions on wide property portfolios, where it is necessary to handle simultaneously a large number of buildings without it being technically feasible to achieve a very detailed level of analysis for every property of a large portfolio. Originality/value Among the major accomplishments of this research, there is the creation of a methodology that is not excessively data demanding: the collection of data for building energy simulations is, in fact, extremely time-consuming and expensive, and this NN model may help in overcoming this problem. Another important result achieved in this study is the flexibility of the model developed. The case study the authors analysed was referred to one specific stock, but the results obtained have a more widespread importance because it ends up being only a matter of input-data entering, while the model is perfectly exportable in other contexts.

TI  - Energy performance certificates and house prices: a quantile regression approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose A number of studies have investigated the relationship between energy performance certificates (EPCs) and house prices. A majority of studies have tended to model energy performance pricing effects within a traditional hedonic conditional mean estimate model. There has been limited analysis that has accounted for the relationship between EPCs and the effects across the pricing distribution. Moreover, there has been limited research examining the "standard cost improvements EPC score", or "potential score". Therefore, this paper aims to quantify and measure the dynamic effects of EPCs on house prices across the price spectrum and account for standardised cost-effective retrofit improvements. Design/methodology/approach Existing EPC studies produce one coefficient for the entirety of the pricing distribution, culminating in a single marginal implicit price effect. The approach within this study applies a quantile regression approach to empirically estimate how quantiles of house prices respond differently to unitary changes in the proximal effects of EPCs and structural property characteristics across the conditional distribution of house prices. Using a data set of 1,476 achieved transaction prices, the quantile regression models apply both assessed EPC score and bands and further examine the potential EPC rating for improved energy performance based on an average energy cost improvement. Findings The findings show that EPCs are valued differently across the quantiles and that conditional quantiles are asymmetrical. Only property prices in the upper quantiles of the price distribution show significant capitalisation effects with energy performance, and only properties with higher EPC scores display positive significant effects at the higher end of the price distribution. There are also brown discount effects evident for lower-rated properties within F- and G-rated EPC properties at the higher end of the pricing distribution. Moreover, the potential energy efficiency rating (score) also shows increased effects with sales prices and appears to minimise any brown discount effects. The findings imply that energy performance is a complex feature that is not easily "averaged" for valuation effect purposes. Originality/value While numerous studies have investigated the pricing effects of EPCs, they have tended to provide a single estimate to determine the relationship with price. This paper extends the traditional analytical insights beyond the conditional mean estimate by examining the quantiles of the relationship between EPCs and house prices to enhance the understanding of this esoteric and complex issue. In addition, this research applies the assessed energy efficiency potential to establish whether effective cost improvements enhance the relationship with sales price and capitalisation effects.

TI  - Macroeconomic assessment of India's development and mitigation pathways
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
AB  - Although a rapidly growing economy, India faces many challenges, including in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Moreover, post-2020 climate actions outlined in India's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement envision development along low-carbon emission pathways. With coal providing almost three-quarters of Indian electricity, achieving such targets will have wide-ranging implications for economic activity. Assessing such implications is the focus of our research. To do so, we use a hybrid modelling architecture that combines the strengths of the AIM/Enduse bottom-up model of energy systems and the IMACLIM top-down economy-wide model. This hybrid architecture rests upon an original dataset that brings together national accounting, energy balance and energy price data. We analyse four scenarios ranging to mid-century: business-as-usual (BAU), 2 degrees C, sustainable 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C. Our 2 degrees C pathway proves compatible with economic growth close to the 6% yearly rate of BAU from 2012 to 2050, at the cost of reduced household consumption but with significant positive impact on foreign debt accumulation. The latter impact stems from improvement of the trade balance, whose current large deficit is the primary cause of high fossil fuel imports. Further mitigation effort backing our 1.5 degrees C scenario shows slightly higher annual GDP growth, thereby revealing potential synergies between deep environmental performance and economic growth. Structural change assumptions common to our scenarios significantly transform the activity shares of sectors. The envisioned transition will require appropriate policies, notably to manage the conflicting interests of entrenched players in traditional sectors like coal and oil, and the emerging players of the low-carbon economy. Key policy insights Low carbon pathways are compatible with Indian growth despite their high investment costs Moving away from fossil fuel-based energy systems would result in foreign exchange savings to the tune of $1 trillion from 2012 to 2050 for oil imports. Achieving deep decarbonization in India requires higher mobilized capital in renewables and energy efficiency enhancements. Phasing out fossil fuels would, however, require careful balancing of interests between conventional and emerging sector players through just transitions.

TI  - HOW DOES THE ROMANIAN STATE SUPPORT THE INCREASE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF BUILDINGS BY USING PUBLIC FUNDS?
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The issue of improving the energy efficiency of buildings in Romania is one of interest, both for the state authorities and for the population. The general purpose is to encourage the production of thermal energy and domestic hot water through the use of renewable energy sources. This is part of the EU's long-term objective of decarbonising the existing and inefficient European real estate park. In order to start renovating the existing buildings on the national territory, considerable financial resources are needed which the owners should have. The Romanian state, through the Agency for Environmental Protection, comes to the support the interested persons by granting financial support within the "Green House" Programs. The present paper includes an analysis of the four "Green House" programs and the public funds used to increase the energy efficiency of the buildings.

TI  - Incentives to (not) disclose energy performance information in the housing market
T2  - RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Disclosure of energy performance certificates (EPCs) is often incomplete, which hampers their effectiveness in relieving information asymmetries between landlords and tenants in the housing market. Even when a certificate is available, landlords do not always disclose it. This contradicts the unraveling result, according to which all landlords should disclose quality information unless it is costly to do so. We leverage a cross-sectional dataset of residential rental advertisements from the Belgian region of Brussels to empirically evaluate incentives to disclose an EPC. We find that two fundamental assumptions for the unraveling result are not confirmed in our setting: tenants do not necessarily value energy performance of rental property and do not appear to rationally adjust their expectations when faced with dwellings that withhold their EPC. The paper formulates specific policy advice for reforming EPC mechanisms to increase disclosure rates. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Costs of clean heating in China: Evidence from rural households in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - To address severe air pollution, the Chinese government plans to replace most residential coal stoves in northern China with clean heating devices by 2021. Coal stove replacement started in the "Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)" region and is expanding throughout northern China. Removing coal stoves reduces air pollutant emissions and hence is beneficial for both air quality and public health, as well as offering greenhouse gas mitigation co-benefits. However, there is little discussion of the economic costs of various clean heating technologies. In this study, we estimate total annual costs (TAC, annualized capital costs plus annual operating costs) for rural households, across cities/counties in the BTH region, to replace their coal stoves with several prevalent clean options-air-source heat pumps with fan coils (ASHPwF), electric resistance heaters with thermal storage (RHwTS), natural gas heaters (NGH), and clean coal briquettes with improved stoves (CCIS). We find: 1) Without subsidies, CCIS have the lowest TAC of all clean options. TAC of unsubsidized CCIS approximately doubles TAC of raw coal with improved stoves (RCIS), while unsubsidized electric/gas heaters cost 3-5 times more than RCIS. Thus, it is important for governments to financially support households' replacement of their coal stoves with clean heaters to facilitate widespread adoption. 2) With subsidies, CCIS have the lowest TAC in all regions except Beijing. In Beijing, generous subsides make ASHPwF-the most energy-efficient option-have the lowest TAC. In Tianjin, TAC of subsidized ASHPwF are slightly higher than CCIS and NGH. Throughout Hebei, except for a few severely cold northern counties where gas prices are high, subsidized NGH have lower TAC than ASHPwF and RHwTS. 3) Cost competitiveness of ASHPwF increases as heat demand increases, (e.g., higher desired indoor tempera tures, larger home sizes, etc.) indicating that ASHP are good options for households with larger home sizes and commercial buildings. 4) Substantial potential exists to reduce heating expenses by improving building energy efficiency particularly in severely cold regions. 5) Cost advantages of NGH vary sharply with gas prices.

TI  - The future of sustainable real estate investments in a post-COVID-19 world
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to suggest that property investors should engage with governments to influence outcomes. Global collaboration is required from the real estate investment community, working closely with governments and legislators, to provide a clear road map to zero carbon emissions. Covid-19 has shown how quickly governments around the world can react with draconian responses, including widespread lockdowns, when faced with an existential threat. What bigger existential threat is there than climate change? Design/methodology/approach Personal viewpoint from general research. Findings Three pillars of likely government and legislative interventions are identified; namely, increased and enhanced energy regulation and carbon pricing to force a rapid switch to green energy sources for buildings; an enhanced role for Energy Performance Certificates, standardised methodologies and strict enforcement; and mandatory reporting of financial and physical climate risks based on the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. It is suggested that property investors should now engage with governments to influence outcomes. Originality/value Personal viewpoint to encourage greater involvement of the real estate investment community in governmental and regulatory decision making.

TI  - Energy, carbon, and cost analysis of rural housing retrofit in different climates
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - A large portion of rural residential buildings in developing countries neglecting climate and the low construction quality has resulted in high-energy consumption in this sector. Besides, low economic power and awareness make it difficult to invest in energy upgrades in rural areas. Therefore, low-cost energy retrofit strategies are required to reduce energy levels and improve occupants living conditions while minimizing adverse environmental effects. This study aims to define optimum retrofit strategies for rural buildings based on their economic viability, environmental impact, and comfort benefits in the form of a multi-criteria decision support tool for retrofit projects in four represented climates of Iran.
   Three groups of retrofit strategies (architectural, constructional, and renewable) are modelled in four actual rural buildings in different climates. Environmental, economic, and comfort performance of each strategy is calculated via different indices by dynamic simulations. Energy consumption, carbon emission and cost (ECC) analysis are carried out. Different active and passive retrofit measures are evaluated via ECC.
   The main result of this study is a multi-criteria decision making tool for prioritizing retrofitting strategies in rural houses in different climates. According to results, the primary energy demand is reduced between 46 and 55%, the carbon emission is reduced between 40 and 51%, and thermal comfort levels are improved up to 23% in different climate zones.
   In line with the current market prices of Iran (high construction costs and low energy prices due to energy subsidies), the payback time for retrofit actions is not very appealing for the building owners. Thus, subsidizing should be dedicated to refurbishment strategies instead of energy. Also, widespread governmental supported programs should be administrated to educate and improve awareness, especially in low-income areas.

TI  - Feasibility Study of a Centralised Electrically Driven Air Source Heat Pump Water Heater to Face Energy Poverty in Block Dwellings in Madrid (Spain)
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Energy poverty can be defined as the inability to pay the bills that are required for maintaining the comfort conditions (usually in winter) in dwellings. The use of energy efficient systems is one way forward to mitigate this problem, with one option being the electrically driven air source heat pump water heater. This paper assesses the performance of a centralised heat pump (200 kW of heating capacity) to meet the space heating demand of block dwellings in Madrid (tier four out of five in winter severity in Spain). Two models have been developed to obtain the following variables: the hourly thermal energy demand and the off-design heat pump performance. The proposed heat pump is driven by a motor with variable rotational speed to modulate the heating capacity in an efficient way. A back-up system is also considered to meet the peak demand. A levelised cost of heating of 92.22 Euro/MWh is obtained for a middle-level energy efficiency in housing (class E, close to D). Moreover, the following energy-environmental parameters have been achieved: more than 74% share of renewable energy in primary energy and 131.7 g CO2 avoided per kWh met. A reduction of 60% in the heating cost per dwelling is obtained if an energy retrofit is carried out, improving the energy performance class from E to C. These results prove that the proposed technology is among the most promising measures for addressing energy poverty in vulnerable households.

TI  - How Energy Retrofit Maintenance Affects Residential Buildings Market Value?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - By now, it is clear the built environment could play an important role in fighting climate change, since it accounts for around 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions. Generally speaking, Italian residential stock is over 50 years old and around 16% of that needs large interventions due to its poor maintenance condition. So, the maintenance in this context can play a pivotal role in acheiving both energy efficiency and asset valorization. Introduced by a reference framework for the question in the title, this paper presents the case study: a portion of a working-class neighborhoods near the metropolitan city of Turin, marked by very recurrent typologies for the period (early seventies). The local real estate market is discussed to investigate the extraordinary maintenance impact on the property values: the paper considers the market value increase due to the energy class upgrade and the external look improvement. Individual owners putting money on this group of works get a very cost-effective investment and take advantage of Italian legislation supporting these kinds of interventions: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and in turn greater than the cost assumed for the renovation work.

TI  - Conveyance, envy, and homeowner choice of appliances
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Conveyance, i.e. the fact that an appliance purchased will be left in a dwelling when moving out, may lead homeowners to purchase appliances of lower quality or performance, because the extra costs are not entirely capitalized into the house sales price. Employing a discrete choice experiment with homeowners in the United States, this paper explores the effects of conveyance on homeowners' willingness-to-pay for various attributes of refrigerators. To account for the social nature of purchases when conveyance is likely to occur, it also tests the role of envy (elicited through an incentivized game). The findings provide evidence that conveyors are more likely than non-conveyors to purchase a smaller refrigerator, from a less well-known brand, and with lower customer ratings. In contrast, conveyance was not found to affect homeowners' choices when it comes to energy cost. In addition, envy was found to generally reinforce the negative effects of conveyance on homeowners' willingness-to-pay for several quality and performance attributes. While conveyance and its interaction with envy help explain why some homeowners choose certain quality/performance attributes of appliances, these factors do not appear to explain the energy efficiency paradox.

TI  - An exploratory investigation into the relationship between energy performance certificates and sales price: a polytomous universal model approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF PROPERTY AND CONSTRUCTION
AB  - Purpose
   The role of energy efficiency and particularly energy performance certificates (EPCs) has emerged as a topical and important aspect of real estate markets. Various studies have been carried out investigating the perceived capitalisation effects of energy efficiency on property prices. There, however, remains divergence of opinion whether the capitalisation effect is truly in existence with extant research showing differing magnitudes of effects, if any. To date, no study (that the authors are aware of) has investigated the nature of the transition between EPC bands and price effects. The purpose of this study is to add to the research of the energy efficiency of housing to examine the nature of the likelihood of property characteristics being associated with higher EPC scores and value.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This research undertakes a suite of methodological tests to investigate the more latent relationships between EPC bands and pricing behaviour using 3,797 achieved sales prices within the Belfast housing market. Binary logit regression models are specified in conjunction with a Polytomous Universal Model to examine the likelihood of EPC bands falling within a particular property type and the likelihood of any pricing effects.
   Findings
   The findings show the differing property types to comprise very distinct and complex relationships in terms of price and EPC banding. The binary logit model estimations for both terrace properties and apartments reveal an increased likelihood to obtain higher EPC scores, with the semi-detached sector displaying a "mixed effect" with detached property revealing decreased probability of having superior energy performance and decreased likelihood of having poorer energy performance. The ordinal model estimations indicate that sales price comprises no relationship with energy performance, inferring that there is no increased probability of an increase in sales price with higher EPC rating.
   Originality/value
   This research offers new insights and focus on achieving a better understanding of the nexus between energy performance and property characteristics using alternative modelling approaches. This provides more exploratory insights into the complex relationships and offers awareness for policy discourse in terms of targeting properties which will tend to be poorer in energy efficiency.

TI  - The capitalization of energy efficiency: Evidence from the housing market
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates how private consumers capitalize energy efficiency in the housing market, and the extent to which the provision of an energy performance certificate (EPC) affects such capitalization. We explicitly address methodological lacunae in the literature, using an exhaustive battery of identification strategies. The results indicate that energy efficiency is indeed capitalized into home prices, with OLS estimates biased downwards. Using an IV approach, we find that as the level of energy efficiency increases by ten percent, the market value of the dwelling increases by around 2.2 percent - quite a precise reflection of both the required capital outlay and future energy savings. These results are confirmed in a repeat-sales analysis. Importantly, examining the role of energy performance certificates (EPCs), we document that the extent of capitalization of energy efficiency is not affected by information provision, questioning the continued need for government-imposed certification programs.

TI  - Designing a decision support system to evaluate the environmental and extra-economic performances of a nearly zero-energy building
T2  - SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Purpose The cost-optimal analysis is not able to address the multi-dimensionality of the decision according to the new European objectives and International sustainable development goals in the field of the nearly-zero energy building (NZEB) design. The purpose of this paper is to study the role of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) for guiding energy investment decisions. Design/methodology/approach The paper explores the Preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations II (PROMETHEE II) application to support the project of transforming a rural building into a NZEB. The evaluation provides an estimate of the effects of alternative energy efficiency measures, involving energy consumption, life cycle costs, carbon emissions, property value and indoor comfort criteria. The study performs a multi-actors analysis in order to understand how different consumers' point of views can influence the final choice of the best investment. Furthermore, a multi-site analysis explores the spatial variation of NZEB building appreciation in the real estate market. Findings The PROMETHEE II-based model ranks 16 alternative solutions for the NZEB according to energy, economic and extra-economic criteria. The multi-actors analysis highlights the configuration of the NZEB building that best meets the needs of different end-users, respecting the European directives and national standards. The multi-site analysis concludes that location does not change users' appreciation and not influence the output for the best solution. Originality/value The MCDA occurs as a support tool that helps to optimize the preliminary design phase of NZEB through the exploration of the optimal solution considering crucial criteria in the energy and environmental and real estate market rules.

TI  - Decarbonising real estate The evolving relationship between energy efficiency and housing in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose
   About 27 per cent of the total UK carbon emissions are attributed to residential buildings; therefore, improvements to the energy efficiency of the stock offers great potential. There are three main ways to achieve this. First is a mandatory approach, minimum energy efficiency standards are set and applied to new and existing buildings. Option 2 is voluntary, using energy ratings that classify performance to stimulate awareness and action. Third, financial measures, incentives and taxes, are applied to "nudge" behaviours. Most westernised countries have adopted a combination of Options 2 and 3, with the belief that the market will incentivize efficient properties. The belief is voluntary measures will stimulate demand, leading to value premiums. This paper aims to seek a deeper understanding of the relationship between energy efficiency and the value of residential property in Europe and, by so doing, to determine whether stronger policies are required to realise decarbonisation.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper reviews the current academic literature and large-scale quantitative studies conducted in Europe, mostly using hedonic pricing analysis to seek a relationship between energy performance certificates (EPCs) and either capital or rental values. It compares these to the reported findings of three case study projects that take a variety of different research approaches, all of which have the ambition to understand market behaviours and stimulate occupier or/and owner demand for energy efficient buildings.
   Findings
   The large-scale academic study results generally show a positive relationship between observed market prices and EPCs, which are commonly taken as surrogates for efficiency; however, outcomes are variable. One large study found energy upgrades may increase value, but not to the point where costs outweigh the value gain. Other studies found high returns on investment in energy efficiency technologies. The case study projects, however, revealed a more nuanced set of arguments in terms of the relationship between energy efficiency and market behaviours. Whilst there is some evidence that energy efficiency is beginning to impact on value, it is small compared to other value drivers; other drivers, including health, well-being and private sector finance deals, may prove more powerful market drivers. Further, the empirical findings reported point towards the emergence of a "brown" discount being more likely to be the long-term trend than a green premium. It is concluded that the current levels of action are unlikely to deliver the levels of decarbonisation urgently needed.
   Research limitations/implications - This is a desktop study of other European studies that may have collected data on slightly different variables. Practical implications - This study shows that more action is required to realise decarbonisation in new and existing residential property in the European states considered. The sector offers potential for substantial reductions, and other mandatory approaches need to be considered.
   Originality/value
   This is a timely review of the current outcomes of European programmes (EPCs) adopted in several countries to increase energy efficiency in the residential sector through a voluntary mechanism. The results show that more action is needed.

TI  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY, THE OVERLOOKED CLIMATE EMERGENCY SOLUTION
T2  - EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA
AB  - Policies, especially in the European Union, encourage government and privately funded programs to engage in "energy efficiency first" strategies. Those policies lead to the moderation of energy demand and are long-term solutions that not only protect households from price fluctuations and energy poverty, but also allow people to reduce their environmental footprint and save money in the long term. Energy poverty usually occurs when a household is unable to secure a level and quality of domestic energy services-space cooling and heating, cooking, appliances, information technology etc.-sufficient for its social and material needs. In the Global North, energy poverty is generally attributed to internal and external factors such as low incomes, energy-inefficient homes and high energy prices, while in the Global South, the infrastructural lack of access to more technologically advanced energy carriers is the main culprit. Energy poverty in developing countries is gaining interest thanks to the seventh Sustainable Development Goal: Affordable and clean energy. Still, so far, in the European Union and in the rest of the world, little has been done to sew together the two concepts and include the most vulnerable part of the population in an approach that reconciles environmental and climate risks with social issues. In practice, energy poverty and efficiency agendas are rarely coordinated. Energy efficiency and a better pooling of the resources (known also as "sufficiency") could lead to higher resiliency to the social and climate crisis.

TI  - Carbon tax and energy programs for buildings: Rivals or allies?
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Carbon tax is among the most intensively discussed topics in energy research and policy nowadays, but the question of using carbon tax revenue for environmental and energy policy purposes has received little attention so far. Currently the revenue generated from carbon tax has different usage in the countries worldwide, with only one quarter used for environmental and sustainable energy purposes. Against this background we study whether it can be advisable to use carbon tax revenue for financing energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) programs. Based on the case study of Switzerland, we demonstrate that such a policy approach could not only allow to achieve additional reduction of CO2 emissions, but also considerable net benefits to household sector with regard to reduction of heating costs, while having rather low program costs for individual households.

TI  - A Review of the Impact of Green Building Certification on the Cash Flows and Values of Commercial Properties
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study aims to review empirical research concerning the impact of green certificates on property cash flows and values, particularly from professional property investors' perspective. The study uses discounted cash flows (DCF), a widely used property valuation method in income-generating properties, as a methodological framework. In this study, over 70 peer-reviewed studies were identified, categorized, and analyzed in the DCF framework. The reviewed studies indicated that certificates might increase the rental income and decrease the operating expenses, vacancy, and risks of a property. Together with the brand value of certificates, these enhancements should lead to an increase in property value. The number of studies has grown rapidly during the 2010s. Lately, studies have developed from asset-level to portfolio-level examinations. Although the reviewed studies found certification to be beneficial, the range of reported benefits was wide, and over half of the studies concentrated on U.S. commercial real estate markets, with a strong focus on LEED and ENERGY STAR certificates. From a property valuation perspective, applying these results to other markets and certificates might be challenging. Property values that fully reflect the environmental performance of properties would be a key to motivate mainstream investors to adopt sustainable property features.

TI  - Research on Green Productivity of Chinese Real Estate Companies-Based on SBM-DEA and TOBIT Models
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Apart from promoting social-economic development and increasing social employment, the real estate industry in China has also brought up problems such as high energy consumption and high emissions. Scholars now focus more on energy conservation, emission reduction and sustainable development of real estate companies in their current research. The data used by this paper are three-year panel data from 2015 to 2018, with observations from 15 representative real estate companies. CO2 and green credit index are introduced as the undesirable output and the green output of real estate companies respectively. First, with the DEA model and the Malmquist index model, this paper evaluates the green productivity of real estate companies statically and dynamically. The Tobit model is then employed by the author to analyze factors that may affect green productivity. Our results indicate that (1) the green productivities of 15 Chinese real estate companies have improved by various degrees. The average green productivity rises from 0.701 in 2015 to 0.849 in 2018, indicating that the energy utilization rate of enterprises has gradually increased. From the calculation and decomposition of the Malmquist total factor productivity index, we know that technological progress is vital in improving the green productivity of real estate companies. (2) As for the influencing factors, the green productivity is positively related to factors such as policy compliance indicator P, environmental responsibility commitment indicator R, indicator of green innovation capability I, and indicator of green development information disclosure M. The asset-liability ratio on the contrary has a negative impact on green productivity. It's worth to point out that the green innovation index and green productivity is significantly correlated and the correlation coefficient can be up to 0.636, which implies that the key to improving green productivity is to increase research and development investment.

TI  - Impact of energy benchmarking and disclosure policy on office buildings
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Building energy benchmarking policies require owners to publicly disclose their building's energy performance. In the US, the adoption of such policies is contributing to an increased awareness among tenants and buyers and is expected to motivate the owners of less efficient buildings to invest in energy efficiency improvements. However, there is a lack of studies specifically aimed at investigating the impact of such policies on office buildings among major cities through quantitative analyses. In response, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the benchmarking policy on energy efficiency improvements decision-making and on real estate performances, by applying two interrupted time series analyses to office buildings in downtown Chicago. The initial results indicate a lack of statistically strong evidence that the policy affected the annual vacancy trend of the energy efficient buildings (represented by ENERGY STAR labeled buildings). However, the use of interrupted time series in a more in-depth analysis shows that the policy is associated with a 6.7% decrease in vacancy among energy efficient buildings. The study proposed a method to quantitatively evaluate the impact of energy policies on the real estate performance of office buildings, and the result confirms the positive impact of energy-efficient retrofits on the real estate performance. The study findings support the reasoning behind the owners' decision in implementing energy efficiency improvements in their office buildings to remain competitive in the market.

TI  - Residential building stock model for evaluating energy retrofit programs in Saudi Arabia
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - This paper describes the development of a residential building stock model for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia using an engineering bottom-up approach. The model is suitable for evaluating the impact of any energy efficiency or demand-side management program targeted for the residential building sector. The model accounts for the make-up and the characteristics of the existing Saudi housing stock using 54 prototypes representing KSA residential buildings including their type, vintage, and location. The model relies on a detailed building simulation tool to predict hourly energy consumption. The model predictions have been verified against actual reported data for energy consumption levels associated to main four Saudi regions. As an application of the building stock model, the benefits of a series of energy retrofit measures and programs are evaluated for both households and Saudi government. The analysis results clearly indicate that large-scale implementation of retrofit programs for existing KSA housing stock is cost-effective and has a wide range of economic, environmental, and social benefits. In particular, a full and targeted implementation of optimal retrofit programs can reduce the annual electricity consumption of the KSA residential sector by 50% in addition to similar decreases in carbon emissions and electricity generation capacities. The analysis results clearly indicate that for the retrofit program to be effective, the energy efficiency measures need to be tailored to the housing type, vintage, and location. Optimal sets of retrofit measures have been identified for the various categories of KSA housing stock as part of the based analysis carried out in this study. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Sustainable energy efficiency retrofits as residenial buildings move towards nearly zero energy building (NZEB) standards
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - 1.9 million housing units in Ireland are required to be retrofitted for the existing Irish national housing stock to be considered nearly zero energy building (nZEB). This paper assesses optimum retrofit packages aimed at improving the building material thermal efficiencies and energy demand of gas-heated semidetached and end-terraced houses in Ireland. The cost-optimal methodology framework for calculating cost optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and building elements is used to determine the optimum retrofit packages from both a householder perspective and a societal perspective.
   The results of the cost-optimal approach are compared to the results from a weighted framework approach which incorporates life cycle effective. The results found that the ranking of energy efficiency retrofit designs based on multiple life cycle environmental and cost indicators differ compared to cost optimum designs based on only life cycle energy and cost indicators. The cost-optimal approach was found to be effective for identifying retrofit packages that are among the best packages even without accounting for multiple environmental indicators. However, once multiple indicators were considered, the hierarchy of the optimal retrofit packages changed. In the Irish context, the environmental impact of the Irish electricity grid was found to play a significant role in the hierarchy of the retrofit packages examined.
   While the cost-optimal method should not be relied on solely for identifying the optimum retrofit package solution, it could be employed as part of the multistage assessment methodology for narrowing down design solution sample sizes. Using the remaining array of retrofit packages solutions, the optimum retrofit package could be identified using multiple indicators. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Demand-side management in residential community realizing sharing economy with bidirectional PEV while additionally considering commercial area
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER & ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB  - In smart grids, demand-side management (DSM) is one of the important mechanism since it can reduce the total electricity cost of each customer, meanwhile alleviates the aggregate peak-to-average ratio (PAR) subject to real-time pricing (RTP) policy. On the other hand, with the growth of bidirectional charging/discharging Plug-in Electric vehicles (PEV), the capability of storing electrical energy for load shifting and energy sharing among users may take smart grid to a next level. In the viewpoint of a community, we design a fairness strategy and apply particle swarm optimization (PSO) to get the near optimal sharing schedule within community and share PEV's battery with neighbors to reduce the total electricity cost and peak-to-average ratio (PAR). On the other hand, we try to utilize the PEVs which park at the commercial building during working hour to be involved with part of the building's power consumption. In the simulation, we have collected ten daily activity profiles from ten different people to represent the residents in the community and use the hourly load profile data from the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE) for a commercial sector. The results show that the proposed DSM system not only reduces the electricity cost for each household but also reduces the PAR of the community. Moreover, for the commercial building, the proper rearrangement of PEVs' behavior also helps to reduce the total electricity cost and PAR.

TI  - AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF ENERGY INTENSITY ON THE MARKET VALUE OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS ON THE EXAMPLE OF SELECTED BUILDINGS IN SZCZECIN
T2  - REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION
AB  - Environmental requirements, constantly increasing energy prices as well as energy consumption by residential units and buildings have become an important factor in the decision-making processes in the real estate market. The preferences of residential unit buyers who recognize the problem of energy intensity and translate it into the transaction price have also been changing. However, amendments to the Act on real estate management and new European standards have imposed an obligation to include the certificates of energy performance of buildings and premises on real estate valuers in the valuation process. In this paper, energy intensity understood as the heating requirements of multi-family residential buildings is the basis for assessing the impact of the proposed variants on the market value of residential units. The paper analyzes the energy intensity of various types of buildings (e.g. in low and high buildings) and its impact on the market value of residential units in a selected housing estate in Szczecin, when the property valuer has access to energy performance certificates of neither the unit under valuation nor the units selected for comparison. The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the energy intensity and the market value of residential units. The proposed three models of real estate market value: non-classical, multiple regression and average price adjustment taking into account energy intensity, obtain results consistent with the actual transaction price at a satisfactory level. The assessment was made using standard deviation, a coefficient of variation and the average error of forecasts.

TI  - An Experimental Study of the Effect of Energy Label Design on the Correct Evaluation of Buildings' Energy Performance and Promotion of Energy Saving
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REAL ESTATE REVIEW
AB  - Many countries have implemented an energy labeling system that displays the energy savings performance of buildings. However, previous studies have reported mixed findings on the effectiveness of this system.
   This study is undertaken in Japan to assess whether energy labels are effective and validate the significance of the label design. We use an online survey to determine the effects of energy labels on target consumers. We choose two energy label designs: one with a stairs rating form design and the second with a rating scale of the energy efficiency. Adopting a within-subjects method, each respondent shown both designs and asked to evaluate the energy-saving level based on the labels. Cross-tabulation confirms the positive effects of labeling on energy-savings levels, which are amplified by increasing the level of the reference point. The highest insulation performance level in Japan complies with a law enacted back in 1993; the results show that greater effects can be realized by increasing the level of the reference point.
   A logistic regression analysis shows that energy labels with the stairs rating have a negative influence, while labels with a rating scale are preferred based on ease of understanding by the respondents. This suggests that energy labels that offer a rating scale can contribute to facilitating energy savings, although there are problems with the comprehension of the gradation colors which need to be further examined. These results can act as a guideline towards optimal designs of the upcoming task of modifying the energy labeling system in Japan.

TI  - Energy efficiency as a credence good: A review of informational barriers to energy savings in the building sector
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Information problems have early been suspected to be the main barrier to energy-efficiency investment. I review the vast yet piecemeal research that has been carried out since. Focusing on energy efficiency in buildings, I organize the review around the concept of credence good: just like that of auto repairs or taxi rides, the quality of energy-efficiency measures is never fully revealed to the buyer; as a result, it is subject tomultiple information asymmetries. My first contribution is to distinguish symmetric-information problems from information asymmetries. The former arise when information is either incomplete or imperfect, but equally shared by contracting parties; as non-market failures, these can be addressed by technological progress and insurance markets. My second contribution is to give structure to the information asymmetries associated with energy efficiency by disentangling screening, signalling, moral hazard and price discrimination within a variety of contractual relationships involving buyers and sellers, owners and renters, borrowers and lenders, and regulators and policy stakeholders. I find evidence of information asymmetries to be compelling in utility-included rental contracts, unclear in home sales and rentals, and scarce in retrofit contracting and financing. I conclude by discussing the intricacies between informational and behavioural problems in energy-efficiency decisions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Even though a shared identification of energy poverty is not yet agreed, this phenomenon has been recognized as an EU priority. Several EU legislative documents address the topic, trying to outline its boundaries and provide a framework for mitigative actions. At the same time, different research and demonstration projects have been funded to experiment and evaluate innovative approaches, strategies, and solutions and to promote good practices at national, regional, and local levels. This review paper presents some results of the "ZOOM" project ("Energy zoning for urban systems. Models and relations for the built environment", funded by University of Bologna in the framework of Alma Idea 2017-ongoing), proposing a critical overview of the EU projects directly or indirectly connected to energy poverty-funded under the 7th Framework Program (FP7) and under Horizon 2020 Program (H2020). The aim of such a review is to highlight the main objectives, trends, and related topics of ongoing and concluded projects addressing energy poverty, in order to identify gaps and open issues and to understand the possible orientation and placement of this subject in the future EU research and innovation framework project, Horizon Europe.

TI  - Simulation of indoor and outdoor air quality and health impacts following installation of energy-efficient retrofits in a multifamily housing unit
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Efforts to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the United States have led to widespread interest in energy-efficient retrofits in the residential sector. Weatherization retrofits, such as air sealing and insulation, lower residential energy consumption, resulting in reduced fuel and electricity-related emissions, improved ambient air quality, and avoided climate and health impacts. However, retrofits without adequate ventilation may worsen indoor air quality (IAQ) and lead to adverse health effects and costs that offset anticipated economic benefits. Building energy management and climate action plans often omit these potential consequences. This study presents a novel framework that quantifies health and energy costs and benefits related to residential energy-efficient retrofits. Energy savings from reduced consumption were estimated using historical energy prices. Reductions in ambient emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) precursors were translated to avoided health impacts using health damage functions. Indoor PM2.5-related health impacts were estimated by applying PM2.5 concentration-response functions to changes in IAQ. Health impacts were monetized using health impact assessment techniques and compared to retrofit-related savings. For a modeled gas-heated midrise multifamily building in Boston, MA, weatherization retrofits without ventilation or filtration retrofits led to household health costs that far exceeded energy savings and population-level health savings, given increases in indoor PM2.5 concentrations (3.1 mu g/m(3) and 20.4 mu g/m(3) for standard and high-performance retrofits, respectively). In contrast, weatherization coupled with ventilation and filtration retrofits resulted in large savings. Overall, this study reinforces the need to quantify residential health impacts in assessments of energy-efficient retrofits.

TI  - REAL ESTATE SECTOR IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IN MAJOR POLISH
T2  - REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT AND VALUATION
AB  - This paper aims to review subject-matter literature and analyse the development policy documents of major Polish cities addressing the issue of climate change adaptation (urban adaptation plans, Polish abbr. MPA) and concerning the real estate sector; it is also an attempt to draw conclusions and identify potential benefits and challenges that the construction sector is currently facing. The literature focuses on coastal real estate, costs, benefits and barriers in the adaptation of buildings. MPAs point to the significant role of the real estate sector in adapting to climate change. Soft and hard instruments are becoming increasingly important in MPA. These are spatial planning (building restrictions in hazardous areas, use of green roofs in investments), a system of incentives for investors to promote adaptation activities, ecological education, investments in improving the energy efficiency of buildings. Also identified are the benefits to the real estate sector, e.g. the growing importance of occupations on the real estate market, the development of innovations and increased access to cheaper services and technologies. In Polish cities, high-intensity residential areas are characterized by high sensitivity. MPAs will strengthen the resilience of the city's technical infrastructure and public space, as well as develop blue and green infrastructure, which may translate into the increased resilience of real estate.

TI  - Measuring the price premium of energy efficiency: A two-step analysis in the Italian housing market
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Decarbonizing the building sector by means of the smart interconnection of increasingly efficient buildings is one of the European Union's goals in order to meet its climate and energy targets and a milestone in delivering future positive-energy cities. Energy performance certificates today, and smart readiness indicators tomorrow should positively influence consumers' choices and orient them towards an appreciation of sustainable buildings. Although energy performance certificates are now required by law in the EU Member States, it remains to be seen whether and how local real estate markets react to them. To fill this gap, we analyzed a cross-sectional housing dataset in the Italian city of Bolzano, which serves as a noteworthy case study due to its compact urban form and the environmental awareness of its local society. We first tested a hedonic price model, and then its spatial specification. Considering the certified energy efficiency performance and the characteristics of the location among the explanatory variables, we found a price premium in excess of 6% on moving from the worst ("G") to the best ("A") energy efficiency class, all other characteristics being equal. The presence of a spillover effect to nearby properties can also be framed as an additional co-benefit of retrofitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Innovation Technology Implementation in Facility Services in Russia
T2  - TURISMO-ESTUDOS E PRATICAS
AB  - The main function of building envelope is to protect people who live in the building from climatic effects by providing a comfortable microclimate and lighting in the house. Most residential multi-apartment buildings in the Russian Federation were built before mid-1990s with low energy efficiency and, often, low quality. The situation is aggravated by the lack of timely repair, which adversely affects the performance of these buildings. The sphere of individual housing construction also lacks of quality control at all stages of the life cycle of a building. Builders ignore important features of the building design, or the construction works are carried out by unqualified workers, without sufficient quality control. This results in increased energy consumption during the operation of the building, compromised microclimate in the house, violation of environmental requirements, and, in the absence of timely repairs, loss of the bearing capacity of the structural elements of the building. Important areas of development in the field of housing construction are to energy efficiency, improvement of the system of operation and maintenance of buildings, transparency in the operational performance of buildings for owners and investors. To obtain such benefits, it is necessary to develop a strategy for implementation of intelligent technologies and smart engineering systems to improve energy efficiency, automate operational processes and create an 'intelligent' profile of a building. The article presents a study of energy efficiency of buildings and justifies smart management of real estate objects, in order to save resources and timely respond to the decline in their operational qualities. In the modern conditions of market economy, when most of the housing stock is privately owned, it is necessary to create a modern economic and organizational mechanism for overhauls, reconstruction and modernization of building with the use of BIM technologies. The result of the overhaul and reconstruction works is the restoration and improvement of the operational characteristics of buildings. An overhaul or a reconstruction is advisable if the technical condition of the building has been compromised and effective operation and maintenance are impossible. The proposed methodological and practical recommendations aim at implementing the organizational and economic mechanism for managing the quality of overhauls, reconstruction and modernization of real estate objects, meet the emerging need for developing practical measures to revitalize the activities in the housing market and to improve the quality life of the population.

TI  - Energy poverty goes south? Understanding the costs of energy poverty with the index of vulnerable homes in Spain
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - In southern European countries, despite having mild winters, many people live in cold and energy-inefficient properties and struggle to meet their energy needs for comfort and warmth, and therefore they run the risk of developing cold-related illnesses. Although the relationship between health, energy poverty, and cold/warm homes has been analysed by numerous studies, the identification of the direct impact of this relationship on society remains elusive in these countries. This paper shows a case study in a working-class district of Seville, Spain. Six multi-family residential buildings (providing social housing for a total of seventy-one households), built prior to energy-efficiency regulations being in place, are retrofitted by Seville City Council. The Index of Vulnerable Homes, defined by the authors, assesses the vulnerability to energy poverty (pre- and post-intervention) of those households. Furthermore, the costs to the National Health Service (NHS) are also estimated. The results show that savings for the NHS could be used in order to define the payback period of those retrofitting funds. In conclusion, this paper presents how the Index of Vulnerable Homes would be able to help in the development of a comprehensive and coordinated strategy in social housing to address energy poverty, and in the monitoring of the effectiveness of ongoing projects in the city of Seville.

TI  - Energy Efficiency Information and Valuation Practices in Rental Housing
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
CP  - Symposium on Real Estate Valuation
AB  - The consensus in the academic literature is that energy efficiency is associated with transaction value premiums, but it is not clear to what extent property appraisers take account of this. We decompose external appraisals of rental housing by international valuation firms in England and the Netherlands in two waves, keeping the samples of valued homes constant between these years. We find a notable change in the behavior of external property appraisers. In England, energy performance does not impact assessed values in 2012, while estimation results for 2015 show a significant discount in assessed values for D-, E- and F- relative to C-labeled dwellings. For the Netherlands, we do not observe a significant relationship between energy efficiency and assessed values in 2010, but in 2015 we find that more energy efficiency leads to higher external valuations.

TI  - On the use of hedonic regression models to measure the effect of energy efficiency on residential property transaction prices: Evidence for Portugal and selected data issues
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Using a unique dataset of 256,000 residential property sales for Portugal, this paper reveals a clear sales premium for energy efficiency, which is more pronounced for apartments (13%) than for houses (5 to 6%). Price premiums tend to increase from 2009 to 2013, a period in which the Portuguese housing market was depressed. Quantile regression reveals that, when compared with the rest of the sample, the group of the most energy efficient properties receives a statistically relevant price premium, that is mostly stable across the entire spectrum of the conditional price distribution. Cross-country comparisons suggest that energy efficiency price premiums are higher than those found for central and northern European markets. Illustrations on the effect of data issues in hedonic regression models are provided. They show how the use of appraisal prices and explanatory variables with measurement errors may seriously bias energy efficiency partial effect estimates. In contrast, the omission of variables associated with the quality of the properties has not produced relevant distortions. Finally, it became apparent that the use of smaller datasets would have produced similar results, as no significance inflation was produced by the Portuguese large scale dataset.

TI  - Is there an economic case for energy-efficient dwellings in the UK private rental market?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The rented sector of the housing market is a key concern for policies trying to improve dwelling-level energy efficiency levels. Currently, stepping up energy efficiency levels in the residential sector is hindered by a number of uncertainties. For rental properties, this is complicated by the split incentive problem (i.e. landlords do not benefit directly from the savings arising from these investments). Instead, the benefits are enjoyed by the tenants of these upgraded properties via lower energy bills and/or enhanced thermal comfort. Hence, the only way to recoup the investments is typically for landlords to obtain higher rents. This study confirms that energy efficiency features, as measured by the Energy Performance Certificate rating, are positively associated with a small but significant influence on transaction prices and quoted rental prices. Conversely, there appears to be a price discount for dwellings in the lowest energy performance category. A model of time-on-market yields inconclusive results but there is some, albeit weak, evidence of a negative relationship between time-on-market and energy efficiency ratings as more energy efficient dwellings tend to lease up more quickly.

TI  - How much and why are we willing to pay for energy-efficient homes? A stated preferences analysis in Barcelona
T2  - ACE-ARCHITECTURE CITY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In the literature, the empirical evidence on the green premium for energy-efficient homes does not provide the reasons that produce such price increment. This paper, using stated preferences surveys, explores whether households in Barcelona are willing to pay (WTP) for an improvement in the ranking coming from Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) and the reasons explaining its variance. The results suggest that, in general, people are unaware of the EPC scheme, and tend to confound energy performance of homes with the overall architectonic quality. Such limitations reduce the WTP for efficient homes, while other perceptions such as comfort and an improved health condition associated with energy performance appear as positively correlated. Furthermore, the stratified analysis indicates the existence of divergent sensibilities associated with socioeconomic conditions. On the whole, it poses important challenges for the design of public policies aimed at fostering the diffusion of energy-efficient homes. The findings of this paper imply important challenges for the communication of the EPC policy in Spain, not only because society is not monolithic, having divergent motivations when bidding for efficient housing, but also because superficial information seems to be inefficient in creating awareness on the implication of the energy performance of buildings.

TI  - The Relevance of EPC Labels in the Spanish Residential Market: The Perspective of Real Estate Agents
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Assessment regarding the impact of Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) on the residential market is largely inconclusive; while the majority of hedonic analyses have found EPC ratings to be correlated with prices, opinion-based research has found a negligible impact on prices and other marketing variables. Using the opinion of qualified real estate agents, this paper explores whether, in Spain, EPC labels play any role in housing marketing, as well as the policy changes required to foster efficient dwellings. The results reveal a large misunderstanding of the EPC labels, since they are seen as a global home-quality indicator, while their impact on residential marketing is quite poor. Apparently, both supply and demand place a small interest in energy performance, although it is slightly larger for sellers/buyers in relation to lenders/tenants. In any case, EPC labels are far from blurring the energy information asymmetry, since most of the buyers/tenants are informed of the EPC rating after having selected their home. Overall, the EPC scheme has a poor reputation exacerbated by inaccuracies, unintelligible units to express the financial and environmental implications of energy efficiency, and an apparent weak supervision. These findings stress the need to improve the scheme; in doing so, realtors suggest the need for some companion policies.

TI  - Cost-benefit analysis to support decarbonization scenario for 2030: A case study in Italy
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Mitigation strategies towards progressive decarbonization of the energy system are a valid approach to slow environmental pollution yielding social benefits, as established from National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP). The first objective is the increase of energy efficiency within 2030 by promoting the use of renewable energy and the electrification of consumption in other sectors (household and transport). Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is an analytical tool to evaluate investments and support policy decisions for society's welfare. The paper aims to assess how CBA can be used to quantify the costs and related social benefits in different sectors (energy, transport and household) if the decarbonization scenario is applied in Italy in 2030. Overall, our findings show positive benefits obtained with the adoption of different mitigation strategies for all sectors. These results can provide significant support to decision-makers in the implementation of decarbonization scenario in Italy scheduled for 2030.

TI  - Green federal tax credits impact on US housing prices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to investigate whether increases in homeowner green amenities occurred because of income tax credits to the degree that changes in housing prices are measurable. Are higher incomes, lower mortgage rates and green income-tax credits impacting housing price changes?
   Design/methodology/approach
   The paper uses the least-squares regression model with natural log specifications. The log of income and a dummy variable, which was assigned to the Energy Policy Act (2005) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009) coverage dates are used as independent variables. Two regression models were examined using monthly housing price data from January 1990 through the year 2018. The first regression model used a single dummy variable for credits available under the Policy Act of 2005 and the Recovery Act of 2009. The second regression model considered the credits granted under these two laws separately. Disposable income per capita impacts demands for housing while green upgrade expenditures affect the cost of housing.
   Findings
   The laws set low credit limits of $500 followed by $1,500 but because of the multiplier effect, the spending appears to have magnified and been much higher. The credit availability variables have positive coefficients and were significant at 1 per cent. This implies that single-family housing prices were sensitive to the existence of residential energy property income-tax credits. The R-2 results were 0.93 or above for both models.
   Social implications
   The paper provides support for the idea that residential green amenity upgrades positively impact the value of a house. These green-amenity upgrades, which other research studies have suggested should be included explicitly in the appraisal process, are a major characteristic of a property when a price estimate is being done. Housing being sold should have a section on the information sheet noting the property green upgrades that exist and an energy efficiency score should be assigned to each house listed for sale.
   Originality/value
   There are few (if any) academic research papers studying the impact of green tax credits available under the Energy Policy Act (2005) and under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009). The degree to which green income-tax credits stimulate spending on housing has not been addressed by researchers. This paper is an initial research attempt to quantify whether these legislative efforts measurably encouraged homeowners to adopt newer, greener technologies.

TI  - Kouvola Housing fair NZEB houses energy, cost and carbon analyses
T2  - 12TH NORDIC SYMPOSIUM ON BUILDING PHYSICS (NSB 2020)
CP  - 12th Nordic Symposium on Building Physics (NSB)
AB  - Building energy efficiency, construction cost, life cycle cost, and carbon emission are the best interests of users, owners and different vendors. This study assessed the energy performance (EP) related investment and operational energy cost of Kouvola housing fair NZEB. Data from 12 new detached houses were collected, which fulfilled the energy certificate class of B according to the Finnish nearly zero energy building (NZEB) regulation. Besides, emission from building materials, construction and energy use during 50 years of one model building were estimated, aiming to compare the life cycle emission from wooden building, insulated concrete building, blockhouse and log house. The results showed that the total construction cost was independent to EP-value and even had a slightly negative correlation to the EP-value. The average EP-value of 12 buildings was slightly higher than that of buildings in Tampere housing fair 2012, which showed no improvement of nearly zero energy building (NZEB) guidelines since 2012. Energy performance related cost dependency in specific cost categories was shown so that EP-value improvement by 40 units increased less than 2% of construction cost. Electricity had a significant contribution to CO2 emission while local district heating was based on renewables. Material emissions contribution was 32-48% of total emissions, and wooden buildings showed lower carbon footprint compared to other building structures.

TI  - Modelling industrial energy demand in Saudi Arabia
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Between 1986 and 2016, industrial energy consumption in Saudi Arabia increased by tenfold, making it one of the largest end-use sectors in the Kingdom. Despite its importance, there appear to be no published econometric studies on aggregate industrial energy demand in Saudi Arabia. We model aggregate industrial energy demand in Saudi Arabia using Harvey's (1989) Structural Time Series Model, showing that it is both price and income inelastic, with estimated long-run elasticities of -0.34 and 0.60, respectively. The estimated underlying energy demand trend suggests improvements in energy efficiency starting from 2010.
   Applying decomposition analysis to the estimated econometric equation highlights the prominent roles of the activity effect (the growth in industrial value added) and the structure effect (the shift towards energy-intensive production) in driving industrial energy demand growth. Moreover, the decomposition shows how exogenous factors such as energy efficiency helped mitigate some of that growth, delivering cumulative savings of 6.8 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) between 2010 and 2016.
   Saudi Arabia implemented a broad energy price reform program in 2016, which raised electricity, fuel, and water prices for households and industry. The decomposition results reveal that, holding all else constant, higher industrial energy prices in 2016 reduced the sector's energy consumption by 6.9 %, a decrease of around 3.0 Mtoe. Saudi policymakers could therefore build on the current policy of energy price reform and energy efficiency standards to mitigate the rate of growth of industrial energy consumption, increase economic efficiency, and maintain industrial sector competitiveness.

TI  - The Power of Mandatory Quality Disclosure: Evidence from the German Housing Market
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
AB  - Numerous countries have introduced energy performance certificates to mitigate the information asymmetry with respect to the thermal quality of houses. Motivated by a stylized theoretical model and drawing on comprehensive data on real estate advertisements in the German housing market, this paper investigates the causal effect of disclosing energy information on the asking prices of houses. Employing within-variation from panel data, augmented by an instrumental variable approach to isolate effects among policy compliers, our analysis demonstrates the power of mandatory disclosure rules to increase market transparency and to align prices with the energy performance of the house. Among our key results, we find that house owners reduce offer prices in response to the disclosure of energy efficiency information. Furthermore, this effect is particularly pronounced for owners who would not disclose in the absence of the mandatory disclosure policy.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION (SBE19)
CP  - Conference on Sustainability in the Built Environment for Climate Change Mitigation (SBE)
AB  - The real estate sector is responsible for 40 percent of the energy consumption and one third of the CO2 emissions in Europe. Moreover one third of the European Union's buildings are in fact older than 50 years while only one percent is being renovated each year. The building stock is therefore of great importance for the European Union in order to achieve its climate targets not only for 2020 but also long term. The difficulty however is to decide where and how to realize energy savings in the most efficient and economical way - especially for property owners with a large and heterogeneous building stock. This paper provides a simplified analysis method to evaluate real estate portfolios and estimate their buildings' saving potential. This method has been integrated into AiBATROS (R)[1] software and can help to prioritize measures increasing energy efficiency. Verification and validation of the process are demonstrated comparing results with another method's energy calculations.

TI  - Analysis of the Impact of the Fireplace Heating on the Energy Performance of the Family House
T2  - PERIODICA POLYTECHNICA-MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Reduction of energy use in buildings is an important measure to achieve climate changes of mitigation. It is essential to minimize heat losses when designing energy efficient buildings. For energy efficient building in a cold climate, a large part of the space heating demand is caused by transmission losses through the building envelope. In compliance with the today's trend of designing sustainable and energy-saving architecture, it is necessary firstly to solve the factors influencing the energy balance. This year the subsidy for houses has been valued at sic 8,000. The condition is that the building is classified in the energy class A0 according to the Energy Performance Act. Energy class A0 characterizes nearly zero energy buildings. The main concern is for the public to become interested in such buildings. The subsidy is designed to reward and promote those buildings that their heat and technical characteristics and modern technical equipment that meet energy class. In addition to a good plan to raise the profile of such buildings, there has been a lot of speculation to help make buildings in energy class A0. They are mainly owners of family houses where there is no gasification and are forced to have electricity as a source of heat and hot water. Electricity has a high primary energy factor, which means that buildings do not have to be approved.

TI  - Bioactive Facade System Symbiosis as a Key for Eco-Beneficial Building Element
T2  - ENVIRONMENTALLY-BENIGN ENERGY SOLUTIONS
CP  - 7th Global Conference on Global Warming (GCGW)
AB  - The problems in today's built environment have a strong interrelation with key factors like pollution, global warming, energy and limited natural resources. When thinking of an ideal city the management of all these factors plays an important role in sustainability. Searching a magical solution to all these problems in this dynamic structure is not realistic, but some novel approaches like using the greenery (plants and microalgae) as bioactive elements adapted throughout the urban environment especially in the form of living facades on the buildings is getting more attention with regards to their eco-friendly potential. Bioactive facades can create a positive impact on managing some important parameters like thermal comfort, energy efficiency, wastewater recycle, CO2 capture and real estate price increase in microscale focusing on a single building aswell as global warming, pollution control, urban heat islands, social wealth and sustainable future in macroscale focusing on a big city. The aim of this review will be the key parameters for an efficient bioactive facade with regards to pros and cons, challenges and future. The review will cover the background of using plants as living walls or green walls and then will focus on the microalgae and photobioreactor adapted buildings.

TI  - The psychology of energy efficiency labels: Trust, involvement, and attitudes towards energy performance certificates in Ireland
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) aim to inform owners, occupiers, tenants, real estate agents and other relevant groups about the energy efficiency of buildings. Although house buyers and renters often recognize these certificates, they often do not use them. One explanation for this is lack of trust in these certificates. This paper presents the results of an online survey (n = 354), in which the role of perceived source credibility, trust in the certificate and people's involvement in energy efficiency was studied on renters' attitudes towards EPCs in Ireland, so-called BER labels. The results showed that trust is a key determinant for attitudes to EPCs, i.e., attitudes to EPCs become more positive when people trust them. However, how trust is used for the formation of attitudes depends on cognitive involvement (i.e., referring to information processing activities and the achievement of idealization states) and affective involvement (referring to feelings and achievements of certain emotional states). These two types of involvement moderate the effect of trust on attitudes to EPCs in different ways: high-cognitive involvement amplifies the effect of trust on attitudes, whereas high-affective involvement suppresses the effect of trust on attitudes. This has important theoretical implications, as both are often measured together. Equally important are the policy implications: we conclude that if trust levels are relatively high, policies focusing on increasing cognitive involvement are more likely to be effective, whereas if trust in EPCs is low, policy strategies should aim to enhance affective involvement.

TI  - Scheduling evaluation in construction projects using the critical chain project management method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATION IN ENGINEERING AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 2019 (ICIEVE 2019), PTS 1-4
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Innovation in Engineering and Vocational Education (ICIEVE)
AB  - PT. A is a company engaged in construction, EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction), infrastructure investment, property and real estate. The case study that was raised in this study was the construction project of the retaining wall and the ABC dock that was carried out by PT. A. The problem in the project is that the project scheduling is not good, causing delays in project completion. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the scheduling of the project so that the optimum schedule can be obtained in project implementation. The method used in this study is Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM). CCPM is a project scheduling method that can optimize the schedule due to the absence of multitasking. The CCPM begins by estimating the time without safeguarding the existing time on each job by using the Cut & Paste Method. The critical path serves to find out the critical or non-critical work or activity. Critical activities on wall construction projects anchoring land and ABC dock namely work keep directors. Based on buffer consumption monitoring indicators due to the potential for the emergence of waste will end in use of project buffer duration consumed during the 19-35 period day and immediately take action if the buffer is consumed in the period of 36-53 days. Based on evaluation with critical application Project chain management obtained one feeding 4-day buffer and duration of the buffer project 53 days with the existing scheduling period 432 days to 379 days without buffer consumption.

TI  - Heat transfer between heated, partially heated and non-heated residential units in buildings
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION (SBE19)
CP  - Conference on Sustainability in the Built Environment for Climate Change Mitigation (SBE)
AB  - Space heating cost allocation according to actual consumption can be one possible motivating factor for saving energy in residential and other buildings. As a consequence of the exclusion of a certain number of users in collective housing units from the central heating supply system in the city of Skopje, the problem of heating cost allocation and collection of the fixed part of the heat energy payment has arosen. The subject of the analysis in this study was the heat transfer in buildings, with the main focus on the issue of heat transfer rate between residential units with different internal temperatures, such as from heated to unheated or partly heated apartments in collective building objects. The purpose of the analysis was to assess the mutual energy interaction between the completely or partially excluded apartments from the central heating system and the adjacent apartments connected to the central heating system. This is done by simulating the thermal characteristics of typical buildings that are representatives of new (insulated) and old (un-insulated) buildings. For the simulation purposes, the external average daily and monthly temperatures were obtained based on the perennial outdoor temperatures measured in Skopje and additional series of input data that are characteristic for the city were used. For the value of the internal temperature in the dwellings the value for the standard internal design temperatures are predefined. As results of the simulation, values were obtained for the annual heat gains (in kWh/year) and the specific heat gains (in kWh/m(2)year) of the excluded apartments from the system of central heating through the enclosures (internal walls, ceiling and floor) of the adjacent apartments that are connected to the system for central heating and vertical hot water pipelines for an isolated and nonisolated buildings. In order to obtain a clearer picture, in the study are considered different configurations and positions of apartments in the building. As an indicator for each considered apartment, the ratio of the received thermal energy of the disconnected apartment to the required energy for its heating is calculated. Based on the obtained results, appropriate conclusions were drawn regarding the reduction of the necessary energy for heating of the excluded apartments, as a consequence of the thermal gains through the walls of the neighboring apartments that are connected to the heating system.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NINETEENTH INTERSOCIETY CONFERENCE ON THERMAL AND THERMOMECHANICAL PHENOMENA IN ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS (ITHERM 2020)
CP  - 19th IEEE Intersociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems (ITherm)
AB  - A data center cooling system consists of a hierarchy of systems with dedicated control algorithms dictating their operational states. There exists a wide range in spatial and temporal parameter space in an ensemble of non-linear dynamic systems, each executing a control task, while the global objective is to drive the overall system to an optimum operating condition i e minimum total operational power at desired rack inlet temperatures. Certainly, it is beneficial in optimizing workload migration at temporal scales but, solving the instability of the cooling systems operating at design points helps in understanding the whole system and make predictions to have better control strategies. Several techniques are available to realistically capture and make predictions. Data driven modelling/Machine learning is one such method that is less expensive in terms of cost and time compared to other methods like validated CFD simulation/experimental setup.
   The objective of this study is to develop a control framework based on predictions made using machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to operate multiple Computer Room Air Conditioning Units (CRAC) or simply Air-Cooling Units (ACU) in a hot-aisle contained raised floor datacenter. This paper focuses on the methodology of gathering training datasets from numerous CFD simulations (Scenarios) to train the ANN model and make predictions with minimal error.
   Each rack has a percentage of influence (zones) based on the placement of ACUs and their airflow behavior. These zones are mapped using steady state CFD simulation considering maximum CPU utilization and cooling provisioning. Using this map, ITE racks are targeted and given varying workload to force the corresponding ACU that is responsible for provisioning, to operate at set points. Number of such scenarios are simulated using the same CFD model with fixed bounds and constraints. Using large samples of data collected from CFD results, the ANN is trained to predict values that correspond to the activation of the desired ACU. Such efficient control network would minimize excessive cooling. The validated prediction points are used to model a control framework for the cooling system to quickly reach the operating point. These models can be used in real-time data centers provided; the training data is based on in-house sensor values.

TI  - Green housing transition in the Chinese housing market: A behavioural analysis of real estate enterprises
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The concept of green housing has been introduced in China to deal with climate issues in the housing sector. Green housing development requires a complex socio-technical transition based not just on green materials or technologies, but also, and most importantly, on the behavioural transition of housing market actors. Little is known about how Chinese real estate enterprises are responding to the green housing transition within a Chinese context. Addressing this gap, our research aims to determine whether, and to what, extent Chinese real estate enterprises are transitioning toward greener housing practices and what constraints may exist. This research gap is particularly pressing given the Chinese government's ambitions to promote energy efficiency in the new urban building sector by requiring 50% of urban new buildings to be green buildings by 2020 (NDRC, 2016). Our research reveals Chinese real estate enterprises face a dilemma of 'going green' and a range of institutional constraints that currently frustrate their uptake of green housing practices. Our research furthers knowledge on environmental and housing market governance within non-western and non-liberal contexts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Understanding citizen perspectives on open urban energy data through the development and testing of a community energy feedback system
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - With the rise of advanced and affordable sensors offering continuous monitoring of city infrastructure, cities are increasingly seeking to become more 'smart' and are adopting data-driven approaches to help meet sustainability goals. In the area of building energy efficiency, closely coupled with this effort is the prevalence of building energy benchmarking policies, which require public disclosure of vast new quantities of building-level energy data at urban scales (i.e., open urban energy data). While existing research efforts have focused on the potential of this data to transform energy efficiency markets and investments in the real estate sector, little research has been dedicated to assessing this information's value to the general public. Given that achieving energy reductions in the built environment will require not only energy efficiency investments, but also greater awareness, engagement, and action from ordinary citizens, we study the potential of open urban energy data in providing citizen benefits. Energy-cyber-physical systems offer a pertinent framework to link data from the virtual world to citizens' physical reality in order to improve their understanding and decision making. Adopting an energy-cyber-physical system perspective, we aim to connect open urban energy data to citizens through the development and evaluation of a novel community-scale energy feedback system. This mobile cyber-physical system transforms building-level electricity consumption and production data across Georgia Tech's campus into a mobile application consisting of three features: spatial feedback, energy supply feedback, and energy consumption feedback. Augmented-reality visualization elements are integrated into the system, providing Georgia Tech community members a direct link between their experienced physical environment and data stored in the virtual world. Applying a user-centered design approach, prospective users evaluate the system via thinking aloud sessions and user surveys to assess understandings and perceptions of open urban energy data for the Georgia Tech campus. The results contribute to literature seeking to create energy feedback systems at the community-scale and expand research investigating citizen reactions to and opinions of open urban energy data. This research is an integral step to further engagement and participation from the public to help achieve a sustainable and citizen-valued energy future.

TI  - A spatial analysis of EPCs in The Belfast Metropolitan Area housing market
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY RESEARCH
AB  - Energy performance remains a debated topic in real estate, particularly with reference to the capitalisation effect with property value. An emerging corpus of research studies have investigated the relationship between energy performance characteristics and the role of Energy Performance Certificates. Whilst these studies have consistently demonstrated that a pricing effect exists, some recent studies have shown that Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs)s are more complex and inconclusive, particularly when accounting for data limitations and changing model specifications. Moreover, a majority of these studies neglect to adequately account for absolute location and therefore, arguably, do not examine the geographic variation between EPCs and property value across the housing market setting. This study presents one of the first spatial analyses of EPCs using transactions for the Belfast Metropolitan Area. In evaluating whether spatial effects exist between EPCs and house prices, a number of spatial tests are performed and a series of models are developed to account for spatial dependency and determine whether there are any spatially correlating effects. The findings indicate that EPCs comprise a partial effect on house prices, and importantly, there are pricing differentials in the spatial variation in EPCs with the pricing effects conforming to both spatial clustering and randomness.

TI  - The relation of energy efficiency upgrades and cost of living, investigated in two cases of multi-residential buildings in the Netherlands
T2  - SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Purpose Decarbonising the housing stock is one of the largest challenges in the built environment today, which is getting the attention not only from policymakers but also from social housing corporations, financial organisations and users. In line with the international Paris-Climate-Change-Conference 2015, Dutch cities and housing associations have embraced this challenge with the ambitions to become carbon neutral in 2050. To reach such goals, both the rate and depth of renovation need to increase. Several technical solutions to eliminate the energy demand in dwelling have been developed and tested. Nevertheless, the intake rate of deep retrofitting is low. Despite recent developments, there are still significant barriers related to financing, lack of information and user acceptance. To address those barriers, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between energy efficiency upgrades and the cost of living. Design/methodology/approach Focusing on walk-up apartments in the Netherlands, a framework of refurbishment measures that affect the energy efficiency was identified, and their performance was calculated. Furthermore, the rental price adjustment was estimated, taking into account the refurbishment investment and the exploitation cost of the renovated dwellings. Findings The comparison of the energy use and rental price for the different options demonstrated how the different renovation measures affect the energy cost, the energy use, rent and cost of living. The tenants are more likely to accept the solutions that take into account the total cost of living and sustainability benefits. The study gives a holistic standpoint to the issue of energy upgrades, by quantifying the effect of the potential measures for the whole exploitation period. It has shown the potential of the different interventions to improve the performance and living conditions, without necessarily increasing the total cost of living. Originality/value The importance of the study is that it gives a holistic standpoint to the issue of energy upgrades, by quantifying the effect of the potential measures for the whole exploitation period. The cost, as a key, if not the more most decisive, issue, is put into perspective in relation to the benefit, in order to give a direction to the renovation design and arguments for the stakeholders' dialogue. The approach of the study goes beyond cost-optimality of measures and investigated the relation between energy upgrades and cost, as a way to evaluate design variation and address the lack of information barrier in renovations. Moreover, it also proves that deep renovation is feasible without increasing in the total cost of living, which is a principal argument to promote renovations.

TI  - Shared landscapes increase condominium unit selling price in a high-density city
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
AB  - High-density buildings can benefit city sustainability by reducing expansion into biodiverse and often public natural ecosystems, reducing travel-time to work-and-play and improving energy efficiency. However, city densification can also remove vegetation which provides ecosystem services that enhance resident's wellbeing. Some architects design shared landscapes on and around large-scale buildings which are excludable to the public, like private gardens, but can be rivalrous between residents, like parks. This potentially mitigates public vegetation and subsequent ecosystem service loss. However, little evidence exists on whether condominium unit buyers pay more for shared landscapes. To address this knowledge gap, we used the hedonic pricing method to explain condominium unit resale value with unbuilt and vegetated space, accounting for other price determinants, spatial and temporal random effects using a robust regression. Leaf area above 184 m(2) and unbuilt area (condominium estate area minus the building footprint) above 62.3 m(2) per person had significant positive effects on condominium unit selling price. This provides evidence that economic returns can be gained by having vegetation in accessible landscapes on and around buildings, should they be provided above a certain quantity. When supplied at more abundant quantities condominium estate vegetation also had a bigger effect than nearby managed parks, suggesting condominium unit buyers see more economic value in having nearer snore private vegetation. Planners and building developers should consider these effects when deciding whether to encourage vegetated landscapes at condominium estates, alongside how vegetation can provide other monetary and nonmonetary ecosystem services.

TI  - Metamodels to assess the thermal performance of naturally ventilated, low-cost houses in Brazil
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Building performance simulation [BPS] tools are important in all design stages. However, barriers such as time, resources, and expertise inhibit their use in the early design stages. This study aims to develop, as part of decision -support framework, metamodels to assess the thermal discomfort in a naturally ventilated Brazilian low-cost house during early design. The metamodels predict the degree -hours of discomfort by heat and/or by cold as a function of design parameters for three Brazilian cities: Curitiba, Sao Paulo, and Manaus. The key design parameters, related with passive design strategies, are building orientation, shading devices position and dimensions, thermal properties of the walls and roof, window-to-wall ratio, and effective window ventilation area. The method consists of three main stages: (i) baseline model development; (ii) Monte Carlo simulation; (iii) multivariate regression. Overall, the metamodels showed R-2 values higher than 0.95 for all climates, except the ones predicting discomfort by heat for Curitiba (R-2 =0.61) and Sao Paulo (R-2 =0.75). The proposed metamodels can quickly and accurately assess the thermal performance of naturally ventilated low-cost houses. They can be used to guide professionals during the early design stages, and for educational purposes in building design pedagogy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating climate and social housing policy to alleviate energy poverty: an analysis of targets and instruments in Austria
T2  - ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB  - Housing conditions are addressed by climate policy in retrofitting buildings and by social policy in providing affordable and adequate housing. Aim This paper illustrates intersections between both policy spheres in Austria and argues that disjunct policies undermine efforts at alleviating energy poverty. We identify conditions under which housing in Austria may lead to reduction in carbon emissions and inequality. Methods A concurrent triangulation design combines secondary data analysis, semi-structured expert interviews, and an in-depth analysis of legal documents. Results Energy poor and generally poor similarly live in low-quality and inefficient housing. Climate and social policy suffer from fragmented jurisdictions lacking inter-sectoral integration and do not accurately target the energy poor. Structural investments and the provision of affordable, adequate housing conflict due to the tenant/landlord dilemma. Implications Socio-economic conditions and housing market structures need to be incorporated in policy design. Inter-ministerial collaboration may mainstream the integration of climate and social policy.

TI  - Energy performance certification and time on the market
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper analyzes whether energy performance certificates (EPCs) serve as means to reduce the information asymmetry among market participants during the sale of homes. Using a sample of 876,000 single-family homes in the Netherlands, we examine the impact of EPC adoption on the speed of sale. Our results indicate that energy-rated homes sell faster than non-energy-rated homes, an effect that varies by 7-12 percent depending on model specifications and increases when positive (green) ratings are granted. The information conveyed by these certificates reduces the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers, which helps to reduce the uncertainty of quality. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Achieving housing energy-efficiency requirements: Methodologies and impacts on housing construction cost and energy performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - Energy-efficiency requirements defined by building codes have recently been updated in Canada to improve the energy performance of new homes. In this context, this paper proposes two methodologies that minimize the cost impact of updated building codes on current housing construction practices (i.e., (1) least additional construction cost (LACC) upgrades for building envelope to meet code-specified thermal resistance values (RSIcode), and (2) upgrade(s) which incur the LACC and meet code-specified energy consumption (ECcode)). To develop and demonstrate the proposed methodologies, a new single-family detached house in the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was used as a case study. The impacts of an energy code (i.e., the Alberta Building Code (ABC) 2014) on new housing are assessed in terms of total additional construction cost (T-Delta(CC)), energy consumption (EC), and operational cost (OP). The results indicate that the T(Delta)(CC )required to comply with the ABC 2014 and the energy performance (EP) of housing in Edmonton vary significantly depending on the code-compliance approach. Applying the proposed methodologies, LACC code-compliant upgrades can be effectively identified for other building locations.

TI  - Meta-Analysis of Price Premiums in Housing with Energy Performance Certificates (EPC)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Studies have found that housing with energy performance certificates have a positive premium in sales price. However, other studies have obtained negative or unexpected results. The objective of this study is to determine whether or not housing with energy performance certificates (EPC) have positive premiums in the sales price. For this purpose, a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of prior studies were conducted in order to determine whether the existence of an EPC influences sales price. A total of 66 documents were examined, with a total of 173 sales registers. The impact of having or not having an EPC was analyzed for housing sales price premiums on a global level, as well as the premiums in Europe for each of the ABCDEFG qualification letters. The results suggest that: 1) Globally speaking, it is estimated that housing with an EPC has an overall price premium of 4.20%, on a continent level, with premiums of 5.36% being obtained in North America, 4.81% in Asia, and 2.32% in Europe; 2) in Europe, the results are not conclusive with regards to the ABCDEFG qualification, since there is no consensus as to the letter base to be used as a reference for comparisons, thereby generating small comparable samples.

TI  - Green Affordable Housing: Cost-Benefit Analysis for Zoning Incentives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In the year 2017, about 89% of the total energy consumed in the US was produced using non-renewable energy sources, and about 43% of tenant households were cost burdened. Local governments are in a unique position to facilitate green affordable housing, that could reduce cost burdens, environmental degradation, and environmental injustice. Nonetheless, limited studies have made progress on the costs and benefits of green affordable housing, to guide decision-making, particularly in small communities. This study investigates density bonus options for green affordable housing by analyzing construction costs, transaction prices, and spillover effects of green certifications and affordable housing units. The authors employ pooled cross-sectional construction cost and price data from 422 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) projects and 11,016 Multiple Listing Service (MLS) transactions in Virginia. Using hedonic regression analyses controlling for mediating factors, the study finds that the new construction of market-rate green certified houses is associated with small upfront costs, but large and statistically significant price premiums. In addition, the construction of market-rate green certified houses has large and statistically significant spillover effects on existing non-certified houses. Existing non-certified affordable housing units show small and often insignificant negative price impacts on the transaction prices of surrounding properties. The study concludes that the magnitude of social benefits associated with green building justifies the local provision of voluntary programs for green affordable housing, where housing is expensive relative to its basic cost of production.

TI  - Energy Performance Certificates and Its Capitalization in Housing Values in Sweden
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The impact on energy performance certificates on housing prices has been investigated extensively in recent years. However, the results of these investigations are mixed. We add to the literature by more specifically controlling for potential biases, by employing a combination of alternative approaches to estimate the causal relationship between house prices and energy performance certificates. We use a traditional hedonic modeling approach, but we additionally employ propensity score methods to be able to compare treated houses with a control group. We also investigate the impact of the outliers, spatial dependency, and parameter heterogeneity of our estimates. Moreover, we use the quantile regression technique to test the hypothesis that the capitalization effect varies across the price distribution. Our results, analyzing more than 100,000 observations, indicate there is an upward bias if one is not controlling for outlier and selection bias. Regardless of the propensity score method approach, the results are lower than a model (around 3 percent capitalization, compared to 6 percent). However, our results do not support that the impact of energy performance certificates varies in the price distribution. Consequently, the certificates are not differently capitalized in the high-end housing price segment. Finally, our results support the hypothesis that the energy performance certificate should be more capitalized into house prices in the northern and colder parts of Sweden than in the southern regions.

TI  - Green building, split-incentives and affordable rental housing policy
T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - We investigate the notion of capitalizing on investments in energy, water and gas efficiency within the context of affordable rental housing subsidy schemes; how associated utility savings offer a means to deliver policy designed to mitigate for issues of split-incentives. An Australian case study representing a typical affordable housing development is analyzed for two scenarios - a 'Business as usual' and 'Green-certified' case. Over a 10-year rental tenancy, operational utility efficiencies, achieved through green building principles are modelled to reduce total housing costs by 1.7-3.8% (AUD $5-18 per week), for one- and four-person households, respectively. Over the building lifecycle, the net present value of improvements are forecasted to be positive, signalling favourable support for policy interventions. The findings provide evidence to support a broader notion of 'housing assistance' to one that includes improved standards on residential utility efficiency. We present three policy options on how to deliver these benefits to stakeholders.

TI  - Lease structures and occupancy costs in eco-labeled buildings
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether energy-efficient green buildings tend to provide net lease structures over gross lease ones. It then considers whether owners benefit by trading away operational savings in a net lease structure. Design/methodology/approach Empirical models of office leasing transactions in Sydney, Australia, with wider transferability supported by analysis of office rent data in the USA. Findings Labeled green buildings are approximately four to five times more likely than non-labeled buildings to use a net lease structure. However, despite receiving operational savings, tenants in net leases pay higher total occupancy costs (TOC), benefiting owners. On average, the increase in TOC paid by tenants in a net lease is equal to or greater than savings attributed to an eco-labeled building. Originality/value The principal-agent market inefficiency, or "split incentive," is a widely cited barrier to private investment in energy-efficient building technology. Here, a uniquely broad look at rental cash flows suggests its role as a barrier is exaggerated.

TI  - EPC Green Premium in Two Different European Climate Zones: A Comparative Study between Barcelona and Turin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Energy performance certificates (EPCs) are important tools aimed at improving buildings' energy performance. They play a central role in the context of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) which asks member states (MS) to take the necessary measures to establish a complete certification system. In this study, an application of the hedonic price method (HPM) assessing the effect of energy labels derived from the EPC on real estate market value is presented. The estimation methodology was applied to two European cities characterized by different climate conditions. The analysis was based on two datasets of listing prices referring to multi-family residential markets in Turin (Italy) and Barcelona (Spain). Four models for each dataset were applied to capture the marginal price of green attributes, but also to control for the spatial autocorrelation among values. The findings showed how the EPC has been applied in the two countries and how it has influenced the real estate market. Turin's buyers pay more attention to the EPC label, while in Barcelona, they value much more single characteristics, such as air conditioning and a swimming pool, considered popular attributes among contemporary buildings in this climate zone. From the results, it is possible to deduce that the implementation of the EPC schemes is still irregular in EU countries and must be strengthened through a standardized rating model.

TI  - Energy Performance Certificates and investments in building energy efficiency: A theoretical analysis
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
CP  - 8th Atlantic Workshop on Energy and Environmental Economics (AWEEE)
AB  - In the European Union, Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) provide potential buyers or tenants with information on a property's energy performance. By mitigating informational asymmetries on real estate markets, the conventional wisdom is that they will reduce energy use, increase energy-efficiency investments, and improve social welfare. We develop a model that partly contradicts these predictions. Although EPCs always improve social welfare in the absence of market failures other than asymmetric information, their impact on energy use and investments is ambiguous and depends both on the time horizon considered and the distribution of energy needs in the population. This implies that, in a second-best world where energy externalities are under-priced, EPCs can damage social welfare. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - High Involvement and Ethical Consumption: A Study of the Environmentally Certified Home Purchase Decision
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Sustainable and energy efficient (SEE) attributes in the housing market have become a focus in Canada. Similarly, understanding the consumer's decision-making process of this high-involvement ethical product has become a burgeoning area for researchers. This study describes the development of the subject, highlighting the nature of the ethical decision-making process and how it relates to this known intention-behaviour gap. An observation, followed by two studies consisting of in-depth interviews with real estate agents and sales representatives (n = 15) and home purchasers/consumers (n = 15), were conducted. Transcriptions were analysed qualitatively with NVivo Pro 12 software (NVivo Pro 12, QSR International Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia). Inductive thematic analysis revealed two main driving themes: information and trust in seller/realtor. Attribute investment return uncertainty was identified as a theme that affects the strength of the relationship between purchase intention and behaviour, whereas the trust in seller/realtor speaks to how and why this effect occurs. The findings present relationships among the driving factors that were identified by realtors and consumers in the SEE housing market, as well as barriers (investment return uncertainty) that prevent consumers from purchasing high-involvement ethical products.

TI  - Energy Factors, Leasing Structure and the Market Price of Office Buildings in the US
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relation between energy factor markets, leasing structures, and the transaction prices of office buildings in the U.S. We employ a large sample of 15,133 office building transactions between 2001 and 2010. In addition to building characteristics, we also include information on the operating expenses, net operating income, and market capitalization rates at sale to estimate an asset-pricing model for commercial office real estate assets. A further set of important controls in our analysis is the forward/futures contract prices for electricity and natural gas. We also include weather metrics for each building's location and sale date. Our final set of controls includes information on the dominant contractual leasing structure of the buildings. Our empirical results suggest that Energy Star labels do not explain additional variance in property prices once the key asset-pricing factors of expenses, income and market capitalization rates are included. By contrast, energy-factor market prices, the shape of the energy forward price curves, and weather metrics are consistently significant determinants of office building transaction prices, suggesting that commercial office building prices are exposed to shocks in these markets.

TI  - Enabling access to household refrigeration services through cost reductions from energy efficiency improvements
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - Refrigerators are widely used by consumers with access to the electricity grid but rarely used in off-grid settings where households rely on a limited supply of electricity such as that by a stand-alone solar home system, because refrigerators' power consumption requires a solar system size that is unaffordable for most consumers. Reducing the power consumption of refrigerators by improving their efficiency is one solution to this issue. In this paper, we assess the technical potential and costs of using commercially available technology to reduce the energy consumption of small (50- and 100-L) refrigerators. Our analysis shows that refrigerator electricity consumption can be reduced by about 50% and 70% using commercially available energy-efficient components at an incremental cost of about $45-$60 and $100-$120 per unit, respectively. Further, we find that highly efficient small refrigerators can be potentially available less than $300 if they sold at scale unlike much higher prices seen in the market today. We also find that the total annualized cost of an off-grid solar home system (including the cost of the refrigerator) can be decreased by about 50% if the most efficient refrigerator we analyzed is used, compared with the same energy system with a standard refrigerator because the additional cost of the efficient refrigerator is significantly lower than the cost savings due to smaller capacity requirements for panels and batteries. We recommend that policies such as awards, procurement, and standards be considered to facilitate the adoption of energy-efficient refrigerators in off-grid and microgrid settings.

TI  - Energy Cost Burdens for Low-Income and Minority Households Evidence From Energy Benchmarking and Audit Data in Five US Cities
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
AB  - Problem, research strategy, and findings: Of the three primary components of housing affordability measures-rent, transportation, and utilities-utility costs are the least understood yet are the one area where the cost burden can be reduced without household relocation. Existing data sources to estimate energy costs are limited to surveys with small samples and low spatial and temporal resolution, such as the American Housing Survey and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey. In this study, we present a new method for small-area estimates of household energy cost burdens (ECBs) that leverages actual building energy use data for approximately 13,000 multifamily properties across five U.S. cities and links energy costs to savings opportunities by analyzing 3,000 energy audit reports. We examine differentials in cost burdens across household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and analyze spatial, regional, and building-level variations in energy use and expenditures. Our results show the average low-income household has an ECB of 7%, whereas higher income households have an average burden of 2%. Notably, even within defined income bands, minority households experience higher ECBs than non-Hispanic White households. For lower income households, low-cost energy improvements could reduce energy costs by as much as $1,500 per year. Takeaway for practice: In this study we attempt to shift the focus of energy efficiency investments to their impact on household cost burdens and overall housing affordability. Our analysis explores new and unique data generated from measurement-driven urban energy policies and shows low-income households disproportionately bear the burden of poor-quality and energy-inefficient housing. Cities can use these new data resources and methods to develop equity-based energy policies that treat energy efficiency and climate mitigation as issues of environmental justice and that apply data-driven, targeted policies to improve quality of life for the most vulnerable urban residents.

TI  - EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CLIMATES ON A SHIPPING CONTAINER PASSIVE HOUSE IN CANADA
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Passive House buildings with an annual energy demand of less than 15 kWh/m(2)a (i.e. kWh/m(2) per annum) can help Canada and other countries achieve thermal comfort with minimum energy use and carbon footprint through meticulous design and selection of highly efficient building envelope elements and appliances. Shipping container based passive houses can reduce the cost of passive house construction and also promote recycling. In this paper, a passive house built using shipping containers, originally designed for Victoria, BC, Canada, is analyzed using Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) software in different climactic zones of Canada. The locations under consideration are: Halifax (Cool-Temperate), Toronto (Cold-Temperate), Edmonton (Cold), and Yellowknife (Arctic-Climate). This paper critically examines the energy demand changes in various climate zones and make necessary modifications to the design to achieve passive house energy performance requirements in selected climates. Results show that with modified designs shipping container passive houses can meet passive house requirements, except in the Arctic-Climate of Yellowknife.

TI  - Smart and Green Buildings Features in the Decision-Making Hierarchy of Office Space Tenants: An Analytic Hierarchy Process Study
T2  - ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - In the paper, we investigate the role of smart building or green building innovations on the Polish real estate market using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method on the group of experts (consultants, managers, brokers) that are active on the office market in Krakow (study area). The findings point towards the highest relevance of the localisation factor, but also at the relatively low importance of the features of a sustainable building: building automation and information technology systems, as well as energy efficiency or certification. The findings suggest that despite the growing interest in sustainability and technological advancement amongst office market participants in Krakow, the relative importance of smart and green building features in their decision-making processes is relatively low. The study has some interesting practical implications. The knowledge regarding the relative importance of decision criteria can be valuable for developers and investors because the anticipation of tenants' expectations is directly linked with return on investment and innovation premiums.

TI  - The impact of Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards: Some evidence from the London office market
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper provides a preliminary evaluation of staged introduction of the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards in England and Wales in the period after announcement but before policy implementation. A process evaluation of the specific policy design focussing on potential sources of policy failure is provided. Drawing upon a database of all EPCs registered for offices in London, preliminary empirical evidence is presented on policy outcomes post-announcement and pre-implementation period. The extent to which EPC G and F rated office buildings in London have improved their EPC rating in anticipation of the introduction of the policy between 2011 until 2017 is analysed. It is found that a maximum of 0.65% of the properties affected by the introduction of minimum standards had modifications that could have been triggered by the policy intervention in the period prior to policy implementation.

TI  - Energy Performance Certificates-The Role of the Energy Price
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Energy performance certificates (EPCs) were introduced to give property buyers better information about the energy efficiency of dwellings and provide incentives to make energy-efficient investments. Previous studies on the effect of EPCs on property value have yielded divergent results, with some studies finding that energy labels affect property values, but others finding that energy labels have little or no effect. The present paper takes the analysis one step further. Using data on energy prices in combination with transaction data from Oslo, we conclude that not only the energy label, but also the energy performance of dwellings in general, has little to no effect on transaction prices. This result is in line with the inferences of several survey studies, which indicate that when people buy a dwelling, they pay considerably less attention to its energy performance compared with other factors, such as the location, neighborhood, size, garden, and the number of bedrooms.

TI  - Providing reliable and financially sustainable electricity access in India using super-efficient appliances
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - In India, 46 million, mostly rural, households lack access to electricity - over 50% of those are in the states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. While India has set an aggressive goal of extending the grid to all households by 2019, grid extension does not necessarily imply reliable electricity access. Indian utilities face a financial disincentive to supplying reliable electricity in rural areas because of subsidized tariffs and low consumer willingness-to-pay. Tariff subsidies for full household electrification in these states would be about Rs 15,000 Cr per year, which is two-times the existing subsidies and equivalent to 20-30% of their annual utility revenues. We find that superefficient lamps, TVs, and fans can reduce the energy consumption of a rural household by over 70% cost-effectively, resulting in a net reduction in the total subsidy burden. Reduced consumption offers an opportunity to raise consumer tariffs while ensuring consumers' monthly electricity bills reduced. We also argue that superefficient appliances make consumer-side storage cost-effective, leading to greater consumer willingness-to-pay. We recommend adoption of super-efficient appliances as part of the electricity access initiative in India, and electricity service based tariff setting as the next policy steps towards providing a reliable and sustainable electricity access.

TI  - Optimization of modular district heating solution based on CHP and RES - Demonstration case of the Municipality of Visoko
T2  - ENERGY
CP  - 13th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES)
AB  - This paper elaborates the concept of the renewable district heating system (DHS) in Municipality of Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of the CoolHeating project funded by the EU's Horizon 2020 programme, which is going to be integrated into the planned DHS supplied by a combined heat and power facility (CHP).
   Forecast of the demand, type and capacities of the production units, as well as optimization of the production plan, was performed by the software EnergyPRO. Calculations are based on inputs such as climate conditions, connection rate for housing facilities, prices of all energy sources, energy efficiency performance of the facilities, temperature level of DHS, heat losses, investment costs, operating costs such as maintenance costs, fuel and electricity prices, taxes, subsidies and finally operating time, while the period for the optimization was calculated per hour throughout the year.
   The overall approach leads to a flexible modular DHS solution based on RES and CHP. Much better economic and environmental sustainability indicators, demonstrated on real inputs of the Visoko project, have been noticed as opposed to the existing heating solution. Similar concepts can be developed for other communities to ensure replication and thus multiply the effects and contribution to sustainable development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A study of citywide urban residential energy information system for the building energy efficiency management: a cluster model of seven typical cities in China
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - The lack of empirical data demonstrating the relationship between influencing factors and building energy performance is one of the primary barriers in energy efficiency management. A citywide residential energy information database and the data-based analytical methodology help increase the knowledge about the local real estate situation, explore energy efficiency opportunities and measures, financial investment, and market trend in the local building stocks, and make the reasonable policies as well. Few databases were established in USA and Europe only covering the building information and energy use, while there are lack of an indices system and database of building energy efficiency information in China. Therefore, in this study, a definition of urban residential energy information system is suggested, covering the parameters of building characteristics, household characteristics, possession and operation of domestic appliances, indoor thermal environment, climate condition, energy market, economic level, municipal infrastructure, and energy use consequence. Consequently, a database is developed to collect the raw data in seven typical cities in China. A classification model is established by Quantitative Theory III to classify and characterize the urban residential energy use systems into three different city groups, and suggestions are made to guide the energy efficiency work for different city groups. The case study is a good example to demonstrate the methodology and the analysis provided a helpful reference for the citywide building energy efficiency management.

AB  - The aim of this article is to introduce for the first time the topic of 'stranded assets' into research involving the built environment. It focuses on the idea that climate change policy could induce the stranding of some conventional property assets in the global real estate market. Principally, the empirical focus for study is the UK interaction with energy performance certificates and minimum energy performance standards. However, comparisons are made internationally, and key distinctions are made between developed and less developed countries. The article observes that stranded assets are not new in real estate; the changing consumer demand of occupiers has regularly rendered property assets redundant or obsolete. However, what is new is the influence of climate change and associated environmental policy on some property assets. The article deliberately combines conceptual agendas often studied in isolation. Theories of path dependence and lock-in are used to understand the problematic traction of climate change legislation within traditional real estate institutions. The implications of this situation, the potentially hidden systemic socio-economic reach of stranded assets, is then considered through the lens of contemporary debates of financialisation. Socio-technical system theory, as it relates to contemporary energy policy regimes, is then examined to connect persistent lock-in with financialised global investment markets. The article then posits how associated legislation could be used to capture a global picture of stranded assets in real estate. Revealing the stranded asset exposure should be a concern to real estate investors and those charged with managing such assets. However, more optimistically this potential risk may provide the catalyst for energy efficient transition in the built environment. The article concludes by outlining an interdisciplinary research agenda for stranded assets in global real estate.

TI  - Calculation and comparative analysis of thermal transmittance (U-value) of Scottish houses from recent centuries
T2  - INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Research was conducted on the steady-state heat loss of dwellings, as quantified by U-value assessment, to provide an appraisal with a range of factors that may impact energy performance and environmental behaviour. The study consisted of 50 houses built between 1915 and 2015 and 50 from pre-1915 identified as traditional construction. All were Scottish homes, and some were in poor condition. This paper finds that there is a close correlation between U-values of components and the age of a property and its energy efficiency. It also finds that the U-values of elements of houses built after 1985 increased more rapidly. It is considered that for older homes, there was less improvement/change on U-values. It is concluded that using renewable energy systems and sustainable technologies are necessary for old houses to meet Level 6 of the code for sustainable homes in the UK. A trend of U-value reduction with wall thickness was observed, but no simple correlation could be determined and each circumstance identified which materials could be applied to best effect.

TI  - Characterisation of Australian apartment electricity demand and its implications for low-carbon cities
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - Understanding of residential electricity demand has application in efficient building design, network planning and broader policy and regulation, as well as in planning the deployment of energy efficiency technologies and distributed energy resources with potential emissions reduction benefits and societal and household cost savings. Very few studies have explored the specific demand characteristics of apartments, which house a growing proportion of the global urban population.
   We present a study of apartment electricity loads, using a dataset containing a year of half-hourly electricity data for 6,000 Australian households, to examine the relationship between dwelling type, demographic characteristics and load profile. The focus on apartments, combined with the size of the data set, and the representative seasonal load profiles obtained through clustering full annual profiles, is unique in the literature. We find that median per-occupant household electricity use is 21% lower for apartments than for houses and that, on average, apartments have lower load factor and higher daily load variability, and show greater diversity in their daily peak times, resulting in a lower coincidence factor for aggregations of apartment loads. Using cluster analysis and classification, we also show the impact of dwelling type on the shape of household electricity load profiles. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of Building Thermal Performance using Simple Sensors and Air Conditioners
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Energy and environmental problems have attracted attention worldwide. Energy consumption in residential sectors accounts for a large percentage of total consumption. Several retrofit schemes, which insulate building envelopes to increase energy efficiency, have been adapted to address residential energy problems. However, these schemes often fail to balance the installment cost with savings from the retrofits. To maximize the benefit, selecting houses with low thermal performance by a cost-effective method is inevitable. Therefore, an accurate, low-cost, and undemanding housing assessment method is required. This paper proposes a thermal performance assessment method for residential housing. The proposed method enables assessments under the existing conditions of residential housings and only requires a simple and affordable monitoring system of power meters for an air conditioner (AC), simple sensors (three thermometers at most), a BLE beacon, and smartphone application. The proposed method is evaluated thoroughly by using both simulation and experimental data. Analysis of estimation errors is also conducted. Our method shows that the accuracy achieved with the proposed three-room model is 9.8% (relative error) for the simulation data. Assessments on the experimental data also show that our proposed method achieved Ua value estimations using a low-cost system, satisfying the requirements of housing assessments for retrofits.

TI  - Dry laying of masonry to build demountable, highly energy-efficient prototype houses First findings from a currently running research project
T2  - MAUERWERK
AB  - In recent decades, energy efficiency has been the priority for masonry buildings in order to keep up with ever more stringent requirements. For the evaluation of the sustainability of building solutions, however, the embodied energy to produce a building and finally to dispose of it at the end of its lifecycle are also important. The energy used for the disposal of a building and the processing of the residues are also important for the overall energy balance since the handling of natural resources is increasingly the centre point of thought and action. A research team at the Chair of Structural Design of TU Dresden has thus been working since 2012 on demountable solutions in masonry, which can be dismantled at the end of a building lifetime and sorted for recycling, which fully complies with the requirement for the reduction of rubbish and waste products. The high precision of block production today permits us to omit the levelling effect of mortar and to build dry buildings in the future, i.e. to do without the bonding principle. The associated strength reductions can be suffered without problems. The appropriate basics of such a dry building method have been researched in a collaboration between the ILEK in Stuttgart and the Xella Technologie- und Forschungsgesellschaft mbH in Emstal. In this research project with the abbreviation "REMOMAB", the basics of an energy-efficient dry building method suitable for recycling were collected and made available for practical application. In a follow-up project, these basics are being implemented and tested on an experimental building. Cost aspects are also to be taken into account and if possible, construction solutions available on the market will be used - modified if necessary. Another aim is for the first time to dismantle such a building and to rebuild it at another location. This is intended to demonstrate that a reuse is possible after dismantling and such a building method can react to changing demands in the housing market.

TI  - Simulation and Testing of the Calorific Value and Cost Analysis of Biomass Pyrolysis for Heating, Cooling, and Power Production
T2  - BIORESOURCES
AB  - Ni-based catalysts supported on olivine were synthesized for cracking the biomass and producing the syngas. Syngas is used directly as fuel source for the cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system, which can be produced through biomass pyrolysis process. Integrating combined CCHP systems with biomass pyrolysis results in a sustainable distributed energy system that effectively utilizes biomass resources and improves energy efficiency. To achieve a higher energy efficiency and more cost-effective operation, a simplified cost analysis method based on the Advanced System for Process Engineering (Aspen Plus) was applied to the CCHP system based on biomass pyrolysis. First, syngas was used as a fuel source for the CCHP system, which can be produced through a biomass pyrolysis experiment. In the experiment, the yields of the gas before and after the addition of a catalyst were compared. Second, syngas was passed to the reactor in Aspen Plus, which simulated the calorific values of the syngas produced by biomass pyrolysis under different conditions. Moreover, the simulated syngas heat values were applied to a TFRJ3K straw gas engine. Finally, the cost of the syngas for power generation, cooling, and heating was calculated. The power generation cost was 1.2 RMB/kW, the air conditioning refrigeration cost was 22.752 RMB/d, and the household heating cost was 20 RMB/d.

TI  - Do energy efficiency standards hurt consumers? Evidence from household appliance sales
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - We build novel welfare-based price indices for major household appliances that leverage changes in same-model prices and how consumers substitute between exiting, continuing and new models. We then evaluate how minimum energy efficiency requirements and changing criteria for Energy Star (TM) labels affected these indices in the U.S. between 2001 and 2011, a period of time when some appliances experienced standard changes while others did not. We find that prices declined while quality and consumer welfare increased, especially when standards become more stringent. We also find that much of the price index decline can be attributed to standards-induced innovation, or cannibalism, not to inter-manufacturer competition. Our results also add to a growing body of evidence that the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation due to inadequate account of quality and substitution to new goods. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Energy-Efficient Real Estate or How It Is Perceived by Potential Homebuyers in Four Latin American Countries
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This article analyses how energy efficiency regulatory frameworks have been developed in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Chile, within a context of developing countries, and it discusses if this context has been able to influence a culture of buildings' energy efficiency in consumers. An online survey was applied to consumers who wanted to buy a house, aiming to understand their position regarding sustainability, and the role of the state versus the individual role, among other issues. The aim of the study is to identify consumer's perception of energy efficiency and sustainability to promote a future research agenda in the Latin American context. In general, consumers value sustainability, except when they are presented in opposition to economic growth and social protection. However, it is possible to identify differences between Chile, with an established neoliberal economy, and countries that have economies in transition. Indeed, Argentina and Brazil show differences in terms of the role of the State, or the thermal comfort, which is considered a matter of habits rather than a mere technological problem. For driving more sustainable behaviours, consumers should be engaged in the implementation of these standards, creating a twofold process including homebuyers on one hand and mandatory requirements on the other.

TI  - Decision-support method for profitable residential energy retrofitting based on energy-related occupant behaviour
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Low-carbon energy retrofitting in buildings plays an important role because 75% of European buildings are considered inefficient and more than 40% are currently over 50 years old. The economic reinvestment of energy retrofit actions through reduced energy bills, as energy directives promote, greatly depends upon the energy consumption patterns. In support of the decision-making process towards a low-carbon energy transition in multi-family buildings, this paper introduces a novel assessment method that evaluates the profitability of energy efficiency measures, according to standard operating conditions derived from energy performance certificate procedures and real occupant energy consumption scenarios, through a parametric analysis. The aim is to assess the real energy and economic savings of retrofitting actions, depending on different energy-related occupant scenarios, and to enable comparisons with other buildings, providing a valuable model to identify the most feasible and low-carbon energy strategies in residential energy retrofitting. A Spanish multi-family building from 1942 is taken as the reference case study. The results show that energy savings for dwellings vary up to 80%, and the net present value per dwelling differs by up to 20,000 between different energy consumption patterns. The most appropriate energy efficiency measures according to low, medium or high consumption scenarios are highlighted. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable affordable housing
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Interventions for sustainability attainment in affordable housing have received increasing attention from policy makers globally. However, policy-makers' interventions for sustainable affordable housing markets can be inefficient and even counterproductive. As such, among the diverse interventions available, a vital question is what are the potential efficient interventions? To address this question, the views of affordable housing experts (also knowledgeable in sustainable housing) around the world were solicited via a questionnaire survey to identify critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable affordable housing. Relative significance analysis of the data led to the identification of 13 CSFs. Furthermore, agreement analysis revealed that there is no good agreement between respondents from the academic sector and those from the industrial sector on the ranking of the 13 CSFs. Moreover, through factor analysis, the CSFs were grouped into four underlying components: developer's enabling CSFs; household-demand enabling CSFs; mixed land use CSFs; land use planning CSFs. The research findings seek to inform policy-makers on the CSFs for efficient resource utilization for sustainable affordable housing market. Future study would establish a relationship between the CSFs and success criteria for sustainable affordable housing.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of the Real Estate Market in a Social Perspective: Results from the Turin's (Italy) Experience
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In Italy, it has always been difficult to collect reliable data on real estate given the opacity of the information available. Keeping into consideration the actual availability of data and information, the possibility to have a structure for permanently monitoring and analysing the real estate market is fundamental. Focusing on developing and disseminating knowledge related to practices in this context, in this paper the Turin's (Northern Italy) experience is presented, through the Real Estate Market Observatory (TREMO): This structure is based on a data-warehouse, implemented over time, with databases that lead to historic price observations of the residential market. The data warehouse is the basis for investigating methodologies and analyses, assuming the spatial requisites of the data and its georeferencing as the main discriminant in choosing among descriptive statistics, multi-varied or spatial analysis methods. In twenty years, several studies have been developed, allowing us not only to explore the applicability of models and operative modalities, but also to obtain results with a high potential impact under a social viewpoint. In this paper, the methodologies developed for implementing the monitoring structure are presented, specifically the quality process and computerized analysis procedures, followed by some representative research experiences with reference to aims, models and results.

TI  - Macroeconomic impact of the German energy transition and its distribution by sectors and regions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Macroeconomic impacts such as changes in economic structures and employment are very important when evaluating the energy transition in societal terms. We employ a macroeconomic model that accounts for regional, economic and sectoral features. The model results show how the overall positive net impacts of the energy transition in Germany energy efficiency and renewable energies - on economic growth and employment up to 2030 are distributed across sectors and regions. The biggest relative increases in value added occur in construction, real estate and electricity generation; the biggest decrease is in mining of lignite. Significant effects mainly result from changes in the heat and transport sectors, while the transition in the electricity sector entails smaller impacts. The latter are, however, relevant to the regional distribution: The model results suggest that especially northern and eastern German federal states will benefit economically from the energy transition because they offer attractive locations for investments. At the same time, these states are less affected by decreasing conventional energy generation. Moreover, the impact of rising electricity prices is less negative here than in the other federal states because of their lower electricity intensity in production. In summary, the energy transition represents an opportunity for these regions to strengthen their economies.

TI  - AN INTEGRATED DESIGN PROCESS OF LOW-COST HOUSING IN CHILE
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - This paper discusses the application of Integrated Design Process for the design of low-cost housing in Chile. It aims to question common practice for the development of housing based on prescriptive regulations and non-interdisciplinary work, which has resulted in poor quality building requirements. The first stage consisted in defining performance requirements for aspects such as energy demand, U value, air tightness and indoor air quality for a specific case of low-cost houses located in the city of Temuco. An integrated design process was carried out by an interdisciplinary team of professionals specialized in each of the performance aspects that were taken into account. The construction and post-occupancy stages were characterized by verifying the performance requirements, which resulted in a low-cost house prototype that included strategies for energy efficiency and a healthy indoor environment.

TI  - CO2 emission linkage analysis in global construction sectors: Alarming trends from 1995 to 2009 and possible repercussions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - As significant contributors to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the international construction sector is under great pressure to mitigate CO2 emissions and slow global warming more aggressively. The aim of this study is to measure and compare the sectoral CO2 emission linkages and their structures in the construction sectors of 41 countries over 1995-2009 by combing a hybrid multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model and the hypothesis extraction method. The backward and forward CO2 emission linkages indicate that the international construction sector plays a significant role in importing CO2 emissions from upstream industries, while the export of CO2 emissions to downstream industries is relatively minimal. Four fundamental linkage elements show that the net backward CO2 emission linkages account for the largest proportion, followed by the mixed and net forward CO2 emission linkages, while the mixed backward CO2 emission linkages are relatively small. The leading CO2 emission inflows are from the energy, resource and raw-material sectors. The outflows from the construction sector are mainly to the real estate and public utilities sectors. Based on these findings, the paper puts forward countermeasures for the global construction sector to improve energy efficiency, promote industrial structure upgrading and improve the policy system for greenhouse gas emission reduction.

TI  - Analysis of the pattern of energy consumptions and its impact on urban environmental sustainability in Jordan: Amman City as a case study
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Background: The energy sector plays an important role in the economic growth in Jordan due to the fact that Jordan imports around 97% of its needs from primary energy. The purpose of this study is to explore the pattern of electricity consumption and energy loss to highlight the strengths and weakness of energy efficiency in the context of the urban sustainability of Amman City in Jordan.
   Methods: The design of sustainable urban development is based on the urban interdependencies approach, which incorporates the stakeholders to identify and pursue synergies between multiple sectors. This approach includes the identification of the functional sectors, which are related to institutional and behavioral levels in the society, raising the level of institutional performance and improving the quality of urban services. The spatial statistical analysis approach and GIS applied to analyze the consumption pattern of electrical power in the study area.
   Results and conclusion: There was a considerable increase in the peak domestic consumption, as the peak load reached 3320 MW in 2017 with an annual increment rate of 4.9%. Regarding energy efficiency, the value of total electrical energy losses reached 13% in 2017; around 90% of this loss occurred in the electrical distribution stage. Geographical distribution of the household electrical power shows that the east and middle parts of Amman have low consumption levels compared to the west residential parts. The energy consumption pattern has an inverse relation with the population distribution, family size, and building characteristics in the city. This is clearly identified by addressing the downtown region that has the lowest energy consumption and the highest-density population, while the western part has the highest energy consumption and low-population density. These variations can be referred to as differences in social and economic behaviors of inhabitants in both high-density and low-density population areas.
   This analysis reflects the influence of several factors that should be taken into account in energy sustainability strategies. Energy consumption is influenced by the characteristics of households which include building size, household income, total energy cost, and building characteristics (e.g., building design, age, location, and using thermal insulation system for buildings).

TI  - On the relationship between building energy efficiency, aesthetic features and marketability: Toward a novel policy for energy demand reduction
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Despite significant progresses in development of energy-efficient buildings (EEBs), energy demand in building sector is still drastically increasing. This paradox is conceptualized in this study as Inefficiency of Increased Building Energy Efficiency. Marketability failure of EEBs and inefficiency in integrated design approach are the main causes of this paradox. Compared to merely focusing on the energy-efficiency enhancement, increasing the number of EEBs with a better marketability via enhancement of their aesthetic features is proposed as a novel approach for energy demand reduction in the building sector. This article aims to first investigate the current stage of EEBs' adoption and the associated market barriers, and then to propose a multidisciplinary design approach to scrutinize the role of aesthetic features on buildings' marketability for development of effective policies. Conducted comprehensive survey among real-estate agencies across 26 UK cities reveals a negative correlation between the energy-efficiency and housing marketability. Moreover, house price and aesthetic features are understood as the most dominant parameters that impact individuals' buying decision. Any extra initial cost of EEBs over 3% is likely to face market resistance. Furthermore, strong empirical evidences have been found to confirm that the proposed approach has a substantial potential to increase the EEBs' number.

TI  - The effect of house energy efficiency programs on the extensive and intensive margin of lower-income households' investment behavior
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper examines the biggest house energy efficiency retrofit support program in Greece which ran during 2011-2015 and approximately fifty thousand households participated. We take advantage of an exogenous policy change resulting in cost reduction for households that occurred while the program was running. This change substantially increased the subsidy rate for lower-income households. We find that this effective cost reduction increased the participation rate (extensive margin). We add to the literature on retrofits by further showing that this change increased substantially the investment amount (intensive margin) of these lower-income households. Detailed data on a sub-sample of households reveal that this increase was driven primarily by window replacement and thermal insulation investments.

TI  - Energy efficiency in the German residential housing market: Its influence on tenants and owners
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) were introduced by the European Union as a transparency tool in order to meet the targets of reducing the energy consumption of buildings. However, several inefficiencies hindered their implementation, resulting in a recast of the corresponding Directive coming into force in Germany in 2014. In 2012, Amecke (2012) was predicting that a "fundamental change" would occur due to the upcoming improvement of EPCs' legal status. This follow-up investigation proves Amecke's assumption and expands the examination by comparing different target groups (tenants vs. owners) and elicitation methods (indirect approach via choice-based conjoint analysis vs. direct approach via self-explicated method). We analyzed the survey responses of 206 participants (108 tenants, 98 owners), which had been collected between May and July 2017. The results of the indirect approach suggest an ongoing change in the housing market, as energy efficiency achieves a high importance score similar to that of rent resp. price and of location. Owners are significantly more familiar with the EPC tool, giving it stronger consideration than tenants do. The results indicate three main policy implications concerning enhanced (i) transparency regulation and its compliance, (ii) environmental awareness, and (iii) communication of economic incentives.

TI  - Alleviating energy poverty experienced by students living in private rented accommodation: The role of the housing provider
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BUSINESS EXCELLENCE
CP  - 13th International Conference on Business Excellence (ICBE) - Sustainable Business Models and Innovation in the Knowledge Economy
AB  - Students are often described as an under-reported and under-supported group of the population falling into energy poverty. Although the main drivers of energy poverty are well documented, up to this date little attention is given to housing tenure as a cause of energy poverty. This study aims to support the understanding of the motivations and barriers faced by property owners that rent accommodation to students for making energy efficiency improvements to their rented properties. With this understanding recommendations for alleviating energy poverty experienced by students living in the private rented sector can be formulated. The research conducted is based on qualitative methods; focus group discussions and interviews. Data were collected from almost 30 student landlords in seven EU countries between October 2017 and January 2018. Findings show that grants and financial incentives are key for the questioned proprietors to move to energy efficiency improvements of their property but bureaucracy burdens are a major barrier for moving forward with them. In addition, the need for stronger information campaigns on energy efficiency issues is revealed. Eventually, a number of financial, consumer protection, energy efficiency and informational measures for alleviating energy poverty experienced by students living in private rented accommodation are proposed.

TI  - Impact of voluntary green certification on building energy performance
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Credible estimates of energy savings from green buildings are critical for policy makers to examine the cost and benefit of various incentives intended to encourage commercial buildings to go green (e.g. expedited construction permits, government grants, and property tax incentives). Yet, data limitations have hindered reliable estimations. Filling this gap, this study uses a large panel dataset on energy consumption for commercial buildings in Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona. By tracking building occupants' monthly energy consumption before and after the building's certification as an Energy Star building, we provide new estimates of the environmental gains from private investment in green real estate. Results show that for occupants that occupy space in a certified building in both the pre-certification and post-certification periods, occupants in Energy Star buildings consume 8% less energy. This empirically robust estimate of potential benefit from green-certification provides a quantifiable benchmark against which green-promoting policies can be measured. We also document evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects. Energy savings differ by the building's initial certification points and the building's baseline energy consumption. These results are useful for policy makers to identify targets for green certification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tax incentives to modernize the energy efficiency of the housing in Spain
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper analyzes the tax incentives and aids adopted in the taxes and environmental policies to improve the energy efficiency of Spanish households. The established environmental policy presents advances although with incipient results, since the energy efficiency of the houses still plays a secondary role. In the area of taxes, no tax incentives have been effective in reducing the investment in improvements in the energy efficiency of homes, especially in those of old construction. Our conclusions indicate the convenience of promoting the energy efficiency of homes through the fiscal route. In this sense, it proposes incorporating an incentive to the Personal Income Tax linked to improved energy rating of housing. Also, it raises the improvements in the current regulations on tax benefits on the Real Estate Tax and on the Tax on Building, Installations and Infrastructural Work. These are two of the main features of this paper.

TI  - Real estate investment and energy efficiency: Evidence from China's policy experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The Chinese government conducted a policy experiment on real estate-led economic growth on such a massive scale, which is unprecedented. This paper empirically analyzes the impact of real estate investment on energy efficiency. Provincial level panel data of China during 2004-2012 was used for the analysis. Two-way Fixed Effect model was applied to test the impact of real estate investment on total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE). The findings in this paper are: a certain degree of the real estate-led model of economic development can improve TFEE of the economy. Developing countries can gain economic development and energy efficiency improvement simultaneously by developing the real estate industry to a certain extent. But the impact of real estate investment on TFEE exhibits a nonlinear characteristic, that is, when the real estate investment proportion exceeds the threshold value, the impact of real estate investment on TFEE will take a reversal; Except Beijing, Shanghai, Hainan and Zhejiang provinces, to some extent, improving real estate investment can be helpful to improve TFEE in most of China's provinces.

TI  - The evolution of energy efficiency impact on housing prices. An analysis for Metropolitan Barcelona
T2  - REVISTA DE LA CONSTRUCCION
AB  - The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive has it made mandatory to include an energy performance certificate (EPC) on real estate advertisements so as to promote efficient properties. Previous research has found a positive correlation between residential prices and EPC's energy ranks; nonetheless, the analysis of the evolution of such impact for the same market is still pending. This paper tries to shed light on this issue by analyzing the evolution of prices of the second largest urban agglomeration in Spain. In doing so, a pooled hedonic model is carried out departing from selling listing prices of apartments and a set of locative control variables. Results suggest that in a short period the energy premium for multifamily houses has positively evolved. As a result, a sharped market differentiation arises between inefficient and energy saving dwellings. Such findings have significant implications for the construction and real estate industry, since higher selling prices may compensate for higher building costs coming from energy efficient technologies.

TI  - Innovative Policies for Energy Efficiency and the Use of Renewables in Households
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Renewable energy sources (RES) are gradually becoming one of the key elements in the process of achieving energy efficiency worldwide. This trend can be observed in many developed Western economiesfor example, in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom. Hence, the role of innovative policies for promoting energy efficiency is becoming crucial in transition to the post-carbon economy. The shift to the carbon-free future make all actors to face forgoing commitments Nevertheless, customers and residential households are the first and the most important players in the pursuit of the energy-efficient future. Without them, carbon-free economy based on RES would never take the shape as envisaged. Our paper focuses on the innovative strategies and policies studying the effect and the scope of RES penetration into the households. We employ and empirical analysis of the effects from using RES in households using an example of the residential households in the northwest region of the United Kingdom (UK) with and without solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and electric vehicles (EV). We analyse the four scenarios that are aimed at analysing the system dynamics and providing differentiation between systems in terms of the varying values of the gross demand, tariffs, metered import, and the total revenue. Our results demonstrate that the solar PV leads to the transfer of costs and wealth regardless of the ownership of PV and EVs. Solar energy generation reduces the share of UK solar PV households per kWh costs of the distribution system which causes the augmenting of the per unit charges as well as to the changes in payments for the electricity that impoverishes less wealthy customer groups. It also becomes clear that with the increase of EV penetration, the existing energy efficiency schemes would have to be revised.

TI  - Valorisation of energy services: essay on the value addition due to renewable energy
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB  - The shift from fossil fuels and traditional renewable energy to costlier modern renewable energy based on geothermal wind and solar resources is explained.Statistical data collected from 14 countries with a population greater than 100 million inhabitants was used, where the EU is considered as a country. The period from 1990 to 2015 is covered, however divided in two parts, 1990-2005 when conditions were not favourable for renewable energy because the price of fossil fuels and policy support for renewable energy were low, and 2005-2015 when these conditions improved.Theoretical analyses show that the high price of fossil fuels, policy support and cost-effective technologies can explain the fast growth of modern renewable energy during 2005-2015; however, they only partially account for its slower growth during 1990-2005. An additional explanation might be that the innovators generate qualities due to renewable energy use, which are expressed on the markets as value addition of energy services. The statistical analysis of energy services during 1990-2005 shows that the European Union (EU) led in renewable energy compared to the United States (US), Japan and other countries, which was driven by the social initiatives that fostered new firms in the electricity and gas business. A statistical analysis of energy services in the US and EU during 2005-2015 reveals that their value added has grown on an annual average of 2.0% and 2.8%, respectively, which denotes an annual increase of 3 billion and 6 billion US dollars in the 2005 value (USD2005). This valorisation of energy services has invoked further innovations in distributed energy systems and energy storage. A further statistical analysis of the 14 largest countries by population confirms a valorisation of energy services due to modern renewable energy where the emission reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a side-effect. Extrapolation of the averagegrowth rates from the period 1990 to 2015 to the period 2015 to 2040, without any change but a substitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy, demonstrates that global income would grow fourfold and energy consumption twofold along with a 100 times larger modern renewable energy and CO2 reduction to 46% of the 2015 level. When those average growth rates of renewable energy decrease linear to 25%in 2040, the global modern renewable energy grows tenfold and CO2 reduces to 82% of the 2015 level.The implication of this statistical study on large countries shows that higher value energy services for households are often based on distributed renewable energy and that such an addition of value generates a CO2 emission reduction as a side effect which can be enhanced by pricing CO2 or obstructed by policy support for the vested interests. This study indicated that the valorisation of energy services will generate a growth of income, energy consumption and renewable energy along with a far-reaching emission reduction of CO2 if policies do foster sustainable innovations.

TI  - The emergence of data centres as an innovative alternative property sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose - As one of the increasingly important alternative property sectors, data centres are a technology-focused property sector that is taking advantage of the growing investment intensity in technology-related infrastructure, against the backdrop of constant innovation and advancement in technology. The purpose of this paper is to assess the preliminary risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification benefits of data centre Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the USA, Australia and Singapore. The strategic implications going forward for data centres as an innovative property sector in the property investment space are also highlighted.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using monthly total returns, the average annual return, annual risk, risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification benefits of data centre REITs in the USA, Australia and Singapore over 2016-2018 are assessed. Optimal asset allocation analysis is performed to investigate the value-added role of data centre REITs in a mixed-asset portfolio.
   Findings - Data centre REITs delivered strong average annual return performance, outperforming the composite REITs in all three markets. This also sees data centre REITs being riskier than the overall REIT sector due to the non-traditional and maturing status of the data centre property sector. On a risk-adjusted basis, competitive performance was recorded for data centre REITs, with data centre REITs in the USA and Singapore outperforming their respective composite REITs. This performance is also delivered with significant portfolio diversification benefits with the stock market, resulting in data centre REITs contributing to the US mixed-asset portfolios across a diverse risk spectrum.
   Practical implications - Institutional investors are now giving increased emphasis to alternative property sectors with better risk-return trade-offs. Improved performance and diversification benefits are achieved by supplementing existing property portfolios with non-traditional property sectors with counter-cyclical risk-return profiles, one of which is the data centre property sector. This sees data centres as an important alternative property sector, having technology-based drivers and being recognised as having a clear path towards institutionalisation with the major investors in the near future.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first published empirical research analysis that specifically assessed the preliminary performance and diversification benefits of data centre REITs in the USA, Australia and Singapore. This research enables empirically validated, more informed and practical property investment decision making by institutional investors regarding the future strategic role of the data centre property sector as an innovative sector in the institutional property investment space.

TI  - From Residential Energy Demand to Fuel Poverty: Income-induced Non-linearities in the Reactions of Households to Energy Price Fluctuations
T2  - ENERGY JOURNAL
AB  - The residential energy demand is growing steadily and the trend is expected to continue in the near future. At the same time, under the impulse of economic crises and environmental and energy policies, many households have experienced reductions in real income and higher energy prices. In the residential sector, the number of fuel-poor households is thus expected to rise. A better understanding of the determinants of residential energy demand, in particular of the role of income and the sensitivity of households to changes in energy prices, is crucial in the context of recurrent debates on energy efficiency and fuel poverty.
   We propose a panel threshold regression (PTR) model to empirically test the sensitivity of French households to energy price fluctuations-as measured by the elasticity of residential heating energy prices-and to analyze the overlap between their income and fuel poverty profiles. The PTR model allows to test for the non-linear effect of income on the reactions of households to fluctuations in energy prices. Thus, it can identify specific regimes differing by their level of estimated price elasticities. Each regime represents an elasticity-homogeneous group of households. The number of these regimes is determined based on an endogenously PTR-fixed income threshold. Thereafter, we analyze the composition of the regimes (i.e. groups) to locate the dominant proportion of fuel-poor households and analyse their monetary poverty characteristics.
   Results show that, depending on the income level, we can identify two groups of households that react differently to residential energy price fluctuations and that fuel-poor households belong mostly to the group of households with the highest elasticity. By extension, results also show that income poverty does not necessarily mean fuel poverty.
   In terms of public policy, we suggest focusing on income heterogeneity by considering different groups of households separately when defining energy efficiency measures. We also suggest paying particular attention to targeting fuel-poor households by examining the overlap between fuel and income poverty.

TI  - A tool for the assessment of energy-efficiency retrofit packages based on simulations, for single-family housing in Concepcion, Chile
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - A variety of retrofit options can be undertaken to reduce the growing energy consumption and ensure indoor comfort levels in housing. These offer specific solutions whose energy performance can be determined using building thermal performance simulations. This article presents a computer tool to help analyse alternatives to improve energy performance for single-family housing in the city of Concepcin, Chile. This software provides a novel procedure to manage thermal simulations, defining retrofit packages based on simulation results and that include price calculations. The software also allows estimates to be made using data from previously studied housing in the region. Background data are presented on the housing type under study as well as the proposed retrofit options and the analysis of some case studies. The software can suggest retrofit packages which provide reductions that range from a quarter to half the total energy demand at a cost of between 5 and 15% of total house value. These results show that the proposed tool works properly and provides good energy-efficiency retrofit recommendations for this type of housing, allowing it to be used as an innovative public dissemination instrument. Furthermore, it can be extended to manage simulations of other dwelling typologies or regions to support professional work.

TI  - Cities and planetary repair: The problem with climate retrofitting
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
AB  - In the 2010s, major US initiatives framed urban retrofitting as a decarbonization solution. These programs address an obtrusive legacy of industrial capitalism: its built environments shed energy and emissions when they fall into disrepair. Political ecology and economy have been slow to engage retrofitting, an absence that is conspicuous as these fields take on planetary repair as a conceptual provocation and turn in mainstream conservation. This paper explores US retrofitting as a distinctive material repair practice, one born as an energy poverty program amid the scarcity fears of the 1970s Energy Crisis but seeing a renaissance today as a program for green capitalist growth. I interrogate two economies of repair now emerging around retrofitting, energy market and cleantech aspirations to make energy efficiency a resource and articulated efforts to sell retrofits as new green value for real estate development and investment. Such urban revaluation efforts join an expanding array of green gentrification schemes today. Paradoxically, even as would-be green entrepreneurs are drawn to these seemingly intangible and "clean" forms of waste and value-in-waiting, retrofitting presents intransigent materialities. Its decarbonization ambitions demand not just profit-generating urban repair today but large-scale urban maintenance into the future. This need confronts longstanding efforts to render US cities and built environments flexible to recurrent creative destruction in service of ongoing economic growth. Such logics of de/revaluation and essential disposability permit concurrent US programs for gentrification and urban abandonment today. However, decarbonization requires a more substantial confrontation with capitalist ruination-as-usual.

TI  - Environmentally-certified space and retail revenues: A study of US bank branches
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Much research exists measuring income and valuation premiums to owners and operators of environmentally-certified real estate, yet little work examines the financial impact to the space users, outside of decreased utility costs. Such implications for space users are of great importance, as tenant businesses may be unwilling or unable to pay a rental rate premium for environmentally-certified space if there is not an associated user benefit. Under a simple yet rigorous fixed effects model with geographic clustering, we study the relationship between environmentally-certified retail space and location specific financial performance. Examining retail bank branches, we find that LEED certified spaces are associated with above average deposit levels, while Energy Star-certified branches offer inconsistent results. These results are tested in an event study which validates the findings, and indicates that the benefits of LEED extend years past initial certification, evidencing lasting income-related benefits. Finally, bank- and branch-specific subsample analyses confirm these results while controlling for idiosyncratic characteristics. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The impact of policy on residential energy consumption
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - Due to the growing concerns about global climate change and energy dependence, many countries have introduced regulations targeting the energy efficiency of the residential sector. However, whether these policies have been effective in reducing the total residential consumption of energy is still unclear. In this paper, we analyze the impact of residential energy efficiency policies on household energy consumption across Europe for the period 1980-2016. We examine the electricity and non-electricity energy consumption separately, as these are generally used for different purposes (appliances and heating) by households and are subject to different energy efficiency policies. We focus on two distinct types of regulations mandatory energy efficiency labels for household appliances and building standards. After controlling for county-specific effects and changes in income, energy prices, demography and climate conditions over our sample period, our results offer compelling evidence that both the energy labeling requirements for appliances and the stricter building codes lead up to lower residential energy consumption. According to our estimation results, we should expect a 0.24% reduction in residential electricity use after governments introduce a mandatory disclosure of energy labels for an appliance group that represent ten percent of households' electricity use. Similarly, given that U-values proxy the thermal quality of the new dwellings, we find that a 0.1 unit decrease in the U-value requirement triggers a lasting 0.28% annual decrease in residential non-electricity energy consumption. These results can help policymakers to shape future regulations targeted on reducing our energy use in the years to come. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Green Premium Evidence from Climatic Areas: A Case in Southern Europe, Alicante (Spain)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The existence of a green premium in house (asking) prices in Alicante province, Spain, are analyzed using circa 9000 property observations. In developing the sample, information from energy efficiency certificates was matched with two other databases. The model tests for green premium by climatic zones using pool Ordinary Least Squares (pool-OLS) and Instrumental Variables (IV) hedonic models, adds new knowledge concerning the existence of green premiums from Southern Europe, explores differences in their estimation by climatic zone, debates the nature of the estimated green parameters, and explains the role of endogeneity in hedonic green premium models. The empirical evidence assesses the sensitivity of asking price to either energy consumption (KWh) or carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) with an apparent premium of 3%, and captures an association with efficiency rating from G to F of 1.8% and from F to E of 1.1%. Significantly, the results relating to price responses show a distinct variation between the coast and the cooler climatic zone of the interior. The paper shows that energy efficiency incentive policies should discriminate by climatic areas, and provides a price reference by which to assess the amount of incentives needed to achieve European Union (EU) objectives.

TI  - Optimisation of a social housing for south of Brazil: From basic performance standard to passive house concept
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - The paper aims to discuss the adaptation of a brazilian social housing project to the Passive House standard, by defining the thermal envelope construction fabric for different climates of southern Brazil, from a base line according to the Brazilian performance standard. The study was developed in 4 steps, where a numerical model was set up and runned in a transient regime, using EnergyPlus (R) software. In the first step, the thermal and energy performance of the reference base model was assessed. In the second step, a sensitivity analysis was performed, varying the thermal envelope parameters of the building case study, in order to satisfy the minimum performance of the classification level A, according to the Brazilian Energy Efficiency Regulation (RTQ-R). In a third step, the external envelope of the building was optimised, through a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. In a last step, the numerical model defined according to the Passive House standard was optimised, in order to obtain optimal solutions. Thermal and energy performance and economic viability of the solutions were analysed. Solutions attending to RTQ-R presented additional investment between 26% and 27% and solutions attending to Passive House standard presented additional costs of 39% and 42% for the three bioclimatic zones.

T2  - ENERGY
AB  - Nowadays, due to environmental issues sustainability becomes more popular among industrial firms. In this regards, governments follow the energy-efficiency programs (EEPs) to control and reduce energy consumption in all the world. In this paper, we investigate a novel sustainable supply-chain consists of an energy-efficient manufacturer, inefficient manufacturer, and energy supplier that participation in an EEP. Also, we propose an extended utility function for household energy consumers, besides assuming industrial energy productivity as government's utility function and energy rebound of the technological efficiency improvement of the production process, for the first time. To design an effective program, a multi-stage game model is proposed under two scenarios, i.e. tax deduction and subsidy scheme. Then, we present equilibrium decisions as well as a sensitivity analysis in details. The results indicate that considering energy rebound can close profit calculations to the reality. Additionally, the tax deduction is a more effective policy than subsidy scheme to support the energy-efficient manufacturer in competition with similar manufacturers. However, subsidy policy provides better conditions for the government to control the energy consumption of the household sector using energy price reform. The present study clears the application of sustainable development participation in an industrial EEP. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Uneven Price Impact of Energy Efficiency Ratings on Housing Segments. Implications for Public Policy and Private Markets
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In the literature, there is extensive, although in some cases inconclusive, evidence on the impact of Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) on housing prices. Nonetheless, the question of whether such an impact is homogenous across residential segments remains highly unexplored. This paper addresses this latter issue utilizing multifamily listing data in metropolitan Barcelona. In doing so, first the entire sample is analyzed using a hedonic model. Second, the sample is split on the basis of a multivariate segmentation. Finally, separated hedonic models are specified again. The results suggest that in general, there is a modest impact of EPC ratings on listing prices, nonetheless it is not homogeneous across housing segments: (1) for the most modern apartments, with state-of-the-art features and active environmental comfort, energy ratings seem to play a null role in the formation of prices; (2) conversely, for the cheapest apartments, apartments boasting the most basic features, and apartments located in low-income areas, the brown discount is enormously significant, potentially depreciating the equity of those who have the least resources to carry out an energy retrofit. These results have implications for the assessment of the EPBD and its Spanish transposition, since a very well-intentioned environmental policy could have potentially harmful social repercussions in the absence of corrective measures.

TI  - Assessment of Energy-Related Technological Shocks Within a CGE Model for the Polish Economy
T2  - GOSPODARKA NARODOWA
AB  - Despite the increasing popularity of computable general equilibrium (CGE) models in energy-economy-environment analyses, Polish data still provide a modest disaggregation of energy-related sectors. Hence, CGE modellers need to disaggregate corresponding products and industries on their own - to not only obtain more detailed insights, but also avoid the problem of an "aggregation bias". The aim of this paper is to test for such a bias in Poland's case using a small open economy, CGE model called GEMPOL, with an in-house split of energy sectors. Three alternative versions of the model are calibrated and solved. The first version includes energy sectors in their original breakdown. The second version includes their in-house split, with particular values of Armington elasticities derived directly from "parent" sectors. In the third version, Armington elasticities are increased in order to reflect the higher degree of international competition for smaller sub-products. Through a simulation shock, imposed under comparative-statics mode, an exogenous energy efficiency improvement is modelled. Finally, the results obtained from all the variants of the model are compared. It turns out that the simulation results produced by both aggregations and all three specifications of the model are similar from the macroeconomic perspective, but they vary significantly between different aggregations at the sectoral level.

TI  - E-ring: A Non-Invasive Electricity Consumption Monitoring System
T2  - 2019 IEEE JORDAN INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (JEEIT)
CP  - IEEE Jordan International Joint Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (JEEIT)
AB  - Monitoring electricity consumption has a key role in reducing energy consumption. This monitoring can be frequent (several times per week) or continuous. Recent studies showed that such monitoring can reduce residential energy consumption by as much as 15%. The development of energy management systems in the monitoring systems and intelligent energy meters have been going for a while. In this paper, we will present a new electricity monitoring device called "E-ring". E-ring is a non-invasive tool mainly made from a current transformer clamp meter that clamps to the main electricity cables of the user's home and measures the electrical consumption and sends the measured data to an online server and then makes it accessible from the user's mobile phone using a specially-developed mobile application. It has many advantages such as low data rate, low price, and real-time access to the consumption data and simultaneously calculate the estimated price for the household/industrial electricity bill with a tolerance of around 2%.

TI  - Tearing down the information barrier: the price impacts of energy efficiency ratings for buildings in the German rental market
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Improving the energy efficiency levels of the housing stock is of particular concern in the private rental market where capital costs and utility cost savings are not shared in equal measure by landlords and tenants. This problem is particularly pronounced in the German housing market with its predominance of rented accommodation over owner occupancy. The present study is the largest to date to investigate the effect of energy efficiency ratings on rental values. Using a semiparametric hedonic model and an empirical sample of nearly 760 thousand observations across 403 local markets in Germany with full hedonic characteristics, we find evidence that energy-efficient rental units are rented at a premium. However, this effect is not confirmed for the largest metropolitan housing markets. In a second step, a survival hazard model is estimated to study the impact of the energy ratings on time-on-market. It is found that energy inefficient dwelling have longer marketing periods and are hence less liquid than their more energy efficient counterparts.

TI  - Building automation system for grid-connected home to optimize energy consumption and electricity bill
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - This paper proposes an algorithm for coordinated control of the distributed generators integrated to a DC microgrid (DCMG), in islanded and grid connected modes of operation. The proposed DCMG connects photovoltaic (PV) panels, energy storage (i.e. battery bank and hybrid vehicle) and public utility access to supply the load of a house. The integration of distributed sources with DCMG depends on their feed in tariff (i.e low feed in tariff high integration priority). Moreover the microgrid electricity price is the function of feed in tariff of a power source, and their power feed in the DCMG. Therefore, DCMG prices are dynamic. The non energy storable appliance (NESA) and energy storable appliance (ESA) control algorithm has been proposed for load controlling. The electricity price is one of the parameter for ESA control algorithm. The ESA control algorithm shifts the operating time of energy storable appliances without affecting the user comfort to optimize the electricity bill with the same amount of energy consumption. The control action of NESA control algorithm depends on the occupant presence and other parameters such as illumination, temperature in the house. So the NESA control algorithm reduces the energy consumption in the house as well as cost of the energy. The SCADA system is used to interface with the smart sensors of the house and to execute the NESA and ESA control algorithms to switch the appliances. The results from a case study of a home in Alinagar (India) is presented in this paper in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of the load control system and to analyses the luminous, and temperature conditions and occupancy obtained through the application of this technology. The environmental and energy performances, together with the degree of users satisfaction and acceptance of this control system, were analysed for a day to verify the potentiality and operation of this load control system. The obtained results regarding the potential in savings of energy (31%) and electricity bill (35%) were evaluated taking into account both the monitored annual electric energy consumption (for operation) and the parasitic energy consumption due to the installed devices (sensors and controllers), and were compared with the estimated energy consumption with manual load control.

TI  - How different are dwellings whose energy efficiency impacts price formation?
T2  - 4TH WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY CIVIL ENGINEERING-ARCHITECTURE-URBAN PLANNING SYMPOSIUM - WMCAUS
CP  - 4th World Multidisciplinary Civil Engineering-Architecture-Urban Planning Symposium ( WMCAUS)
AB  - Housing energy-efficiency has become a relevant issue since it is mandatory to exhibit an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) when transacting real estate in the European Union. A number of studies have focused on energy-efficiency marginal prices using hedonic models from cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives. Some of them have found that the increase of relevance of EPC ranks (i.e. marginal prices) is not the same for all the A-G classes. This study aims to explore the differences in terms of architectonic and location attributes between the apartments depicting an increase of EPC ranking marginal prices regarding those where energy efficiency seems not to play a role in price formation. In doing so, a pooled spatial error hedonic model is done using selling information for multifamily housing in Barcelona for the years of 2014 and 2016. Furthermore, it is shown which EPC ranks do exhibit an increase in terms of marginal prices in the period studied. Finally, we compare the architectonic and locative attributes for the set of homes where the energy efficiency has increased in terms of price importance to the set of homes where it has not increased. The results suggest that dwellings with high and medium EPC ranks (e.g. A for 2014; and B, C and D for 2016) are more expensive, larger and boasting of better architectonic qualities than the rest of homes where EPC ranks failed to have a role in price formation. On the contrary, the location attributes are different: while A-ranked dwellings of 2014 are located on peripheries where new housing completions are placed; B, C and D-ranked homes of 2016 are located in more centric locations. These findings have implications for future analysis regarding the energy premium and energy poverty, since specific characteristics in different submarkets may have a different impact on housing prices.

TI  - Do smart grid innovations affect real estate market values?
T2  - AIMS ENERGY
AB  - To date photovoltaic energy systems have been widely installed on homes in Europe and all over the world. In Europe and in Italy investments in domestic photovoltaic power plants (PV) were boosted by generous feed-in tariffs that made these investments extremely attractive for small private investors, such as homeowners. It is commonly agreed that the greater the building energy efficiency, the greater the property market value. It is of paramount importance to determine the value that PV systems may add to home sale transactions. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether Smart Grids (SGs) innovation can increase market values due to higher production and consumption flexibility. SGs give de facto producers and consumers, the opportunity to be active in the energy market and strategically decide their optimal production/consumption pattern. In this paper, we provide a model based on the real option theory to determine the value of this flexibility and the related market value increase. We model the homeowner decision to invest in a solar home with a PV plant and connect to an SG by comparison to the decision to invest in a solar home not connected to an SG. We determine the property potential market value increase due to the opportunity to perform active energy management given by smart grids and we compare this value increase to the PV plant value per se. To capture the value of managerial flexibility we implement a real option approach. Results of simulations, performed according to zonal prices' trend and volatility in the North and South of Italy, show that in the North and in the South, being connected to an SG increases by about 5-10% the PV investment's value and this quota increases as energy savings and flexibility increase. The greater the flexibility, the greater the property market value.

TI  - Environmental Performance of Commercial Real Estate: New Insights into Energy Efficiency Improvements
T2  - JOURNAL OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
AB  - This article provides new insights into the performance of commercial real estate, focusing on the environmental performance of institutional assets. The authors employ a proprietary dataset of energy consumption data that includes more than 26,000 buildings between 2009 and 2018. They document that, in their sample of commercial real estate, the median energy intensity decreased by more than 40% over the decade. Using a difference-in-difference analysis, the authors find that adoption of environmental building certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is associated with significantly lower energy consumption and that there is substantial variation in these effects, depending on certification level and program, and label tenure. Moreover, specific interventions aimed at improving the energy efficiency of buildings considerably reduce ex post energy consumption, with effects varying based on local climatic conditions.

TI  - Optimizing the Life Cycle Costs of Building Components with Regard to Energy Renovation
T2  - COLD CLIMATE HVAC 2018: SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS IN COLD CLIMATES
CP  - 9th International Cold Climate Conference (HVAC)
AB  - Considering the high share of residential buildings in the total energy use in Sweden, having the ambitious national energy and climate goals in mind, the real estate sector and its issues have been under a lot of attention during the past few decades. The Swedish real estate sector has often been identified with its ambitious public housing program during the record years (1960-1974). This was at the time the largest housing program per capita in the world where more than a million apartments were built in a nation with a population of 8 million. These apartments once being the pride of a nation, are facing a lot of problems today, ranging from vacancy and unacceptable physical condition to very poor energy performance. These buildings at the verge of their service/economic life are in need of extensive maintenance and renovation measures. Considering the technological development today, the problem with maintenance and renovation remains to be the financial constraints. These are what makes planning for maintenance and renovation complicated and cost inefficient. Although there are tools that can help property managers with maintenance and renovation planning, they all fail to address the complexity of the decision-making process in a multi-objective criteria under financial and time constraints. In this study, the focus is on the life cycle economy of the building components subject to energy performance improvements during renovation. A systematic approach has been proposed that can be used to budget and plan renovation with regard to energy efficiency under budget constraints. This approach utilizes a modified condition/deterioration model of the method Schroeder to simulate the maintenance effect on the condition state of building components in order to obtain the cost-optimal maintenance regime under given restrictions. This methodology can be used to compare the cost effectiveness of different energy-renovation scenarios and determine the optimal renovation plan for a single or a combination of buildings with regard to owners' objectives and existing constraints. The results from this study illustrates how prioritizing action plans can affect the life cycle costs of building components.

TI  - The importance of life-cycle based planning in maintenance and energy renovation of multifamily buildings
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - Improving the energy performance in the real estate sector has become increasingly important and drawn a lot of attention during the past few decades. Despite all the technological developments, the energy efficiency measures are yet expensive and when implemented only to improve the energy performance, are rarely economically justified. To lower the costs of energy performance improvements, an alternative is to combine energy efficiency measures with already required renovation measures. The problem with renovation on the other hand, is that its planning is not strategic; it is mainly opportunistic, short-term and with the focus on the capitalization of newly discovered opportunities, meaning that renovation measures are coupled when one or more of the rather costly building components have reached failure. The take on an opportunistic approach, however convenient, results in loss of value which is most often neglected in the economic evaluation of renovation projects. The lack of strategic planning and the subsequent loss of value become more important in less-attractive markets, where there are both budget constraints and socioeconomic issues. Energy performance and/or living standard are often sacrificed through improper distribution of resources as the choice of renovation measures are often influenced by the return of investment. Therefore, a proper evaluation of renovation alternatives not only can satisfy the technical and financial requirements but also help maintain proper living standard and improve the energy performance in multifamily buildings. In a prior study, authors have proposed a systematic approach to cost-optimal maintenance and renovation planning by combining the deterioration function of building components with respective service-life cycle costing. This paper presents an extension of that methodology to include the energy efficiency option pricing as an optimization criterion. The extended methodology is meant to provide support for housing owners in building management in forms of technical and economic evaluation of possible energy-renovation scenarios under time/budget constraints. To demonstrate the application of the methodology, maintenance/renovation plans are devised for three building components with sharing fixed costs (windows, faoade and roof) in both new and existing multifamily buildings.

TI  - ENERGY INTENSITY OF A BUILDING IN THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE MARKET VALUE OF A RESIDENTIAL UNIT
T2  - EKONOMIA I SRODOWISKO-ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Under current Polish legislation, the valuation of real estate should take into account the results of energy performance certificates and indications of for potential improvement of this performance which are economically viable and technically achievable. The Polish market of energy certificates is young. However, there are energy-intensive data that can be included in property valuation in the absence of energy performance certificates, especially in the case of residential units. The article proposes a way to assess the multi-family building's and its individual units' energy performance on the basis of information such as the location of the unit in the building, the consumption of heating units, the unit's (its living room's) sun exposure. Based on the analysis of the local real estate market (selected homogeneous housing estate in Szczecin), statistically significant relationships between the transaction price of a flat and its pricing features were sought, in particular those characterizing the energy intensity parameters of flats and buildings. The research is devoted to the current and important problem of including energy values in property valuation, but first of all it is important to improve the awareness of buyers and real estate professionals about the costs of heat energy and their impact on sustainable development.

TI  - CFD analysis of a hybrid, Darrieus-Savonius, horizontal wind turbine, using static and moving mesh
T2  - MODERN TECHNOLOGIES IN INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING VII (MODTECH2019)
CP  - 7th International Conference on Modern Technologies in Industrial Engineering (ModTech)
AB  - Changes in the ecological spirit of the world lead to the need for usage of additional ways of obtaining clean energy. With help comes solutions to use wind energy. In the world, there are numerous commonly used, various kinds of wind turbines of different sizes, numbers of generated power and the different place of use. They are increasingly used as household wind turbines to improve the ecology and a marked decrease in household spending. Moreover, it was decided to use an innovative, previously unused connection of two separate types of wind turbines. The approach to turbine positioning is also innovative. Due to the use of its horizontal orientation and purpose to mounting on the roofs of the buildings, to do not exceed the specified size limits in building regulations. It also allows increasing the number of applications of this solution. With the use of Darrieus - Savonius turbine increasing of the range of the wind speeds, which are able to spin a turbine is achieved. In the case of higher efficiency, the Darrieus turbine operates at high wind speeds, while the Savonius turbine at lower wind speeds. Two separate solutions have been coupled with each other by claw clutch, which allows the rotation of only one part or two parts of the turbine depending on the prevailing wind conditions. The CAD model of the turbine was made and then the turbine was subjected to advanced CFD analysis. Initially, analysis of the air course around the turbine was performed, using statistical and analytical data on wind speeds prevailing in Poland, within the areas of single-family houses. The approximate values of the wind flow streams and the torque which ultimately is moving the electric generator were determined. The subsequent CFD analysis was performed using the moving FEM mesh, mapping the actual velocities of the turbine blades. The turbine blades revolved at velocities close to the obtained analytical speed of the shaft and turbine components. Airspeeds were analysed in the case of the shape of the flow of streams. The pressure of the air around the turbine was also analysed, the value of which could be used to add strength analysis using FEM method. The main purpose of the test was to determine the torque acting on the engine. Thanks to this information, it was possible to determine the energy efficiency of the turbine and select the appropriate elements, such as the generator, bearings etc. The obtained information has also had an impact on the final shape of the turbine's executive elements. Thanks to performed analysis, it was possible to obtain proper turbine performance parameters without conducting expensive, real, experiments. In the end, the prototype of this Darrieus - Savonius turbine was manufactured.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE SUSTAINABLE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
CP  - 2nd International Conference on the Sustainable Energy and Environmental Development (SEED)
AB  - Main parameters of a microclimate that could influence people behaviour and comfort are: temperature, carbon dioxide level, relative humidity, noise and lighting intensity during the day and evening. During analysis of energy efficiency the most important factor is temperature and many researches concentre only on this one, however it is necessary to maintain a proper indoor air quality. In this paper we show results of measurements conducted in selected dormitory areas in Poland and Spain, using an instrument TSI 9565, as a part of the research project "The possibility of the renewable energy sources usage in the context of improving energy efficiency and air quality in buildings and civil constructions". Buildings differed not only in climatic data but also in their construction (heat transfer coefficient values, materials), air change rates (ACH), density of occupation etc. Moreover data obtained during our research was compared with a theoretical model of changes in CO2 in time. In case of three tested rooms, CO2 concentration was in a recommended range during all measurement period, while in one house even an initial value was too high. Temperature was found between 19.0 degrees C and 24.4 degrees C.

TI  - Mobile Tiny Houses - Sustainable and Affordable?
T2  - SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT D-A-CH CONFERENCE 2019 (SBE19 GRAZ)
CP  - Sustainable Built Environment D-A-CH Conference (SBE)
AB  - The topic of,affordable accommodations" has affected the construction industry and the politics for many years, not least due to sharply rising real estate prices. Building plots in good locations are just as prohibitively expensive for young people as larger apartments in urban areas, especially in big cities. This raises the question: How much does a person need to live? Energy efficiency, sustainability and regionality are as equally important as coziness, which decisively defines the quality of life of the residents. As part of the "klimaaktiv" regional partnership, the Upper Austria University of Applied Sciences has carried out several research projects concerning the topic of small sustainable homes. In cooperation with an Upper Austrian prefabricated house company, a building technology concept for an innovative modular construction system was devised. The aim here was the development of an innovative, highquality and inexpensive modular system that does not exclude increased ecological standards. As part of an interdisciplinary project, a group of students developed an energy self-sufficient cabin for almost every kind of application. Based on extensive research on existing building systems, a variety of topics were examined. The focus here was on mobility, modular assembly, ecological materials, self-sufficiency, energy efficiency and the water cycle. In the end, a singlefamily house, which considers most of the aforementioned aspects, was built.

TI  - Unfired Clay Bricks with Additives and Mechanical Simulation of Perforated Bricks
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2019 7TH INTERNATIONAL RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY CONFERENCE (IRSEC)
CP  - 7th International Renewable and Sustainable Energy Conference (IRSEC)
AB  - Construction industry is and has always been a flourishing industry in the whole world. Today, with the global development especially in technology, real estate construction is growing more than ever and is continuously using new techniques and methods. However, cost remains a big challenge specially to developing and under developed countries where people in urban as in rural areas can't afford expensive materials and construction methods to build their own houses with. As a result, companies in the construction industry are highly competing, and several researches are being held in this field in order to find the best and most cost and energy efficient building materials and techniques. In the first part of this paper, unfired clay bricks samples were prepared using three type of additives: Palm fronds, date pits and limestone, with different percentages. The mechanical properties, illustrated in compressive and flexural strength, were reviewed, to then suggest recommendations as the outcome of the study. It was found that date pits are the most preferable additive to strengthen unfired clay bricks. In the second part, a mechanical simulation for perforated bricks was done in SolidWorks software to analyze the effect of the number of holes and their distribution on the mechanical properties of the brick

AB  - Organizational and technological reliability in the construction industry is the ability to maintain performance parameters within specified limits and to obtain a planned result under given production conditions. Carrying out repair and reconstruction works always requires large resource costs, so it is necessary to increase the efficiency of using the work with the application of new approaches to the organization of repair and reconstruction works at the real estate. To do this, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of managing a complex of works on the preservation and reproduction of real estate. It is necessary to effectively improve organizational and technological reliability with the help of competent mathematical tools to justify the strategy of repair work. For reliable functioning of the construction strategy, it is necessary to take into account the loss of reliability during repair and reconstruction work at the real estate. It is at this point that this article is based.

TI  - How Relevant is Energy Efficiency in The Marketing of Homes? Evidence from Real Estate Agents in Spain
T2  - 4TH WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY CIVIL ENGINEERING-ARCHITECTURE-URBAN PLANNING SYMPOSIUM - WMCAUS
CP  - 4th World Multidisciplinary Civil Engineering-Architecture-Urban Planning Symposium ( WMCAUS)
AB  - In order to foster informed transactions, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive has made it mandatory to get an Energy Performance Certificate in the marketing of the Communitarian Real Estate. Due to energy savings and environmental preservation, it is expected that efficient buildings do receive an increased willingness to pay. The evidence coming from a number of statistical studies has confirmed the existence of such premium. Nevertheless, such finding is contradictory in relation to the conclusions of opinion-based studies. This paper seeks to study whether energy efficiency drives market price and the marketing of homes in Spain. In doing so, a survey applied to realtors across the country has been implemented. The results are in line with other opinion-based studies pointing out that energy performance has a negligible impact on the marketing of homes. Furthermore, real estate agents suggest that companion policies in the sphere of subsidies and fiscal exceptions are needed in order to bring energy efficiency to the first line of elicitation attributes in the residential market.

TI  - Public costs and private benefits: the governance of energy efficiency in India
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - India has demonstrated that it is possible to reduce energy demand and increase the energy efficiency of its buildings, particularly for air-conditioning appliances. Given the rapid and large expected increase in India's building stock over the next 20 or more years, the opportunity exists to make significant increases in overall energy efficiency and reduce energy demand through the application of its Energy Conservation Building Code that influences the design, construction and operation of buildings. However, the responsibility for this code resides with local authorities (urban local bodies) that currently lack sufficient incentive to implement and enforce it. To overcome this impediment, it is argued here that important benefits can be captured by local authorities to implement energy-conservation measures: increased revenues from taxes, improved attractiveness to business and citizens, and the introduction of automation to reduce transaction costs in the building-approval process. Large parts of the country's property (real estate) are yet to be built, providing a valuable opportunity to transition to low-energy and climate-friendly solutions in India's rapidly growing building stock.

TI  - Developing of a ventilation system for residential houses with solar air heater
T2  - XXII INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE: CONSTRUCTION THE FORMATION OF LIVING ENVIRONMENT (FORM-2019)
CP  - 22nd International Scientific Conference on Construction - The Formation of Living Environment (FORM)
AB  - Ventilation of buildings in winter period, especially in cold climatic conditions, requires rather big quantity of heat for preheating the ventilation fresh air. Consequently, an average low-income family pays a tangible cost for ventilation of apartments. To provide low cost ventilation of houses it is becoming attractive the use of solar energy for preheating the outside fresh air, before its supplying into the house. For this purpose, cheap solar air heaters are needed. To solve this problem a simple and cheap construction of solar air heater was developed, which is the main part of the ventilation system. The system consists of air heating solar collectors, installed on the roof of the house, warm air distribution ductwork, internal air circulation ducts and air-circulating fan. In summer period, the system is used only during nighttime period for circulating outside colder air through the internal space of the house. Such operation allows cooling internal air and as well the constructions of the house. As a result, the house accumulates nighttime natural cold for using it at daytime cooling purposes. Presentation includes the scheme, explanation of operation and method for design of suggested ventilation system. Analysis proved the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of the new system.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE CONFERENCE SPBWOSCE-2018: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGIES FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT
CP  - International Scientific Conference on Business Technologies for Sustainable Urban Development (SPbWOSCE)
AB  - At the present stage of world economic development, great attention is paid to ensuring sustainable development, including the low energy intensity of industrialized economies. In view of this, the various methods, approaches and mechanisms for energy saving and energy efficiency are of particular importance. One of the most relevant non-state mechanisms is an energy service contract (performance contract). There are preventive mechanisms that have not yet been imposed on market participants, but are capable of qualitatively changing the company's policy regarding the conservation of resources. The goal of the research is to form an understanding of the potential for applying modern energy saving and energy efficiency mechanisms in Russia and the EU. To achieve this goal, the study provides an overview of the current state of the energy service market in these countries, the conditions and directions of its development, identifies key problems in the application of the energy service contract and assesses its potential. A comparative description of the practice of application of the energy service contract and systems of certification of projects and real estate in Russia and the EU is given.

CP  - 4th International Conference on Safety Problems of Civil Engineering Critical Infrastructures (SAFETY)
AB  - The construction sector covers various activities for the final consumption of energy resources, which have different consequences for energy consumption. Heating, cooling and lighting of premises for which most industrial energy consumption accounts for most of the energy consumption of buildings depend not only on the energy efficiency of the temperature and lighting control systems, but also on the efficiency of the buildings in which they are operating. The lack of generally accepted approaches to a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the introduction of new energy efficient technologies, raw materials and equipment serves as a barrier to increasing the energy efficiency of domestic construction and overhaul of MAB. The article considers measures to increase energy efficiency during overhauls, which allow to reduce expenses for provision of housing and communal services and increase the market value of housing in the real estate market.

CP  - International Conference on Climate Resilient Cities - Energy Efficiency and Renewables in the Digital Era (CISBAT)
AB  - The market value of physical assets varies over time as a function of different factors. These factors are related, for instance, to the correct execution of construction works and installation of systems, the procedures for the operation of systems and equipment, the continuous implementation of maintenance operations and to the location and the perceived value. However, there is no clear evidence, in Italy, of how buildings' market value is affected by the energy performance measured by the Energy Performance Certification (EPC), promoted thanks to the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive in order to drive the assets' energy efficiency. The aim of the research is the definition of a methodology for the identification of the impact of the energy performance on the market value of the assets. An analysis of the market values of assets has been carried out based on a public database. On this basis, an investigation of homogeneous assets' price areas has been performed. The results have been geolocated and further processed, which allowed to associate differences in the market values to the energy performance retrieved from the Certificazione Energetica degli EDifici (CENED) database (the Italian regional EPC database). The buildings included in the analysis are residential buildings distributed in the regional territory (Lombardy Region). The methodology has been tested at national level but is potentially scalable in different contexts. It has been developed and applied in two case studies, cities with different size and characteristics located in the northern Italy.

TI  - The Role of Housing and Services in Supporting Healthy Ageing-in-Place: Northern British Columbia, Canada
T2  - AGER-REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS SOBRE DESPOBLACION Y DESARROLLO RURAL
AB  - Rural ageing is a common process across Northern Europe, the Scandinavian countries, and across OECD states more generally. In rural Canada, this demographic process has been accelerated by the phenomena of resource frontier ageing; the result of a combination of youth out-migration, workforce ageing-in-place, and the long-term lack of new job growth to attract young working households. In this paper, we look at the critical issue of housing in northern British Columbia (BC), Canada, as a vital part of healthy ageing and quality-of-life for older residents. We start with an overview of the important policy shifts that have impacted housing investment, the processes which have accelerated population ageing, and the match/mismatch of the existing housing stock with new demographic realities. The findings highlight that the processes of economic upswings and downturns so common in resource-dependent rural and small town places has had a significant impact not only on patterns of demographic change, but also on the nature of the existing housing stock and on the capacity of that stock to meet the needs of the local population into the future. In our case study community, the housing stock is generally old, larger than required by current households, and in need of repair or updating. These findings mirror resource region housing studies elsewhere. Updating this stock needs focus specifically upon accessibility within the dwelling unit for the growing demographic of older residents and on energy efficiency to reduce house operating costs for retired people living on low or fixed incomes. There are also unmet housing needs in terms of smaller, accessible housing for people wishing to downsize and there is a lack of support services to help keep older people in their own homes longer. The research points to the need for both housing investment and revisions to public policy.

TI  - A survey of private landlords in Karlsruhe and their perception of deep energy retrofit
T2  - SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT D-A-CH CONFERENCE 2019 (SBE19 GRAZ)
CP  - Sustainable Built Environment D-A-CH Conference (SBE)
AB  - Energy use related to buildings accounts for 35.3% of Germany's final energy consumption and nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, deep energy retrofit (DER) has a substantial role in the German energy efficiency strategy. Although many DER measures are economically viable, the pace of DER is below expectations and target value. A few studies investigated this phenomenon and conducted surveys mostly among owner-occupiers. However, 54% of the 40.5 million apartments in Germany are rented and a total of 15 million are let by private (not professional) landlords. Therefore, this investigation focuses on private landlords to find out what drives or constrains them to do deep energy retrofitting. A survey was conducted in a quarter of Karlsruhe, a large city in Germany with an above-average demand-driven real estate market. In this quarter, 83.2% or 8464 apartments are rented. 85 private landlords who own 10% of the rented residential buildings in the quarter responded and gave insight into their perception of DER. The results show that the buildings of the respondents originate from a construction period with large saving potential. Main strategies for investments in DERs are conservation of economic value of the property and the compliance with legal requirements. The main trigger is required maintenance. Despite an eco-friendly attitude, ecological criteria have a minor part in the DER decision. Finally, policy recommendations are made.

TI  - THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ENERGY POVERTY FOR THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF CROATIAN ECONOMY
T2  - 8TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM ECONOMY OF EASTERN CROATIA - VISION AND GROWTH
CP  - 8th International Scientific Symposium on Economy of Eastern Croatia - Vision and Growth
AB  - Energy poverty in developed countries is a consequence of the abolition of government intervention in energy prices as well as high energy prices. The aim of this paper is to research quality of measures to combat energy poverty. The implemented methodology included an analysis of measures to combat energy poverty in European countries and analysis and quality of Croatian measures to combat energy poverty. The combat energy poverty can only be carried out with high quality measures while bad measures send the wrong image to customers. While access to energy is one of the ways to combat poverty, high energy price affects a lot of people who cannot pay for it. Furthermore, incentive measures aimed at developing renewable energy sources and energy efficiency requirements increase the energy price. High-income households can invest in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, but low-income households cannot replace the appliances with high energy consumption with those that have lower consumption. Hence, their energy consumption (that is higher than the average) has a significant impact on their economic status and social inclusion. The first research on poverty in the Republic of Croatia was carried out by the World Bank and the Croatian Central Bureau of Statistics in 1998, when 4% very poor households were detected. Newer research resulted with a higher percentage of those who are not able to ensure adequate heating in the coldest months. The results of this research point out that Croatia does not have good measures to combat energy poverty because the measures included a significantly smaller number of households with extremely large funds.

AB  - The dimensions of real estate which begin as spatial within time added, and the time being includes ecological and economic self-history besides the sociality with cultural capitalized values influenced by technology and ethics. The aim of this paper, is to discuss the philosophy of value and valuation methods described for sustainable real estate development within its dimensions introduced here as Sigma SoCulT Xi (Sigma stands for eco-system, economic and ethics; SoCulT stand for socio-cultural values and T also for technical, and Xi is history which stands also as a base of first three concepts) which the environment built by Anthropocene view. Built environment, in a way, is strategically designed by the construction industry, which is shaping and re-shaping the environment, which has the most powerful influence on the "economic capital and environment" in terms of adding value to the real estate leverage in the significance of genius logi. The so-called sustainable real estate has to power the highest and best use with functionality, energy efficiency, resource intensity, environmental compatibility, health, socio-cultural aspects, life cycle coast and technical quality to measure value/earning/worth. Value of sustainable real estate development, composed of the architectural design of built environment within sustainable architectural principles, approaches, constructional criteria, and methods. The evaluation of this composition includes, the investment on potential idea pending the realization of real estate, which is called earned capital, and the captured value as intangible assets at any stage of life-cycle of the real estate is also called earning/worth. The dimensions which are hidden in the facts of development of sustainable real estate valuation design which are captured in the Sigma SoCulT Xi will be discussed by comparison as the method of sustainable architectural design, application, and life-cycle of a real estate and its valuation principles. Comparing the principles both the architectural design includes the engineering projects and the way of real estate valuation, we as designers may lead also the strategical perspective of economic investment. As a conclusion, the possible cross-info flow of these approaches has to become the shared values in the strategical planning, flow from concept to concept to keep the dimensions of real estate development in the sustainable reality.

AB  - Within the framework of the concept of sustainable development, issues of energy efficiency, environmental safety, minimization of anthropogenic impact on the environment are of particular relevance. In construction, these theses are projected onto the segment of energy-efficient, "green" construction. Nowadays, the development of energy-efficient construction in Russia is progressing at a slow pace, and this is primarily due to the lack of an integrated energy management system, environmental certification of construction products, and institutional features of the real estate market. The authors systematized the methods of improving energy efficiency and greening of construction regarding the types of real estate, analyzed the main global and Russian environmental certification systems in construction, identified the features, advantages and disadvantages of each system, substantiated the need to ensure the generally accepted Russian certification system. The problem of enhancing energy-efficient construction is also interconnected with the need to increase the level of innovation in construction, which is substantiated by the authors in the paper. The authors substantiated the need to change the criteria for monitoring investment projects, taking into account the optimization of energy efficiency and environmental performance of real estate.

AB  - During the 1970s, the urban landscape of the major cities in Romania has suffered significant changes. The rapid growth of the urban population, even doubled in some cases has led to an increased demand on the housing market. In order to quickly provide new homes, standard housing units using large reinforced precast concrete components (LRPCC) were used. Today, these units' house more than half of the urban population. Buildings have a high energy demand during their life cycle starting from construction to demolition and are one of the main factors responsible for the negative impact on the environment. Therefore, applied LCA strategies on the built environment, in the last years, has developed into a distinct working area within other LCA practices. This is not only because of the complexity of a building but also due to numerous factors that make this sector so unique. Firstly, buildings are designed to have a long lifetime, usually more than 50 years. Currently LRPCC housing units have not yet even reached half of their intended lifespan and are now failing to meet the modern living standards Secondly, with the constant changes of daily routines, social lifestyle and needs, buildings usually undergo changes in their forms and functions. This aspect can be as significant or more, than the original element. Third, a building has the highest impact on the environment during its use. Therefore, proper design and selection of materials are important to minimize the in-use environmental loads. LRPCC buildings have a huge energy savings potential and because they are project types, extensive retrofitting strategy on the whole building, extending to the community, can be implemented. By taking the ISO 14040 and 14044 standards into consideration, a Life Cycle Assessment on energy efficiency is carried out on a chosen LRPCC collective housing unit in four distinct phases following an iterative process, to evaluate the behaviour of the building components, materials and systems before and after the retrofitting process.

TI  - Who lives in and owns cold homes? A case study of fuel poverty in Seoul, South Korea
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - The study aims to identify residence groups that are highly vulnerable to fuel poverty in the urban area of a South Korean city. Thereby, the paper emphasizes that fuel poverty problems occur in different ways according to the social and spatial contexts and thus need a more contextualized policy approach beyond the simplistic criteria of household income and heating cost. To fully capture the meaning of cold homes, an empirical dataset of thermal efficiency of individual dwellings and actual heating in a residential area in Seoul, South Korea is examined along with the tenure type and the ownership attributes. The analyses reveal that the amount of actual heating energy consumption did not show any clear relation with the thermal efficiency of housing or the tenure type. Additionally, considerably inefficient dwellings like old, detached houses are occupied by elderly owners who often lack both the financial capability and intention to properly maintain their properties. The result indicates that people who are living in cold homes are not always confined to poor residents living in rented homes. The study proposes some new types of potential fuel poverty based on the analyses of thermal efficiency and heating patterns by dwellings.

TI  - A Data-Driven Approach to Energy Cost Prediction Of Dwellings Based on Partitioned Parallel Modeling
T2  - 2019 IEEE 43RD ANNUAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE (COMPSAC), VOL 2
CP  - 43rd IEEE-Computer-Society Annual International Computers, Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)
AB  - In today's modern society, residential dwellings make up a large proportion of the world's energy consumption. Therefore, predicting dwellings' energy consumption and needs are highly useful for energy conservation and evaluating future demand. Data-driven energy consumption prediction models are widely researched to forecast energy consumption of buildings. However, in the majority dies, the training data is collected through smart energy meters and sensors of some target sample buildings. Thus, the source of data intrinsically restricts the usable range of prediction models, In this paper, we build a set of innovative partitioned parallel prediction models include Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) to predict annual heating costs, hot water costs and lighting costs of dwellings. The model training and valuation procedures are basing on the data of the Standard Assessment Procedure and Energy Performance Certificate (SAP-EPC), covering all 13 main regions in the United Kingdom. The feature selection comparative experiments prove that the merge feature selector can select valid feature sets according to different prediction targets The comparative experiment results manifest the fact that the parallel modeling approach can improve the model's accuracy. Meanwhile, the experimental results indicate that the proposed prediction models can accurately forecast the energy consumption of the dwellings.

TI  - The value of residential energy efficiency in interior Alaska: A hedonic pricing analysis
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Residents of Interior Alaska are faced with a cold climate and relatively high energy prices, which results in high home energy expenditures. Increasing the energy efficiency of the housing stock can help reduce household energy expenditures. Following a spike in oil prices in 2008, legislation was passed, which created the Home Energy Rebate Program. Homeowners participating in the program were eligible to receive up to a $10,000 rebate for preapproved home energy efficiency improvements. This paper examines the effect of the Home Energy Rebate program on the selling prices of single-family residences in the Fairbanks North Star Borough from 2008 through 2015 using a hedonic pricing analysis. The results show that homes that completed the Home Energy Rebate program in the Fairbanks North Star Borough sell for a 15.1-16.5% price premium over similar homes that did not complete the program, which indicates that investments in residential energy efficiency are compensated. This is the first study to examine the impact of energy efficiency on house prices in a market with a subarctic climate.

TI  - The Value of Energy Efficiency and the Role of Expected Heating Costs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS
AB  - The German Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires sellers on the housing market to provide detailed information on expected yearly energy consumption per square meter (energy performance, EPS). This paper uses variation in local fuel prices and climate, fuel types, and building ages to analyse the relationship between expected energy cost savings from energy efficient building structure and house prices in a data set of listing prices from all regions of Germany. Results suggest that heating cost considerations are less relevant than previously thought.

TI  - Energy efficiency retrofits in the residential sector - analysing tenants' cost burden in a German field study
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - With the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and curbing climate change, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings with energy efficiency retrofits is an important task. In Germany a large share of the residential building stock is rented. This comes with barriers to energy efficiency retrofitting due to split incentive problems. Alongside existing government incentive programmes, the German tenancy law allows landlords to add a maximum of 11% of the energy-related modernisation costs onto the annual rent. Studies evaluating the actual outcomes, from an energy as well as a social point of view, are rare. This article compares calculated theoretical heating energy consumption for prior to and after retrofit with actual consumption data after retrofit. Further, the issue of household expenses is addressed by comparing increased rental costs after retrofit with household's energy expenses prior and after retrofit. Despite a reduction in energy consumption of 70%, more than half of the households faced increased costs due to higher rents after retrofit. Even when increases in energy prices are taken into account, still one third of the households faced higher costs. For a fairer and more effective distribution of costs and benefits, this article stresses the importance of alternative financing models.

TI  - Optimisation of a high-efficiency solar-driven organic Rankine cycle for applications in the built environment
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
CP  - 30th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimisation, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems (ECOS)
AB  - Energy security, pollution and sustainability are major challenges presently facing the international community, in response to which increasing quantities of renewable energy are to be generated in the urban environment. Consequently, recent years have seen a strong increase in the uptake of solar technologies in the building sector. In this work, the potential of a solar combined heat and power (CHP) system based on an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine is investigated in a domestic setting. Unlike previous studies that focus on the optimisation of the ORC subsystem, this study performs a complete system optimisation considering both the design parameters of the solar collector array and the ORC engine simultaneously. Firstly, we present thermodynamic models of different collectors, including flat-plate and evacuated-tube designs, coupled to a non-recuperative sub-critical ORC architecture that delivers power and hot water by using thermal energy rejected from the engine. Optimisation of the complete system is first conducted, aimed at identifying operating conditions for which the power output is maximised. Then, hourly dynamic simulations of the optimised system configurations are performed to complete the system sizing. Results are presented of: (i) dynamic 3-D simulations of the solar collectors together with a thermal energy storage tank, and (ii) of an optimisation analysis to identify the most suitable working fluids for the ORC engine, in which the configuration and operational constraints of the collector array are considered. The best performing working fluids (R245fa and R1233zd) are then chosen for a whole-system annual simulation in a southern European climate. The system configuration combining an evacuated-tube collector array and an ORC engine is found to be best-suited for electricity prioritisation, delivering an electrical output of 3,605 kWh/year from a 60 m(2) collector array. In addition, the system supplies 13,175 kWh/year in the form of domestic hot water, which is equivalent to more than 6 times the average annual household demand. A brief cost analysis and comparison with photovoltaic (PV) systems is also performed, where despite the lower PV investment cost per kWel, the levelised energy costs of the different systems are found to be similar if the economic value of the thermal output is taken into account. Finally, a discussion of the modelled solar-CHP systems results shows how these could be used for real applications and extended to other locations.

TI  - The influence of energy considerations on decision making by institutional real estate owners in the U.S
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Large bodies of literature investigate the energy and resource impact of green buildings on consumers, environment, rent and society. However, little research exists that examines the habits and decision-making preferences of owners who operate and invest in these buildings. Industry interviews with senior-level representatives of U.S.-based institutional real estate owners (e.g. REITs, Pension Funds, Opportunity Funds, and Investment Managers) were conducted to assess energy reporting, data tracking, labeling preferences and upgrade decision making. The interviews revealed that EnergyStar and GRESB are primary reporting outlets, with LEED also relevant. Energy tracking mechanisms were quite disparate, ranging from custom built systems, EnergyStar Manager, third party providers or limited tracking. Upgrades were primarily driven by cost-benefit analysis and not sustainability-related motivations. This research shows that energy efficiency and tracking mechanisms have become the norm for institutional owners and investors.

TI  - HEAT COST ALLOCATION IN MULTI-APARTMENT BUILDINGS: A LITERATURE REVIEW
T2  - LATVIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND TECHNICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Literature review aims at examining various scientific articles on the accounting methods of individual heat consumption and heat cost allocation.
   Nowadays, accounting methods of heat consumption and heat cost allocation in multi-apartment buildings are a topical issue. Heat and water supply is one of the key services provided to residential buildings and their residents. Residents appreciate solutions that allow them consume as much heat as they need and are able to pay, but on condition that the calculation methodology is understandable and easy to perceive.
   Directive 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of Buildings adopted by the European Parliament and the Council (Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, 2010) stipulates that owners or tenants of buildings shall be provided with the information on energy efficiency measures, their goals and objectives, cost effective ways to improve the energy performance of a particular building and, where appropriate, in the case of available financial instruments to improve the energy performance of a particular building.
   The aim of the research is to perform literature analysis using topical articles on the accounting methods of individual heat consumption and heat cost allocation, which are published in the Web of Science and Scopus scientific databases, by analysing and comparing the published results.

TI  - Beyond economicsunderstanding the decision-making of German small private landlords in terms of energy efficiency investment
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - The German government aims to achieve virtually climate-neutral building stock by 2050 to tackle climate change. To realise this goal, comprehensive policy packages based on neoclassical economic theory are in place to foster energy efficiency investment. However, in the building sector, there is increasingly a gap between this aspiration and the reality. It is claimed that one of the main reasons for this is that the existing policy framework fails to address the specific characteristics and needs of different groups of building owners. This is a particular challenge in Germany, where 80% of all dwellings are owned privately and 37% are rented out by small private landlords (SPL). Despite the significant numbers of SPL, they often follow black box decision-making processes when considering energy renovations. In this study, the author uses an explanatory model to understand the decision-making processes of SPL, combining theoretical aspects from different research disciplines. This model was applied to a low-demand housing market in a neighbourhood in the Ruhr area. Eighteen semi-structured interviews (each lasting between 37 and 115min) were conducted, demonstrating that in addition to economic factors, the values, beliefs, norms and routines of SPLas well as their personal capabilities and contextual factorsplay an important role in their decision-making. Based on the findings, recommendations are made for enhancing the effectiveness of existing energy efficiency policies and other supporting instruments (e.g. tenancy law and social legislation), tailored to the specific needs of SPL.

TI  - The remaining potential for energy savings in UK households
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Progress on improving energy efficiency of UK homes has stalled in recent years and the question arises how much more potential for further energy savings exist across the housing stock. Whilst there are some high-level estimates of the potential for buildings energy efficiency in the UK, a more granular assessment is needed to understand exactly where this potential lies and what form it takes. Our analysis fills this gap. It is based on the best available evidence on the remaining potential for energy efficiency improvements within UK residential buildings. Using UK government criteria for investment appraisal, we demonstrate that there is a significant resource of untapped energy-saving opportunities in UK homes. Specifically, our estimates suggest that: one quarter of the energy currently used in UK households could be cost effectively saved by 2035; and this could increase to one half if allowance is made for falling technology costs and the wider benefits of energy efficiency improvements. However, these estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made about capital, energy and carbon costs, and capturing this potential will require both significant policy change and large-scale investment.

TI  - Modelling household spatial energy intensity consumption patterns for building envelopes, heating systems and temperature controls in cities
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
CP  - 30th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimisation, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems (ECOS)
AB  - This paper explore the benefits of a bottom-up spatially enabled engineering building-based energy framework in identifying neighbourhoods, and community's building aggregated areas with spatial patterns. We argue that an area-based approach allows more houses to be targeted in places where local area characteristics show inefficient elements, and may therefore potentially capture a greater number of households per unit of cost, compared to the existing self-referral methods. We propose a spatial method to show the extent of building envelopes, heating systems and temperature controls. Heating controls, which are not recorded in the United Kingdom Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), but we believe would be considered good practice to maintain balanced temperatures around the house, and also potentially reduce the complexity in modelling the thermal zones. Additionally, heating controls are seen as compulsory in new building regulations, an eligible measure in Green Deal and Energy Company Obligations, and in the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) heat strategy. This paper has taught us that the emerging picture surrounding local energy modelling and that, for example, singularities such as group heating and district heating (decentralised energy supply) have a great impact on final energy consumption calculations.

TI  - SUSTAINABLE MICRO-VILLAGES AND THE CARWOOLA HOUSE PROJECT IN CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Our needs as social and familial beings change over the course of our lives; however, it has become common practice to build as though these needs remain static through time. The needs of a child, young adult, family, middle age and the elderly are dynamic between generations, and adding to these evolving life needs is the crisis of housing affordability. Three decades ago a house could cost 3-4 times an individual's annual income, today that cost is closer to 10-12 times. In response to these challenges, this article explores the concept of Sustainable Micro-Villages, providing insight into a new approach to energy-efficient housing with reference to our case-study project-Carwoola House.
   Sustainable Micro-Villages can be defined as a cluster of integrated dwellings, referred to here as Living Pods. Essentially a "single house" on a single site, these micro-villages can be comprised of two or more smaller buildings that provide private dwelling space for a single person, couples, couples with children, parents, elderly, friends and any combination of social groups. Living pods cluster around a natural garden setting, enhanced by waterharvesting, and are connected with covered, open or enclosed links depending on the climate of the site. The recent iterations of this type of dwelling also incorporate solar passive design, passive house and greenhouse technology.
   In Australia, new house designs are evaluated as part of an approvals process for their energy rating. 1 The Australian Building Code requires a minimum 6-star rating, ranging up to 10 stars for any new home to be built. A 6-star rating provides a good level of insulation and energy performance if built correctly, while 10 stars represent the highest level of energy performance and refers to a dwelling that needs no heating or cooling. Sustainable Micro-Villages consistently achieve an 8 to 10-star rating by combining Solar Passive Design principles (good orientation, thermal mass and thermal performance) and Passive House Technology (high thermally performing building with low air leakage, no thermal bridging, high performance glazing and heat recovery ventilation) in various combinations to suit the climate, context and budget.

TI  - Does energy efficiency matter to real estate-consumers? Survey evidence on willingness to pay from a cost-optimal analysis in the context of a developing country
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In most countries, energy efficiency at the residential level has been largely delegated to the dynamics of real-estate markets after setting a minimum level. This regulatory definition is in certain cases supplemented by energy performance certificates, such as in the case of the European Union. This approach is based on the understanding that avoided energy-consumption costs positively affect the willingness to pay for them, thus leading to higher prices capable of offsetting production costs and thereby encouraging developers. The case of the private housing market in Santiago de Chile was selected as a reference for a developing country in which energy performance certificates, although they exist as an instrument, are not required to be applied in property transactions. However, unlike most of the research performed in developed countries, it is difficult to analyse price formation using methods based on observed preferences in areas in which there are few energy-certified buildings. Using the technique of contingent valuation, such as the method based on stated preferences, enables one to overcome this difficulty. This article investigates willingness to pay for improvements in the energy efficiency of buyers for new homes based on a representative investment/operation cost analysis. This approach has been addressed to open the debate on the convenience of modifying the national construction code and rethinking the energy certification scheme as well as an exploratory study to undercover further research lines to support the aforementioned discussion. The results suggests that there is a number of potential home buyers ready to pay for energy efficiency when they are informed on the cost savings associated to structural modifications and the cost of providing such improvements and such willingness to pay is not monolithic across the respondents, but seems to be influenced by the education level plausibly associated to the purchase power.

TI  - Does voluntary disclosure create a green lemon problem? Energy-efficiency ratings and house prices
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper seeks to elucidate whether high levels of non-disclosure lead to adverse market outcomes in the form of the well-known lemons problem. It also empirically tests whether energy-efficiency ratings (EERs) are reflected in both housing sales prices and rents in the Australian Capital Territory, the only Australian housing market with mandatory ratings for all dwellings at point of sale or lease. Using a comprehensive dataset of sale and lease transactions during the period 2011-2016, a hedonic framework is applied. The analysis confirms that both the reported energy-efficiency levels and other sustainability-related characteristics that are not part of the formal rating assessment influence the pricing of both sales and rental transactions. Characteristics such as heating and cooling systems and the presence of solar power generators are significantly reflected in rents and sales prices, as tenants and buyers are likely to estimate their expected utility costs based on the EER. It is also shown that the option of leaving the EER of a rental property unreported presents a moral hazard for landlords of sub-standard properties, in that the likelihood of EER disclosure increases in line with the number of energy-efficient features of a property as revealed in the marketing material. The analysis also reveals that socio-economically disadvantaged areas suffer from disproportionately higher levels of EER non-disclosure, potentially constituting a 'double disadvantage' of non-disclosure and low-energy efficiency dwelling stock. From a market and asset-pricing perspective, it thus seems preferable to extend the requirement to obtain and present a valid EER to the rental market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intersection of the global climate agenda with regional development: Unequal distribution of energy efficiency-based renovation subsidies for apartment buildings
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The residential sector is an important target area for achieving Europe's 2020 energy saving aims. There is virtually no evidence, however, of how incentives for attaining energy efficiency interact with countries' regional development aims. This article presents recent experiences from Estonia, where an energy renovation subsidy programme financed with carbon emission trading funds was carried out between 2010 and 2014. We show that despite equal access to subsidies for residents living in various places, a regionally unequal distribution of subsidies occurred. Empirical analyses confirm that low-performing regions acquire less public subsidy, thus adding another layer of regional inequality to existing socio-economic differences. Findings suggest that renovation subsidy distribution is related to regional socio-economic indicators and that real estate value explains 40% of subsidy distribution variations between regions. Although the energy policy goal of carbon conservation is important, ignoring the location and organisational capacity of local communities results in missed opportunities to mitigate growing regional disparities.

TI  - Composite fuel poverty index as a means to assess energy security of the country
T2  - ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI
AB  - Introduction. The issues of strengthening Ukraine's energy security are related to addressing the insufficient understating of its essence, nature and criteria for assessing the vulnerability of the national economy. The need to improve the existing methodology for calculating the overall performance of energy security assessment is considered to be relevant due to the insufficient level of research on related issues and inconsistency of individual aspects. The composite fuel poverty index by region provides information on energy efficiency of households in different regions and helps to assess the level of poverty of the regions derived from the analysis of the consumption of fuel and energy resources by households in the regions, the pricing policy in Ukraine's energy market, as well as the income and expenditure level of households. The purpose is to develop a methodology for determining the composite fuel poverty index by region, revealing the principal factors of its formation, and to identify ways of improving the country's social and economic security in the context of energy market deregulation. The results of the study reveal indicators that allow assessing the consumption of fuel and energy resources by households by region in qualitative and quantitative terms, taking into account the nonlinearity of economic processes in the context of economic transformation. The problems relating to the implementation of social and economic policy of the state are revealed in the context of the Ukrainian energy market deregulation. The authors of the research have developed an analytical model of the energy inefficiency of Ukrainian regions, as well as a model for estimating the fuel poverty index of relevant regions (FPIi) by using the monetary poverty indicator Pi and the energy inefficiency indicator Ici, i.e. the cost of all energy resources consumed by average households of a region calculated as a unit area. In the 2012-2016 period, the fuel poverty index was established in the range from 0.5 to 0.65. However, the index fluctuations are affected to a great extent by increases in prices on fuel and energy resources, with a high value of the index being indicative of a low level of personal income and high expenditures on fuel and energy resources for Ukrainian households. Conclusion. The calculation of the composite fuel poverty index makes it possible to determine the regions with low incomes and high energy consumption with regard to 1 sq. m of household area. The proposed methodology can become an integral part of the analytical assessment of regions' energy security. The calculation results for Ukraine show that the share of fuel and energy costs as part of household costs exceeded 10% of households' income threshold for 2012-2016, resulting in low living standards of the population and hardship in meeting basic needs. Further increase in fuel and energy prices will bring about an increase in social tension.

TI  - THE "INSURANCE EFFECT": HOW TO INCREASE THE INVESTMENT AMOUNT IN GREEN BUILDINGS - A MODEL-BASED APPROACH TO REDUCE THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY GAP
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - Real estate is an industry sector with high potential to increase energy efficiency. However, many of the existing green building investment opportunities (GBIO) are not utilized because economic valuation tools are complex and oftentimes difficult to understand. For this reason, we develop a formal, but comprehensible bottom-up model to determine the optimal investment amount from an economic perspective, placing particular emphasis on the descriptive valuation of risk, and point out the applicability of GBIO as insurance against energy price volatility. We also give examples of the model's potential application. Our work shows that considering the insurance effect will increase the optimal investment amount and that certain investment amounts lead to both economic and ecological benefits in properties and property portfolios. Our findings can be used for a comprehensible enhancement of existing valuation methods and tools to reduce the energy efficiency gap (EEG). They constitute a quantitative basis for the adaption of laws to counteract the current underinvestment in the real estate sector.

TI  - The Incentive to Overinvest in Energy Efficiency: Evidence from Hourly Smart-Meter Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
AB  - Many households pay a marginal price for electricity that exceeds the marginal social cost of supplying that electricity. We show evidence that such pricing schemes can create an incentive to overinvest in energy efficiency. Using hourly smart-meter data for households facing time-invariant increasing block prices, we estimate how air conditioner upgrades affect electricity use. We find that the average participating household reduces consumption by 5%, which provides private savings in the form of lower electricity bills and social cost savings by decreasing generation and pollution costs. The private savings exceed the social savings by an average of 140%, so the average household is faced with an incentive to overinvest in energy efficiency. This incentive to overinvest in energy efficiency would be cut in half if consumers faced any one of three alternative pricing plans with lower marginal price but the same average price.

TI  - Influence of Adaptive Comfort Models in Execution Cost Improvements for Housing Thermal Environment in Concepcion, Chile
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Most of the operational energy needed by the housing sector is used to compensate energy losses or thermal gains through the building's envelope. As a result, any improvement in the thermal behavior will provide important opportunities to reduce energy consumption. This research analyzes improvements in the thermal envelope in social housing in the Greater Concepcion area in Chile using adaptive thermal comfort models and thermal insulation investments. The objective set out is to evaluate the economic reduction of thermal envelope improvement costs for dwellings, which entails using the adaptive thermal comfort model obtained through monitoring and the surveys applied to the users of social housing in Concepcion (CAS), against the international adaptive thermal comfort models established by the EN 15251: 2007 and ASHRAE 55-2017 standards. Finally, it is concluded that, on having applied the social housing adaptive thermal comfort model (CAS), execution costs are reduced by between 28.8% and 58.2%, reaching a time of comfort in free oscillation similar to that obtained from applying the models of the EN 15251: 2007 (74.2%) and ASHRAE 55-2017 standards (59.9%).

TI  - Why are rented dwellings less energy-efficient? Evidence from a representative sample of the US housing stock
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper compares energy-efficient appliance adoption rates across U.S. residential markets. The focus is to explore variation across tenure modes (rented or owner-occupied residences). Bivariate probits are used to correct for endogenous determination of tenure mode and energy efficiency outcomes. Results suggest that, when compared to renters, homeowners are significantly more likely to have energy-efficient appliances. The mechanisms that could be driving those differences are also investigated. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that rented dwellings are more likely to have efficient appliances when landlords incur utility payments. Adoption rate differences are also shown to be inversely related to energy prices. Those findings are consistent with a problem of asymmetric information in the housing market, typically referred to as the "landlord-tenant problem." This paper is also the first to assess how tenancy duration influences efficiency investments in this context. Results suggest that investments in rented homes are more likely to occur at later periods of tenancy, when relations between landlords and tenants might be better established.

TI  - Growth of industrial CO2 emissions in Shanghai city: Evidence from a dynamic vector autoregression analysis
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the main sources of global warming, rising sea levels, and frequent outbreaks of extreme weather. China is now one of the largest energy consumer and CO2 emitters in the world. As one of China's economic centers, Shanghai city has a perfect industrial system with large industrial scale. The industrial sector is an energy and emission intensive industry, which contributes the significant part of CO2 emissions in Shanghai city. Therefore, an in depth investigation of the main driving forces of CO2 emissions in the industrial sector is essential to reduce CO2 emissions in the city. This study uses Vector Autoregressive model to analyze the main factors causing the increase in CO2 emissions in the industrial sector. The results show that economic growth leads to an increase in CO2 emissions in the short run, but is conducive to reducing CO2 emissions in the long run, due to the differences in fixed asset investment and export trade. Energy consumption structure leads to a growing CO2 emissions in the short term, and is beneficial to mitigate CO2 emissions in the long term, owing to the gradual optimization of energy consumption structure. However, urbanization helps to reduce CO2 emissions in the short term, but leads to an increase in CO2 emissions in the long term, because of urban real estate and infrastructure construction investments as well as vehicle use. Energy efficiency leads to an increase in CO2 emissions both in the short and long run since the scale effect exceeds the technical effect. Industrial structure produces a positive effect in the short run, but the impact is gradually narrowing in the long run. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The elephant in the energy room: Establishing the nexus between housing poverty and fuel poverty
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on fuel poverty by bringing together the "housing-cost-induced-poverty" definition and the "low-income-high-cost" indicator. Relying on the housing-cost-induced-poverty definition, this paper identifies three "dimensions" of fuel poverty: 1) income-poverty-high-cost; 2) housing-cost induced-poverty-high-cost; and, 3) fuel-cost-induced-poverty-high-cost. After breaking down the underlying structure of the low-income-high-cost framework, this paper proposes an alternative conceptual definition of fuel poverty and puts forward an empirical strategy which can help to identify the households most in need of financial and energy-related support. An application based on energy cost data in England allows us to identify several policy implications following from our proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy retrofit alternatives and cost-optimal analysis for large public housing stocks
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The study of cost effective solutions for the energy retrofitting of existing buildings is of capital importance for building asset owners, since high up-front investments are required and long payback times are encountered in building renovation projects. The aim of the work is to propose a decision support system (DSS) for the assessment of different renovation strategies through the measure of their economic sustainability in relation to the achieved energy efficiency. The cost optimal analysis of energy retrofit alternatives is performed in the case of a large housing stock owned by a semi-public real estate company, with the goal of meeting nearly zero energy building standards. Energy performances as well as related energy and construction costs are analysed for different retrofit options, adopting Italian laws and regulations. The proposed DSS evaluates the economic sustainability of various design alternatives with the net present value (NPV) and the global cost (GC), as suggested by the EPBD recast EU directive. These indicators are finally compared with the building energy performance index (EP), providing the most efficient design alternatives for each building typology and the most advantageous renovation project among the considered ones.

TI  - A European Project for Safer and Energy Efficient Buildings: Pro-GET-onE (Proactive Synergy of inteGrated Efficient Technologies on Buildings' Envelopes)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The paper describes the progress of the four-year European project Pro-GET-onE currently under implementation. This research and innovation project is based on the assumption that greater efficiency, attractiveness, and marketable renovation can only be achieved through an integrated set of technologies where all the different requirements (energy, structural, functional) are optimally managed. Thus, the project focuses on the unprecedented integration of different technologies to achieve a multi-benefit approach that is provided by a closer integration between energy and non-energy related benefits. The project aims to combine different pre-fabricated elements in a unified and integrated system resulting in a higher performance in terms of energy requirements, structural safety, and social sustainability. The project attempts to achieve this goal through the introduction of innovative solutions for building envelopes to optimally combine the climatic, structural, and functional aspects through a significant architectural transformation and a substantial increase of the real estate value of the buildings. This augmented value obtained through the application of the inteGrated Efficient Technologies (GETs) is extremely important when considering the necessity of creating an innovative and attractive market in the energy renovation of existing buildings towards the target of nearly zero energy buildings (nZEBs).

TI  - CARBON EMISSION-BASED MEASUREMENT OF FLOOR AREA RATIO BONUS FOR RESIDENTIAL GREEN BUILDINGS IN CHINA
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Green building development in China relies mainly on compulsory measures that lack incentive policies to motivate the enthusiasm of real estate developers. A floor area ratio bonus is encouraged by the Chinese State Council. In order to ensure the feasibility of a reward quota, residential buildings that met the requirement for energy efficiency during the official assessment in Ningbo in 2014 were selected as research objects. The amount of energy and water savings in terms of the Assessment Standard for Green Building is converted into carbon emissions. Carbon emissions of different star-rated green buildings are then measured in accordance with the actual water and power consumption of residential dwellings in 2014. A regression equation is set up concerning the floor area ratio and index for residential land per capita. A carbon emission-based method is proposed for measuring the reward quota associated with floor area ratio and recommendations are given for development using green building.

TI  - You can't take it with you: Appliance choices and the energy efficiency gap
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In the U.S. real estate market, some types of appliances are expected to convey (be included) with the sale of a house, while other appliances may or may not convey depending on local norms that vary at the state level. An appliance that conveys will be left behind when a homeowner moves, while an appliance that does not convey may be kept until the end of its useful life. I estimate the effect of an appliance conveying using a difference-in-differences across states and appliance types, allowing me to fully control for state-level trends with fixed effects. I find that consumers purchase less expensive refrigerators and clothes washers when those appliances convey. This result indicates that the value of these appliances are not fully capitalized into home prices. I further show that accounting for whether an appliance conveys can substantially reduce or eliminate apparent undervaluation of energy efficiency benefits. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Cost-effective passive house renovation packages for Swedish single-family houses from the 1960s and 1970s
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - This paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of renovating single-family houses to Passive House level, as compared to maintaining the existing buildings or renovating to building regulation level. The assessment involved life cycle cost analyses, and concerns the Swedish single-family housing stock constructed between 1961 and 1980, which accounts for about a third of Sweden's two million single-family houses. These houses, now in need of major renovation, are represented in this study by two reference buildings. The results show that Passive House renovations can be cost-effective, but this largely depends on the type of heat generation used in the houses. The most cost-effective individual renovation measure was installing an exhaust air heat pump, and the least cost-effective was installing new windows. In houses using direct electric heating, the Passive House renovation package was the most cost-effective alternative. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - What cause large regional differences in PM2.5 pollutions in China? Evidence from quantile regression model
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - China has become one of the most heavily polluted countries in the world with China's air pollution attracting claims from some international media of its spread to neighboring countries such as Korea and Japan, in order to bring to the concern of the international community. PM2.5 (fine particles) pollution is one of the main sources of China's air pollution. The detrimental effect PM2.5 pollution poses on health of residents and its hindrances to transportation has attracted the attention of many scholars who have conducted a wide range of investigations on PM2.5 pollution. However, in spite of the avalanche of research on PM2.5 pollution in China, majority of the existing studies in terms of methodology has usually investigated air pollution using the averaging method. In fact, the data distribution of socio-economic variables is often non-normal, with the tail having hidden important information. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing research, this paper uses a quantile regression approach to explore the main driving forces of the difference in PM2.5 pollution under high, medium and low emission levels. The results show that the effect of economic growth on PM2.5 pollution in the upper 90th quantile provinces is the highest in all the quantile provinces due to the differences in fixed-asset investment and export trade. The impacts of energy efficiency in the 75th-90th and upper 90th quantile provinces are stronger than those in the lower 10th, 10th-25th, 25th-50th, and 50th-75th quantile provinces because of a big differences in research and development (R&D) funding and R&D personnel investment. The case of industrialization was similar on account of the differences in the industrial and building sectors. How-ever, the empirical evidence showed that influences of urbanization in the 25th-50th and 50th-75th quantile provinces were lower than those in the other quantile provinces owing to the differences in motor vehicle and real estate industry. Thus, the heterogeneous effects of these driving forces on the different quantile provinces should be taken into consideration when discussing the mitigation of PM2.5 pollution in China.

TI  - Application of life cycle assessment approach to deliver low carbon houses at regional level in Western Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB  - Purpose Australian building sector contributes 23% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is particularly important for Western Australia (WA) as the houses here are made of energy-and carbon-intensive clay bricks. This research has utilized life cycle assessment (LCA) approach and cleaner production strategies (CPS) to design low-carbon houses in 18 locations in regional WA.
   Methods An integrative LCA analysis of clay brick house has been conducted by incorporating energy efficiency rating tool (i.e., AccuRate) to capture the regional variation in thermal performance of houses in 18 locations in WA under five climatic zones. The data bank provided information on energy and materials for mining to material production, transportation of construction materials to the site of construction, and construction stages, while an energy rating tool has been utilized to generate location-specific information on energy consumption during use stage for developing a life cycle inventory for estimating life cycle GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption of a typical 4 x 2 x 2 detached house (i.e., 4 bed rooms, 2 bathrooms, and 2 cars/double garage). This approach has enabled us to determine the location-specific hotspot of a house in order to select suitable CPS for achieving reduced level of GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption.
   Results and discussion Except for two hottest locations, the average life cycle GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption of houses at 16 locations in regional WA have been estimated to be 469 t of CO2 equivalent (or CO2 e-) and 6.9 TJ, respectively. Home appliances and water heating have been found to be the top two hotspots. The CPS options, including rooftop solar photovoltaic panels (PV), solar water heaters (SWH) integrated with gas based water heaters, cast in situ concrete sandwich wall, fly ash as a partial replacement of cement in concrete, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam made of post-consumed polyethylene terephthalate bottles, have been considered to reduce GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption of a typical house in 18 locations in regional WA. Excluding above two hottest locations, these CPS provide an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption per house by an average value of 320 t CO2 e-and 3.7 TJ, respectively.
   Conclusions Considering the alarming growth rate of the housing industry in WA, the incorporation of optimum house orientation, rooftop solar PV, roof top SWH, cast in situ sandwich wall, partial replacement of cement in concrete with fly ash, and PET foam insulation core could reduce the overall GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption associated with the construction and use of clay brick wall house which in turn will assist in achieving Australia's GHG emission reduction target by 2050. The findings provide useful data for architects, designers, developers, and policy makers to choose from these CPS options based on existing resource availability and cost constraints.

TI  - 'Getting the measure of fuel poverty': The geography of fuel poverty indicators in England
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Recognition of the negative impacts of fuel poverty, a lack of sufficient energy services in the home, has generated considerable interest in how the phenomenon can best be measured. Subsequently, the most well-known indicators deployed in policy-making, the established 10% indicator and the recent Low Income High Cost (LIHC) indicator, have generated considerable discussion and critique. One facet of the debate that remains unexplored is the effect of a change in indicator upon the spatial distribution of fuel poverty. Using spatial analyses we interrogate sub-regional estimates of the two indicators in England, where the LIHC indicator was first conceived. Three principle findings are discussed, enhancing understanding of the geographic features of fuel poverty as understood by each indicator. Firstly, the reduction in fuel poor households has disproportionately affected areas with lower housing costs. Secondly, there is a higher prevalence of fuel poverty in urban areas. Finally, the condition is more spatially heterogeneous with fewer 'hot-spots' and 'cold-spots'. As a result, each indicator captures different notions of what it means to be fuel poor, representing particular vulnerabilities, losses of wellbeing and injustices. This has implications for the targeting of limited alleviation resources and for alternative national contexts where the LIHC indicator might be deployed.

TI  - Adoption of Energy Star certifications: theory and evidence compared
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - Energy Star, the largest voluntary housing eco-labelling programme in the US, conveys important signals to housing market actors about the energy efficiency of homes. With energy demand from housing being a significant energy consumer and contributor to climate change, gaining insight into the diffusion patterns of these certifications is an important analytical step. Informed by theories of new product adoption, research is used to identify the factors associated with the diffusion patterns of Energy Star certifications into US single-family housing from 2002 to 2013. The findings are generally congruent with recent studies of energy-efficiency adoption patterns in commercial property (real estate) and residential building construction. The key significant predictors of variation in the proportion of Energy Star-certified homes across US core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) are found to be public policy, climate, market attributes, industry characteristics and energy prices.

TI  - Turning green into gold: A review on the economics of green buildings
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Adoption of green design and technology in buildings, which can mitigate negative impacts on the environment, has been recognized as a key step towards global sustainable development. In addition to technology development, economic viability plays a pivotal role in stimulating the design, construction and use of green buildings. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent studies on the economic viability of "going green", including cost-benefit analyses from the perspective of building life cycle and from the perspective of major market participants. While "going green" is more likely to be seen as profitable from the building life cycle perspective, economic viability, from the perspective of developers and occupants, remains unclear due to information, behavior and policy factors. Such discrepancy in the results regarding economic viability is one major reason for the "paradox" of the very gradual diffusion of apparently cost-effective green buildings in most economies. We also propose several key topics that merit future research, including more comprehensive evidence about life-cycle costs and benefits of green buildings, the incorporation of ancillary long-term or intangible benefits in the analysis of economic viability for developers and occupants, an investigation on the dynamics of the adoption of green buildings, and institutional arrangements for stimulating green practices in the building sector.

TI  - Thermally Comfortable Housing in Iraq-Prospects of the Courtyard Pattern in Achieving Energy Efficiency
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 3RD INTERNATIONAL SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS SYMPOSIUM (ISBS 2017), VOL 1
CP  - 3rd International Sustainable Buildings Symposium (ISBS)
AB  - Iraq suffers from large housing problems. It is estimated that there is a shortage of around one million dwellings, which is equal to one-fourth of the total housing stock in the country. As a part of the solutions, the country needs architectural designs that satisfy three main conditions: enable an increase of the housing production, be affordable and satisfy people's residential requirements. The latter includes, for instance, providing suitable layouts, comfortable environment and the required level of privacy. Within this spectrum, this paper focuses on providing a thermally comfortable indoor environment. The importance of this aspect is raised by the high temperatures in Iraq, the unreliable electricity supply, reducing the running costs and the need to maintain the environment at comfort conditions. The paper explores the courtyard pattern as an approach to achieve a thermally comfortable indoor environment, and studies how courtyards might be adopted within multistory residential buildings in order to reduce the costs and support the housing production. It reports on an extensive literature review that investigates published scientific studies within the last ten years about the thermal efficiency of the courtyard pattern and its design features. To propose design solutions, the paper considered the investigation's results and the main residential buildings criteria and standards. The research results define the courtyard pattern thermal efficiency and demonstrate the importance of adopting the courtyard pattern's design features to provide a thermally comfortable indoor environment. It also proposes two architectural solutions for Iraq that include using courtyards in multistory residential buildings.

T2  - 2018 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE EUROPEAN ENERGY MARKET (EEM)
CP  - 15th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM)
AB  - This article presents the issue of electricity consumption for space heating purposes. High share of fossil fuels used for space heating leads to high pollution emission. A solution for this problem may be encouraging customers to use electricity as an energy carrier for space heating, by proposing appropriate tariffs. Diverse electricity tariffs for households are described, differing in energy prices and distribution rates in certain periods of a day. Demand price elasticity is calculated by comparing energy increases in zones using standard load profiles of customers settled according to the flat tariff and the time of use tariff. The values of demand price elasticity are then used to create customers' load profiles based on price changes within newly proposed tariffs. A forecast of the consumption rise resulting from the new implemented anti-smog tariff motivating consumers to use electricity during the low load period in the Polish power system is presented.

TI  - Advanced Planning of Home Appliances with Consumer's Preference Learning
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (RCAI 2018)
CP  - 16th Russian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (RCAI)
AB  - For modern energy markets it is typical to use dynamic real-time pricing schemes even for residential customers. Such schemes are expected to stimulate rational energy consumption by the end customers, provide peak shaving and overall energy efficiency. But under dynamic pricing planning a household's energy consumption becomes complicated. So automated planning of household appliances is a promising feature for developing smart home environments. Such a planning should adapt to individual user's habits and preferences over comfort to cost balance. We propose a novel approach based on learning customer preferences expressed by a utility function. In the paper an algorithm based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework is used to infer the user's hidden utility. We compare IRL-based approach to multiple state-of-the art machine learning techniques and the proposed earlier parametric Bayesian learning algorithm. The training and test datasets are generated by the simulated user's behavior with different price volatility settings. The goal of the algorithms is to predict a user's behavior based on the existing history. The IRL and Bayesian approaches showed similar performance and both of them outperforms modern machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, random forest etc. In particular, the preference learning algorithms significantly better generalize to data generated with parameters different from the training sample. The experiments showed that preference learning approach can be especially useful for smart home automation problems where future situations can be different from those available for training.

TI  - Cultural heritage in sustainable development Stone houses as environmental assets in the East Mediterranean
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Purpose - Preservation of historic structures meets ecological criteria of sustainable development. In Mount Lebanon, the traditional house is a cultural asset built of native stone one-meter thick double-wythe walls. Today, lack of public policies is causing those environmental assets to approach extinction. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology uses multivariate regression on 128 data points. A mathematical model is developed and empirically tested on public attitudes toward restoration. Independent variables represent the need for protectionist policies, X1; contribution of restoration to environmental sustainability, X2; contribution to culture, X3; and financial benefits, X4.
   Findings - It is found that stone houses transfer heat significantly slower thanmodern construction. There is a statistically significant and positive correlation with X1, X2, and X3, but negative with X4, most likely due to favoring return on investment of multistory buildings over the attractiveness of stone houses.
   Research limitations/implications - As future research implications, the undergirding of urban planning policies need to be revisited. Current policies neither protect heritage, nor offer legal means to restore heritage houses.
   Practical implications - Practical implications include revisions to building laws in Mount Lebanon, as they marginalize old stone structures. Environmental valuation techniques, use value and existence value, are recommended. Social implications - Social awareness needs to be built about valuation techniques to account for complex assets that cannot be approximated through short-term real estate market price. Social rather than financial cost-benefit analysis must be performed to quantify environmental assets.
   Originality/value - This research illustrates a pilot restoration project with critical issues faced by heritage stone houses. These assets are underrepresented in building laws which warrants social and environmental activism.

TI  - Proof of concept that requiring energy labels for dwellings can induce retrofitting
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - How to induce households to install energy efficient technology remains a puzzle. Could an energy labeling requirement for residential real estate help? We propose that the salient color-letter grades on the English Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) served as targets, motivating vendors to invest in energy efficiency. To test our hypothesis we look to a random sample of over 16,000 homes in England. In the post-EPC data we find a cluster of homes with energy efficiency scores just above the D-grade threshold. This cluster was not present prior to the requirement, replicates in an independently-drawn random sample and is significantly larger amongst properties that can be identified as treated by the EPC requirement. We conclude that the EPC requirement induced investment, and hence that energy efficiency labels have potential to green the housing stock. We infer from our analysis how the design of the EPC could be altered to motivate greater investment in energy efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sustainability Attributes in Real Estate Development: Private Perspectives on Advancing Energy Regulation in a Liberalized Market
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In real estate markets where energy efficiency certificates are not mandatory, such as Santiago in Chile, incorporating solutions that respond to the growing demand for sustainability entails a natural tension between their acceptance as necessary measures and the way they are addressed by the market. Under this mechanism, sustainability attributes have been introduced that are communicated individually through real estate promotion. A methodology consisting of two approaches was utilized to investigate the cross-validation of attributes, in terms of supply and demand, and the evolution of them in 8255 real estate advertisements for the period 2012-2017. Their positioning was more evident in higher-value homes, where they were identified as consolidated attributes, while they are considered innovations at the lower end of the market. However, as evidence suggests, sustainability attributes decline in relative importance over time, ceasing to be considered marks of distinction. This suggests that this model should be reviewed from a public policy perspective, with the understanding that the current voluntary standards must compete with other attributes. At the same time, it is necessary to make progress in the improvement of the obligatory minimum standards with the objective of establishing a more demanding baseline that incentivizes competitiveness in the market.

CP  - 5th IIR International Conference on Sustainability and the Cold Chain
AB  - Reasons for disposal of domestic refrigerators and whether some of the appliances could potentially be re-used was studied. Based on visual inspection, a simple operational test and an electrical inspection, 28% of appliances were considered suitable for re-use. Potentially, these appliances could be provided cheaply or without cost to low income households. It might be unethical to provide low income households with appliances that had high energy use or performance issues, therefore the appliances were tested to compare the temperature and energy performance with their original stated performance. In addition the appliances were compared to current energy efficient appliances. For appliances where manufacturers data was available it was found that 18 (out of 22) appliances used more energy when tested than provided on the energy label, 1 appliance used almost identical energy and 3 appliances used less energy. Compared to current appliances only 5 appliances were better than or equal to an 'A' rated appliance.

TI  - Rheology of Clay and Clay Housing in Bensmim
T2  - 2018 6TH INTERNATIONAL RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY CONFERENCE (IRSEC)
CP  - 6th International Renewable and Sustainable Energy Conference (IRSEC)
AB  - Developing ecofriendly houses using local, low embodied energy construction materials such as clay represents an essential step towards making houses more cost and energy efficient. Ifrane region, and particularly Bensmim counts many low to medium income families that cannot afford high heating bills. This project aims at contributing to the development of the building sector in this region by increasing its energy efficiency through using clay bricks as a main construction material. For this purpose, a series of experimental studies were performed. The first step in this study is based on rheological testing, which allow to first understand the behavior of the clay used. The purpose of the rheological study is not only to understand the behavior of our clay, but also to compare it with three types of clay from different sites (Bab Mansour and ExtraBric manufactory). The effects of addition of wood ash and olive pomace ash to clays from the three sites at various concentrations 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, and 40% were investigated. The purpose of this work is to study the properties of the bricks and to determine a new way of recycling of the wood ash and the olive pomace ash. The major property that will be covered is the compressive strength.

TI  - FROM TOOL-MAKING TO TOOL-USING - AND BACK: RATIONALES FOR ADOPTION AND USE OF LCC
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Real estate- and property owners' rationales behind the adoption of Life Cycle Costing (LCC) respectively how LCC is actually used in renovation projects, is investigated through empirical data from a questionnaire survey sent to managers in Swedish real estate organisations. The study shows a positive attitude towards LCC. It is perceived to as a flexible and multi-functional tool with a familiar monetary format. Nevertheless, the study also reveals simplistic and undeveloped views of how to use LCC. While much research has focused on developing sophisticated LCC tools, the findings indicate that practitioners' interest in these refinements seems limited. The importance of understanding that LCC is used in a context of multiple and partly competing institutional logics of renovation is emphasised. The paper contributes to a more informed research in development of LCC tools as well as better informed LCC use among real estate and property owners.

TI  - Does "clean" pay off? Housing markets and their perception of heating technology
T2  - PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of distinct types of heating technology and their price impact in German residential real estate markets, considering a wide range of other housing market determinants. The authors aim to test and to verify specifically, whether the obsolescence of heating technology leads to a significant price discount and whether higher technological standards (and environmental friendliness) come with a price premium on the market.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors create housing market models for rental and sales segments by constructing generalized additive models with explicit multi-layered spatial components. To elaborate a profound and contemporary answer using these models, the authors perform large-sample regression analyses based on more than 400,000 observations covering German residential properties in 2015.
   Findings First and foremost, the heating system indeed shows significant explanatory importance for measuring housing rents and purchasing price. Second, the authors find that it makes a difference whether clean green technologies are implemented or whether brown systems with obsolete technology or fossil energy sources is on hand. Ultimately, the authors conclude that while low energy consumption indeed comes with a price premium, this needs to be interpreted together with the property's heating type, as housing markets seem to outweigh the green premium by brown discounts if low energy consumption figures are powered by a certain type of heating technology system.
   Research limitations/implications Aside of a possible omitted variable bias, the main research limitation is constituted by the integration of asking prices in the analysis, as actual transaction prices are not systematically transparent on national level in Germany. Limitations are discussed at the end of the paper.
   Practical implications This work supports investors who face the challenge of making environmental- and energy-related decisions as well as appraisers who deliver financial fundamentals for such. Third, the paper supports both asset managers as well as investment strategists in argumentation pro-environmental investments beyond all ecological necessity.
   Social implications This paper contributes to the current discussion on climate change and the eclectic role of real estate in this context. The authors deliver evidence on pricing effects as a measure of socioeconomic acceptance of progressive heating technology and environmental friendliness as an imperative of twenty-first century societies.
   Originality/value This is the first study on green premiums or brown discounts that includes heating technology as a potential and distinct driver of value and rents. It is a contemporary contribution and delivers original information on the quantitative impact of contemporary and anachronistic technology in heating to researchers as well as investors and appraisers.

TI  - An econometric analysis of the household direct rebound effects for electricity consumption in Tunisia
T2  - ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
AB  - The main focus of this paper is to investigate the magnitude of the rebound effect for electricity end uses by Tunisian households. The direct rebound effect is estimated at about 81.7%, suggesting that only 18.3% of energy saving potential has been achieved. Moreover, the results show that removal of electricity subsidy, besides raising terminal electricity price, moderates these residential direct rebound effects. Overall, the rebound-effects are large in Tunisian residential households. Policy makers need to refine, adapt and extend the prevailing political energy efficiency policy to reduce these effects and achieve more efficient energy saving. In addition, they should support energyefficiency incentives with policies that cut down subsidies and increase electricity prices for households. To ensure that this will not affect people in poverty, the subsidy level should be differentiated according to household income level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CP  - 2nd International Conference on Regional Science, Infrastructure Technology and Regional Development (ICoSITeR) - Energy Security for Enhancing National Competitiveness
AB  - Near Zero Energy House (NZEH) is a housing building that provides energy efficiency by using renewable energy technologies and passive house design. Currently, the costs for NZEH are quite expensive due to the high costs of the equipment and materials for solar panel, insulation, fenestration and other renewable energy technology. Therefore, a study to obtain the optimum design of a NZEH is necessary. The aim of the optimum design is achieving an economical life cycle cost performance of the NZEH. One of the optimization methods that could be utilized is Genetic Algorithm. It provides the method to obtain the optimum design based on the combinations of NZEH variable designs. This paper discusses the study to identify the optimum design of a NZEH that provides an optimum life cycle cost performance using Genetic Algorithm. In this study, an experiment through extensive design simulations of a one-level house model was conducted. As a result, the study provide the optimum design from combinations of NZEH variable designs, which are building orientation, window to wall ratio, and glazing types that would maximize the energy generated by photovoltaic panel. Hence, the design would support an optimum life cycle cost performance of the house.

TI  - Solar House Situated in Oradea, Apateului Street
T2  - MODERN TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE 3RD MILLENNIUM
CP  - 17th International Technical-Scientific Conference on Modern Technologies for the 3rd Millennium
AB  - The solar house (Ecohomes concept) is considered to have the greatest energy efficiency. Future energy savings will certainly compensate for the initial investment. This type of dwelling also has the least impact on the environment.
   This paper presents a house that uses Trombe walls, situated in Oradea, Apateului Street and is the property of Sorin Dragan. The dwelling is in the study and planning phase.
   More precisely, the house uses solar energy for heating and cooling. The building itself, made of materials which absorb and store heat from the environment, will function as a huge heat- generator.
   All of these principles may be applied regardless of the house's design. The major assets of such a house are low maintenance costs, the negligible effects on the environment and its autonomy from conventional energy providers.

TI  - Analysing households' responsiveness towards socio-economic determinants of residential electricity consumption in Singapore
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The research of household electricity use is still relatively new for Singapore, where apart from some government surveys and sparingly available papers, not much has been done to understand the underlying socioeconomic determinants that affect residents' energy demand. Here, we seek to quantify price and income elasticities, as well as provide reasonable justification for price asymmetry in Singapore using a panel approach across dwelling types and geographical areas. We find that households do not react much to prices, and that price elasticities may decrease as income rises. There is also some evidence of price asymmetry, with surprising results putting responsiveness towards price decreases larger than price increases. This points towards similar behavioural patterns with the rebound effect for household energy efficiency, if found present in future studies. Our findings suggest that there will only be positive responses towards dynamic pricing and higher churn rates if more transparent information is provided on related cost savings, when households are exposed to retail choice in the electricity market after full retail competition is introduced in 2018. In addition, a large role will have to come from cultivating the young to engage in sustainable practices to achieve energy efficiency targets.

TI  - The Many (Still) Functional Housing Estates of Bucharest, Romania: A Viable Housing Provider in Europe's Densest Capital City
T2  - HOUSING ESTATES IN EUROPE: POVERTY, ETHNIC SEGREGATION AND POLICY CHALLENGES
AB  - Housing estates built during the post-World War II decades in many countries have followed diverging trajectories. These include maintenance and repair, demolition, 'doing nothing,' and demolition with mixed-usage replacements. Drawing on empirical and historical material from Bucharest, Romania, a city in which 80% of the housing stock consists of socialist era housing estates, we argue that such housing continues to be viable and is even enjoying a minor renaissance, mainly through the financial efforts of residents and, occasionally, through the allocation of a certain amount of public funds. The empirical analysis illustrates that it is neither the mass character of such housing, nor its high-rise nature that creates the problems and negative image often associated with housing estates elsewhere in the world. Rather, we outline seven challenges faced by such estates: ageing of their structure and resident population, networked connectivity, energy efficiency, densification, urban planning that favours real estate agents, neglect of housing policies and housing rights, and condominium governance. The housing estates and their problems are so much a part of everyday normality in Bucharest that the local administration tends to take them for granted and has not placed them on the public agenda despite the inevitability of their structural decay at some time in the future. More than anything else, the state and the owners need to gather data in order to preempt future emergencies or continuing physical decay of this valuable housing stock.

CP  - 34th International Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture (PLEA) - Smart and Healthy Within the Two-Degree Limit
AB  - Energy Performances Certificates have been implemented in Spain just in the moment of the largest real estate recession, such situation does not allow to observe consumers' preferences on energy efficient homes. This paper uses choice experiment to study the relative importance of energy efficiency in relation to other functional and quality attributes. In order to evaluate the role of framework information in the formation of household preferences the sample has been split into 2 sets and informed on the economic and environmental implications of energy efficiency using technical and illustrative units. Results suggest that households do give importance to energy efficiency mainly when they are informed in an easy-to understand way. This latter finding has important implications for the design of energy policy.

T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURE
AB  - Statement of the problem. An important reserve for decreasing the consumption of materials of gas pipelines is to increase the operating pressure in the gas distribution system. The introduction of the practice of design of the gas supply system with household stabilizers of pressure requires developments of scientific methods of calculation and design.
   Results. The annual saving of fuel gas due to the pressure stabilization according to experimental research of the authors is 2-3 %. Installation of house regulators gas pressure also ensures saving of fuel gas. In the presence of stabilizers, gas plants operate at a gas pressure close to nominal, i. e. at maximum efficiency.
   Conclusions. The results of the study allow us to conclude about the effectiveness of the use of networks of medium pressure gas with the subsequent reduction to the desired values brownies pressure controllers or regulators-stabilizers. Installation of household stabilizers gas pressure also provides fuel savings. In the presence of stabilizers gas-installations can operate at a pressure of the gas is close to par, i. e. with maximum efficiency. The research results lead to the conclusion about the effectiveness of the use gas network of medium pressure, followed by pressure reduction up to the required values of household pressure regulators or regulators-stabilizers.

TI  - Topology Specialization for Networks-on-Chip in the Dark Silicon Era
T2  - DARK SILICON AND FUTURE ON-CHIP SYSTEMS
AB  - Following Moore's law, the number of transistors on chip has grown exponentially for decades. This growing transistor count, coupled with recent architecture and compiler advances, has resulted in an unprecedented exponential performance increase of computers. With the end of Dennard scaling, however, the power required to operate all transistors at the full performance level simultaneously grows across the technology generations. Consequently, chips will keep an increasing fraction of transistors power gated or dark to remain within the power envelope. The power-gated part of the chip, known as dark silicon, is expected to comprise a significant portion of the die real estate in new technology generations. In addition to power limitations, the limited and nonscalable off-chip bandwidth is the second source of dark silicon. The key challenge to improving performance in the dark silicon era, consequently, is how to efficiently leverage transistors when they cannot all be powered at the same time. Core specialization shows promise in addressing this challenge by improving the performance and energy efficiency of applications. This method leverages the dark silicon to build many diverse power-efficient accelerators and each application only activates a subset of cores that best match its processing requirements. In this chapter, we propose a network-on-chip specialization method that leverages dark routers of a partially active many-core chip to customize the topology for active cores, effectively reducing the power consumption and latency of communication.

TI  - Green pay off in commercial real estate in Germany: assessing the role of Super Trophy status
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose - Based on a hedonic regression approach, the purpose of this paper is to relativize existing green pay off evidence by incorporating Super Trophy as a so far underrepresented determinant. The authors analyze a private panel database of 160 European office properties and confirm a significant green pay off; the positive impact of excellent environmental certification results on market values and net rents is significantly reduced when considering Super Trophy characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on a panel database of 160 European office properties, the survey applies a hedonic regression approach including an extensive set of control factors as, for example, location criteria, general property characteristics, climate adjustments, consumption data, refurbishment activities, green leases, sustainable certification and energy performance certificate figures.
   Findings - Even though our database still confirms a significant green pay off, the positive impact of excellent environmental certification results on market values and net rents is significantly reduced when controlling for Super Trophy characteristics.
   Practical implications - Especially, the question how sustainability can be integrated into real estate appraisal is of major interest. The paper at hand may help in two aspects: on the one hand, it provides further insight with regard to the quantitative impact of Super Trophy Buildings on rents and market values. On the other hand, a higher transparency in appraisals may result in structural specifications that help to consolidate appraisals and empirical evidence on a "green pay off."
   Originality/value - The study investigates a niche segment-landmark properties. The empirical analysis explicitly controls for potential Super Trophy status. It draws attention to the importance of a reasonable and complete set of control variables to increase statistical validity of future studies in that field.

TI  - Carbon footprint trends of metropolitan residents in Finland: How strong mitigation policies affect different urban zones
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Around the world, cities are creating local climate change mitigation strategies and combining strengths in international efforts. In addition to making the strategies, it is important to follow, how they work in practice. The aim of the study is to examine, how climate change mitigation policies and other events affected the consumption-based household carbon footprints in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA) from 2006 until 2012. The cities of the HMA launched an ambitious climate change mitigation strategy in 2007. Furthermore, the study analyses the changes in the carbon footprints of six different types of urban zone within the HMA: the central pedestrian zone, the fringe of the central pedestrian zone, intensive public transport zone, public transport zone, car zone and the pedestrian zones of subcentres. The results of the study reveal that the average carbon footprint decreased 7% from 2006 to 2012, despite 1% increase in expenditure, which is encouraging. Emissions caused by housing energy consumption and motor fuel consumption decreased the most. Among the urban zones, public transport zone and car zone, which are the two outermost zones of the HMA, had the strongest emission reductions. Cleaner electricity and the improved energy efficiency of buildings had a strong effect. The regression analysis of the study suggests that the central pedestrian zone and the car zone, the two most affluent zones of the HMA, have higher carbon footprints than all the other zones have between them. However, this is only true when income is controlled, not when expenditure is controlled. The economic crisis in 2008, and changes in consumption behaviour because of it, seem to explain the result. The reduction of the average carbon footprint in the HMA was not only due to steered mitigation actions. Increased housing costs seem to have contributed to the decline of consumption-based emissions. The results of the study suggest that to achieve the ambitious international, national and local climate change mitigation targets, stronger measures are needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Recycled Materials Impact on Thermal Comfort of Low-Cost Housing in Latin America. Case Study: Bogota D.C, Colombia
T2  - SMART AND HEALTHY WITHIN THE TWO-DEGREE LIMIT (PLEA 2018), VOL 1
CP  - 34th International Conference on Passive and Low Energy Architecture (PLEA) - Smart and Healthy Within the Two-Degree Limit
AB  - Construction of low-cost housing in Colombia is one of the greatest social challenges of the country. Due to Bogota's climate conditions at 8500 ft. of altitude and non-adapted materials to local conditions, the temperature of these state-subsidized dwellings is usually below optimum comfort standards. This research analyses the impact on temperatures using certain types of materials, comparing the effect of some traditional building skins-composed by brick and concrete - with a new wall envelope made of recycled elements. A comparative study was carried out by housing typologies, based on a work of measurement of the temperatures inside 16 individual dwellings.
   Thermal simulations were made to compare the traditional brick envelope material vs a compacted plastic brick, and the results suggest that the construction of dwellings with traditional materials such as brick blocks and prefabricated concrete blocks may not provide the best conditions of thermal comfort. However, alternative materials made of recycled plastic can represent a cheaper, ecological and comfortable solution. Findings could be of interest for construction stakeholders for low-cost housing programs in resilient cities, within the framework of a new plastics economy.

TI  - Sustainability ratings in residential development: a worthwhile endeavour?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION
AB  - Purpose Rating tools for the built environment were designed to engage consumers and enhance sustainability and resilience. However, the intended outcomes of these rating systems appear to have limited implementation in the residential new housing market in Australia. The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumers' motivations and experiences who have purchased houses that are situated in a sustainability-based certified development and will have been required to comply with mandatory dwelling certification.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper explores the awareness and perception of sustainability ratings and whether the motivations for purchasing in the sustainably certified development have heightened their awareness of sustainability and the resilience of new housing. This has been investigated through a pilot study of consumers who have purchased land in a certified estate and built a new home, through an online survey.
   Findings The findings reveal that the rating systems are at present not having the desired influence as first thought; that is, to inform consumers of the sustainability of a dwelling or property and to instigate trust of the environmental credentials of the property.
   Research limitations/implications This illuminating case study of participants who have purchased a sustainable rated development demonstrates that regardless of their concern for environmental issues, consumers have both low awareness and trust in the ratings. Despite this, consumers do seek value from these credentials to the overall property.
   Originality/value This study aims to illustrate the disconnect in engagement between developers, builders and new home buyers in relation to sustainability certification and implementation.

TI  - The Implications of Durability, Resilience and Energy Efficiency on the Advancement of Water Management in Wall Assemblies
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING MATERIALS
AB  - As building, energy, and green codes become more stringent, new building technologies and innovations are being incorporated into the building envelope. When incorporating new technologies into building assemblies, traditional construction practices need to be adapted. However, as these adaptations of construction practices take place, they still need to maintain adherence to basic principles of water management to prevent moisture accumulation in building assemblies. A critical component of water management is water-resistive barriers. Water-resistive barriers are used in light-frame wall assemblies behind the cladding to control the ingress of water, which penetrates the cladding, and keep it from penetrating further into the wall. Traditional water-resistive barriers were asphalt-impregnated papers and felts, which were applied in shingle fashion over the wall studs or sheathing. Plastic building wraps have to a large extent replaced the traditional building papers, comprising 75 % of the U.S. housing market. Recently, new materials being used as water-resistive barriers include panel materials and fluid-applied coatings. Assessing the durability of water-resistive barriers has been complicated by this range of material types. Because of the shingle-fashion installation, durability assessment of traditional materials and building wraps has focused on the material durability. The new materials require additional durability assessments relating to compatibility and durability of adhesion, most importantly at panel and substrate joints. This article describes the framework for evaluating water-resistive barrier durability.

TI  - Valuation of energy efficient certificates in buildings
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Building energy efficiency labeling programs are promising strategies to encourage investments in green buildings. It is necessary to explicitly measure the value of energy efficient labels from an economic perspective that is more understandable to both developers and buyers. This research not only documents evidence on whether a sales premium exists for energy-certified homes but also investigates the effects Of market characteristics on the magnitude of the added value of building energy efficiency labeling programs. A hedonic pricing model of 1679 single-family home sales in the metropolitan Atlanta area in the U.S. is developed, with numerous explanatory variables (such as location, time of sale, green features, and other housing characteristics) taken into account. Results indicate that: (i) Homes that earn energy certificates demonstrate a sales price premium of 11.7%, which equates to a dollar value of over $47,000 in Atlanta's housing market; (ii) The regional energy labels certificated by the EarthCraft House receives higher recognition in the marketplace than that by national Energy Star programs. (iii) The certified homes that are located in the top school districts (i.e., with the top 50 schools) enjoy a substantially higher increase in the home sales premium, compared to green homes in districts with the low-quality schools. A random sampling method is further used to ensure the quality of the regression results with the limited size of the dataset by eliminating stochastic effects of the selected dataset. This research contributes to (i) the body of knowledge by analyzing the market value of building energy efficiency labels in the residential housing market and (ii) the state of practice by shedding light on the information asymmetry problem between home developers and buyers in the housing market to facilitate the adoption of energy labels in building products.

TI  - Psychological and structural facilitators and barriers to energy upgrades of the privately owned building stock
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - This article studies the psychological and structural determinants, barriers and drivers of the decision to upgrade the energy standard of privately owned residential buildings. The importance of 23 potential barriers and drivers for different subgroups is analyzed, and a model is developed and tested on a sample of 2687 Norwegian house owners. The intention to include energy efficiency upgrades in a rehabilitation project is determined by feelings of moral obligation to act, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The model shows also how these variables are linked to distal psychological variables like innovativeness, perceived consumer effectiveness, social norms, problem awareness, and value orientations. The impacts of structural barriers are channeled through the psychological variables. Important barriers are a feeling that the right time has not come yet to start the rehabilitation project, and being unsure about the economic saving potential. Important drivers are better living conditions in the dwelling and higher expected comfort, reduced energy costs and an increased market value of the dwelling, and perceiving the current building standard as a waste of energy. Limited economic resources seem to make people more interested in energy efficiency upgrades. Implications for policy making are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy performance certificates - Informing the informed or the indifferent?
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are intended to provide tenants and buyers with reliable information about the energy performance of buildings. As improved energy performance may increase building sale prices and rents, the EPCs are supposed to generate incentives for owners to invest in energy efficiency. The empirical evidence for a price premium associated with energy labels is, however, inconclusive and partly contradictory. By utilizing data from the Norwegian housing market, we reproduce the positive price premium effect found in earlier studies. However, when we check these results by taking advantage of the fact that the introduction of a mandatory energy certification system represents a quasi-natural experiment, we find no evidence of a price premium. On the contrary, we present evidence that there is no effect of the energy label itself.

TI  - Application of adaptive comfort behaviors in Chilean social housing standards under the influence of climate change
T2  - BUILDING SIMULATION
AB  - Currently, energy performance indicators for buildings are associated with the primary energy source consumption, CO2 emissions or net energy distribution, which together set the building's energy efficiency. The evaluation is frequently based on setpoint temperatures and hours of operation. However, these fixed parameters are not suitable for social housing simulation as their performance tends to be in free running, excluding extremely cold or warm conditions. Therefore, a more successful assessment for the efficiency of these buildings is the users' capability to live within adaptive comfort ranges without air conditioning systems. The aim of this research is to analyze new Chilean standards for sustainable social housing in the context of climate change using the adaptive comfort approach addressed in EN 15251:2007. Using EnergyPlus simulation software, 16 parametric series are analyzed for current conditions and validated against on-site measurements. Meanwhile, a prediction for the climate in 2050 has also been taken into account. The case study is the most widespread low cost dwelling model. The study demonstrates that the period of time within thermal comfort conditions varies substantially if analysis is done using the adaptive comfort standard or the Sustainable Construction Code (CCS) for Chilean housing. Considering climate change, the percentage of time fluctuates from -19.00% to 24.30%. Concluding that the adaptive comfort model has a greater capacity to positively assess indoor temperatures for social housing in Central-Southern Chile. This research also establishes that it is possible to provide homes where standards are improved within comfort conditions without using artificial means, 99.67% of the time currently and 88.89% in the future.

TI  - A New Era of Pollution Progress in Urban China?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Over the last 30 years, China's economy has boomed. This trend has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty but it has also sharply increased local, regional, and global pollution levels. We look at the rise in air pollution over recent decades, and the perhaps surprising finding that in many of China's urban areas, levels of particulates (of less than 10 microns) have been decreasing during the last 10 to 15 years. We then turn to the costs and tradeoffs of air pollution, including costs to human health, reductions in worker productivity, and how people are seeking to reduce their exposure to pollution as shown by compensating differentials in real estate prices and purchases of masks and air filters. We discuss how rising incomes tend to raise the demand for environmental amenities and thus increase political pressure for environmental protection, and then we turn to the policy tools that China has used to reduce pollution. We conclude by arguing that as China's government is preparing for an additional 300 million people to move to urban areas over the next 30 years, it will have a number of opportunities for China to reduce pollution through a shift from manufacturing to services, along with various steps to improve energy efficiency and resource conservation. Overall, it seems that China is on track to improve its environmental performance in the years ahead.

TI  - System Dynamics Modeling of Households' Electricity Consumption and Cost-Income Ratio: a Case Study of Latvia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Increased energy efficiency of the building sector is high on the list of priorities for energy policy since better energy efficiency would help to reduce impact on climate change and increase security of energy supply. One aim of the present study was to find a relative effect of growth of demand for energy services due to changes in income, energy consumption per unit of demand due to technological development, changes in electricity price and household income on household electricity consumption in Latvia. The method applied included system dynamics modeling and data from a household survey regarding the relationship between electricity saving activities and the electricity cost-income ratio. The results revealed that, in direct contrast to the expected, a potential reduction of the electricity consumption is rather insensitive to electricity price and electricity cost-income ratio, and that the efficiency of technologies could be the main drivers for future electricity savings. The results suggest that support to advancement of technologies and faster replacement of inefficient ones rather than influencing the energy price could be effective energy policy measures. The model, developed in the study could be used in similar assessments in other countries.

TI  - Energy efficiency in US residential rental housing: Adoption rates and impact on rent
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - For 118 million residential housing units in the U.S., there is currently a gap between the potential energy savings that can be achieved through the use of existing energy efficiency technologies, and the actual level of energy savings realized, particularly for the 37% of housing units that are considered residential rental properties. Additional quantifiable benefits are needed beyond energy savings to help further motivate residential property owners to invest in energy efficiency upgrades. This research focuses on assessing the adoption of energy efficient upgrades in U.S. residential housing and the impact on rental prices. Ten U.S. cities are chosen for analysis; these cities vary in size across multiple climate zones, and represent a diverse set of housing market conditions. Data was collected for over 159,000 rental property listings, their characteristics, and their energy efficiency measures listed in rental housing postings across each city. Following an extensive data quality control process, over thirty different types energy efficient features were identified. The level of adoption was determined for each city, ranging from 5.3% to 21.6%. Efficient lighting and appliances were among the most common, with many features doubling as energy efficient and other desirable aesthetic or comfort improvements. Then using propensity score matching and conditional mean comparison methods, the relative impact on rent charged in each city was calculated, which ranged from a 6% to 14.1% increase in rent for properties with energy efficient features, demonstrating a positive economic impact of these features, particularly for property owners. This was further subdivided into five types of energy efficiency upgrade and three housing types. Single family homes generally demanded higher premiums with energy efficient features, however there was not a consistent pattern across the types of efficient upgrades. The results of this work demonstrate that investment in energy efficient technologies has quantifiable benefits for rental property owners in the U.S. beyond just energy savings. This methodology and results can also be used in other cities and by property owners, utility companies, or others, ultimately encouraging further investment and positive economic impact in residential energy efficiency and in turn improving energy and resource conservation in the building sector.

TI  - The market value of energy efficiency in buildings and the mode of tenure
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
AB  - Concerns about global warming and growing scarcity of fossil fuels require substantial changes in energy consumption patterns and energy systems, as targeted by many countries around the world. One key element to achieve such transformation is to increase energy efficiency of the housing stock. In this context, it is frequently argued that private investments are too low in the light of the potential energy cost savings. However, heterogeneous incentives to invest in energy efficiency, especially for owner-occupants and landlords, may serve as one explanation. This is particularly important for countries with a large rental sector, like Germany. Nevertheless, previous literature largely focuses on the payoffs owner-occupants receive, leaving out the rental market. This paper addresses this gap by comparing the capitalisation of energy efficiency in selling prices and rents, for both types of residences. For this purpose data from the Berlin housing market are analysed using hedonic regressions. The estimations reveal that energy efficiency is well capitalised in apartment prices and rents. The comparison of implicit prices and the net present value of energy cost savings/rents reveals that investors anticipate future energy and house price movements reasonably. However, in the rental segment, the value of future energy cost savings exceeds tenants' implicit willingness to pay by a factor of 2.5. This can either be interpreted as a result of market power of tenants, uncertainty in the rental relationship or the landlord-tenant dilemma'.

TI  - The price premium for green-labelled housing: Evidence from China
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
AB  - The Chinese central government introduced the Chinese Green Building Label' in 2008, which makes China one of the few developing countries with an official rating system of buildings' performance in sustainability. This paper investigates the existence and magnitude of the price premium associated with this official green label in the residential sector. Based on a unique data set of green-labelled, newly built housing projects and their non-labelled counterparts from around the country in 2013, an empirical analysis suggests that the labelled housing projects attract a price premium of 6.9% compared with their non-labelled counterparts. Further analysis suggests that this official green label is more effective as a reliable signal of buildings' energy efficiency in the Chinese context compared with developers' self-advertised greenness'. These results provide preliminary evidence that with this official rating system, the investment in buildings' energy-efficiency could be potentially profitable for housing developers in China, and such profitability may herald a rapid development of the green housing market in urban China.

TI  - The spatial distribution of green buildings in China: Regional imbalance, economic fundamentals, and policy incentives
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Since China released its 3-Star green building rating system in 2006, the number of certified green buildings in the country has increased sharply. The concentrations of green buildings, however, are not spread evenly across different provinces. Employing the comprehensive green building data as of February 2014, this paper attempts to analyze the spatial distribution of green buildings in China and examine its underlying determinants. The empirical results confirm that a regional imbalance does exist with regard to green building numbers. The paper also finds that local economic fundamentals and subsidy-based incentive policies can explain the presence of green buildings, but the performance of real estate market, energy efficiency, and two specific green policies (local green standard and green building committee) are not significantly associated with green building concentrations at the provincial level. Based on the empirical results, the paper also yields a number of implications, which suggest that the government can promoting more green buildings via the alleviation of economic inequality across different regions, the establishment of a market-oriented mechanism, and the improvement of public awareness regarding sustainability. These implications will help to guide the government in its efforts to establish and implement more efficient and effective green policies. From a spatial perspective, this study unveils a general picture regarding green building development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of energy efficiency in social housing. Case study: Northwest Mexico
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - This article proposes a methodology, via a case study, to address the principles of Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA), applied to energy efficiency in social housing. In Northwest Mexico (NWM), comfort in Summer cannot be achieved without mechanical cooling; the hot-dry climate, combined with poorly designed dwellings, results in large cooling loads. Having demonstrated in a previous research work that passive cooling can be effective for reducing internal temperatures, it was necessary to investigate whether strategies proposed were affordable for householders and still profitable for developers. A typical social dwelling was set as reference case to assess the remedial measures applied, resulting in two new forms of new build and one for retrofit; the analysis included the two types of mechanical cooling commonly used in NWM, the vapour compression-based air conditioning and evaporative cooling. Using the Net Present Value (NPV) as comparison parameter, results showed that investing in low-energy design or energy-efficiency upgrade is always profitable in terms of reduced energy consumption, but the payback period varies depending on the type and source of financing. For example, when using single room air-conditioning devices in a new dwelling, the additional cost of the passive features was paid for, via reduced energy bills, in six years.

TI  - Income risk in energy efficient office buildings
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - This article examines the impact of improving energy efficiency of office buildings on their financial risk. While multiple studies report a sustainability premium little is known about the corresponding risk. This research reviews the financial benefits in the context of their impact on risk. After a theoretical analysis of the topic, it forms two hypotheses which are supported with empirical tests performed on a large panel dataset of US commercial office buildings. Changes in the magnitude of the green premium in rent and changes in rental volatility are used as indicators of financial risk associated with energy certification. The study concludes that acquiring an EnergyStar certificate is related to a structural change in statistical characteristics of rents which may be related to the level of energy efficiency. The average effect is positive but varies over time.

TI  - Estimating the Value of Price Risk Reduction in Energy Efficiency Investments in Buildings
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - This paper presents a method for calculating the value of price risk reduction to a consumer that can be achieved with investments in energy efficiency. The value of price risk reduction is discussed to some length in general terms in the literature reviewed but, so far, no methodology for calculating the value has been presented. Here we suggest such a method. The problem of valuating price risk reduction is approached using a variation of the Black-Scholes model by considering a hypothetical financial instrument that a consumer would purchase to insure herself against unexpected price hikes. This hypothetical instrument is then compared with an actual energy efficiency investment that reaches the same level of price risk reduction. To demonstrate the usability of the method, case examples are calculated for typical single-family houses in Finland. The results show that the price risk entailed in household energy consumption can be reduced by a meaningful amount with energy efficiency investments, and that the monetary value of this reduction can be calculated. It is argued that this often-overlooked benefit of energy efficiency investments merits more consideration in future studies.

TI  - Steel SIPs for Residential Building Construction: Lessons from Air Leakage and Thermography Analysis of Australian Houses
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Stick-frame residential construction is renowned for being leaky. Structural insulated panels (SIPs) theoretically resolve the issues with air and thermal leakage, but such construction systems are new to the Australian housing market. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which a steel-skinned SIP construction product could resolve air leakage and thermal performance challenges in five climate zones across Australia in 2015. All houses used the same steel SIPs as the main construction element (walls and roof). Airtightness and thermography tests were conducted in each house in winter to identify air and thermal leakage paths. The results show that even first-time users of this product can produce well-sealed homes, but there is a need to address thermal bridging (because of the steel componentry) and to consider the house as a whole system (not just walls and roof). The results of the study raise questions about thermography test procedures and airtightness regulations for naturally ventilated homes in warm-temperature climates. Addressing these issues will assist in the diffusion of innovative construction products and methods to enhance the energy efficiency of housing.

TI  - Residential energy efficiency and distributed generation - Natural partners or competition?
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Residential energy efficiency and distributed generation seem to be natural partners in our journey towards a more sustainable energy future. A growing range of energy efficient consumer technologies and extraordinary declines in photovoltaics system prices has seen household electricity demand fall whilst a growing proportion of the remaining load is provided by household self-generation. Australia is a particularly interesting example of these developments, with around 15% of households now possessing a PV system while per-capita household demand has also fallen markedly. However, existing retail electricity tariffs and regulatory arrangements can create mixed incentives for households contemplating both PV and energy efficiency options and for their network service providers. This is certainly the case in Australia with net metering arrangements that value self consumption of PV far more than PV exports to the grid. There are also complex benefits for the electricity network created by these household energy resources that can be significant. In this paper we use real household load and PV data from Sydney households to model the potential implications of existing electricity tariff arrangements on the financial attractiveness of PV and energy efficiency. We model these options separately and in combination for both households implementing these options and their network service providers. Our results highlight how inappropriate tariffs may well adversely impact on the value that the combination of energy efficiency and PV offers not only to households, but also to their network service providers, and suggest ways that such impacts might be ameliorated by acknowledging the benefits that these resources can offer to the electricity network.

TI  - SETTLEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL HEATING COSTS IN MULTIFAMILY BUILDINGS - POLISH EXPERIENCE
T2  - ARCHITECTURE CIVIL ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT
AB  - European Directive on energy efficiency requires the settlement of energy consumers according to the actual consumption. The use of properly operating and socially acceptable settlement systems of individual heating costs contributes to energy savings in the residential sector. The paper presents the national legal requirements in this field and the possibility of using different settlement systems of heating costs. The main causes of irregularities in settlements of individual heating costs using heat cost allocators in housing sector in Poland are listed and described. There are presented proposals of existing irregularities elimination, in order to obtain adequate quality of the heating cost division in building into individual apartments.

TI  - Economic impact of changing thermal regulation-An application to the city of Lisbon
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Over the last years there have been frequent changes to buildings' thermal legislation, to cope with increasing environmental restrictions and a wider consumer awareness. This work has a twofold objective: 1 provide an overall methodology to evaluate changes in buildings' thermal regulations; 2 to assess the economic merit of these regulatory changes, which have a profound economic impact especially on homeowners, tenants and the global urban real estate market, but also on the society through wider environmental impacts. The literature has provided several contributions at the scale of buildings, but few at the scale of cities (or even regions). This paper uses the city of Lisbon (Portugal) as a case study to test the methodology and determine the economic impact of the changes made in the thermal legislation by the Government. The economic assessment was made at 3 levels: financial analysis, economic analysis and social-economic analysis. It was found that the new regulation brings not only environmental benefits but also economic benefits in long term at both individual and social level. It was furthermore concluded that the impact of those benefits are geographically uneven, and old areas of the city with worse energy ratings have better economic indicators. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Beyond average energy consumption in the French residential housing market: A household classification approach
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - In a new environment marked by the growing importance of Green House Gas emissions, fuel poverty, and energy efficiency in the different national agendas, the comprehension of energy demand factors appears to be crucial for the effectiveness of energy policies. We consider the latter could be improved by targeting specific household groups rather than looking to follow a single energy consumption level target. This article explores the scope of having a disaggregated energy consumption market to design policies aimed at curbing residential energy consumption or lowering its carbon intensity. Using a clustering method based on the CHAID (Chi Square Automatic Interaction Detection) methodology, we find that the different levels of energy consumption in the French residential sector are related to socio-economic, dwelling and regional characteristics. Then, we build a typology of energy-consuming households where targeted groups (fuel poor, high income and high consuming households) are clearly and separately identified through a simple and transparent set of characteristics. This classification represents an efficient tool for energy efficiency programs and energy poverty policies, but also for potential investors, which could provide specific and tailor made financial tools for the different consumer groups. Furthermore, our approach helps designing some energy efficiency score that could reduce the rebound effect uncertainty for each identified household group.

TI  - Energy Efficiency Premiums in Unlabeled Office Buildings
T2  - ENERGY JOURNAL
AB  - Whether commercial real estate market participants effectively evaluate building energy efficiency characteristics in the absence of a green label has so far remained unaddressed in the literature. I estimate the energy efficiency premium in unlabeled office buildings by exploiting variation in mandatory building energy standard implementations as a result of the 1992 U.S. Energy Policy Act. A more stringent energy code leads to rent and price premiums of approximately 4 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Heterogeneity in the rent premium is also observed based on who pays the utility bills, as would be expected if market participants correctly evaluate energy conservation characteristics. The rent and price premiums are consistent with full capitalization of the energy savings from a more stringent standard.

TI  - Analysis of building energy consumption through panel data: The role played by the economic drivers
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Policy makers have realized that without significant increases in the energy efficiency and notable reductions in the energy use of the household sector, it will be impossible to lower carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate the risks of climate change at the global level. The energy demand in residential buildings is influenced by several parameters, such as national economic growth, climate and weather, demographic structure, and technological development. In this paper, we analyze the determinants of electricity and natural gas consumptions in Italy during the period from 2004 to 2013. We provide estimates of price and income elasticities of the demand for both the energy sources in the residential sector. The role played by both energy price and household income is worth attention because it provides evidence for the occurrence of the direct rebound effect. Therefore, the economic drivers of the energy demand are important to improve the policies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contrast the global warming. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Does the Energy Label (EL) Matter in the Residential Market? A Stated Preference Analysis in Barcelona
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Energy performance in buildings has become a milestone in EU environmental policy in the last 15 years. Nonetheless, in some countries such as Spain the full acceptance of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is still relatively rare and novel, with little evidence as to how relevant it is in the real estate market. There are different reasons for this phenomenon: on the one hand, the real estate crisis has paralyzed the completion of most of the works in new/refurbished efficient buildings (which renders it impossible to use revealed preference methods); on the other hand, information is not complete and the consumer's perception of the relevant cost/benefits could be incorrect. For this reason, assessing the trade- off between the energy label and other specific attributes of the housing market has become important. To that end, a choice experiment following an RPL (Random Parameter Logit) model was employed. This form is suitable to accommodate various empirical situations where the assumptions of the Conditional Logit model have to be relaxed. Results suggest that the Energy Label (EL) does matter in the real estate market in relation to other residential attributes. Marginal willingness to pay for an "A" label instead of an "E" is significantly higher than the stated savings in energy costs. The respondents' utility function seems to be also influenced by their educational level, as well as by their preference to own a house as opposed to renting it.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY ASPECTS OF CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND GREEN BUILDINGS
T2  - LATVIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND TECHNICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Green building is an important component of sustainable real estate market development, and one of the reasons is that the construction industry consumes a high amount of resources. Energy consumption of construction industry results in greenhouse gas emissions, so green buildings, energy systems, building technologies and other aspects play an important role in sustainable development of real estate market, construction and environmental development. The aim of the research is to analyse environmental aspects of sustainable real estate market development, focusing on importance of green buildings at the industry level and related energy aspects. Literature review, historical, statistical data analysis and logical access methods have been used in the research. The conducted research resulted in high environmental rationale and importance of environment-friendly buildings, and there are many green building benefits during the building life cycle. Future research direction is environmental information process and its models.

TI  - Building energy efficiency: A research branch made of paradoxes
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - The literature dealing with building energy efficiency has long since debated about the possible occurrence of the so-called Jevons' paradox. In a nutshell, benefiting from energy savings due to transition to high-performance buildings, may the same savings cause a kind of rebound effect, by acting as an incentive to increase consumptions? On closer inspection, this is not the only paradox affecting the research branch that focuses on the energy used by the buildings and the building industry. A second paradox is that investments in energy efficient solutions may contribute to energy price control, which in turn lends itself to make the same investments not profitable. A third paradox lies in the need to adopt energy-intensive materials in order to achieve substantial energy savings in operation; hence, sometimes, we just substitute a certain amount of operating energy with a more or less commensurate amount of embodied energy. Here we argue that the joint consideration of the paradoxes mentioned above should not be neglected since it brings with itself several implications needing to be disentangled, whether we aim to get further enhancements in this disciplinary field.

TI  - Buildings Energy Performance in a Market Comparison Approach
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - The current regulations on the energy certification of buildings represent for the real estate market and the building sector a real cultural revolution. In recent years, the focus on the energy efficiency of buildings has grown exponentially. It is therefore necessary that the property valuations and methodologies used for this purpose bear in mind the energy quality of buildings. This study aims to determine the contribution of an energy performance feature to the real estate property value. This information can help, on the one hand, to understand the energy savings and the corresponding savings income in the property management and, on the other, to control the air pollution from CO2 emission reduction. The energy performance hedonic price and the CO2 emission price are appraised in the Market Comparison Approach (MCA).

TI  - Experimental Analysis of a Heat Cost Allocation Method for Apartment Buildings
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - The correct estimate of individual thermal energy consumptions, and consequently, a fair heat cost allocation among the residents of apartment buildings with centralized heating systems, represents an important driving force towards energy saving, energy efficiency and the reduction of pollutant emissions. Nowadays, in those contexts where direct heat meters cannot be used because of the layout of the hot water distribution system, electronic Heat Cost Allocators (HCAs) have the highest market share for the assessment of individual thermal energy consumptions. The uncertainty associated with the parameterization of heat cost allocation devices and the installation effects arising in real applications can negatively affect the accuracy of these devices, as far as the estimation of the individual fractions of thermal energy consumption is concerned. This work deals with the experimental analysis of a novel heat cost allocation method for apartment buildings and its comparison with conventional HCAs. The method allows the indirect estimation of the thermal energy exchanged by water radiators without the need for surface temperature measurements, reducing some of the drawbacks associated with the on-site installation. The experimental analysis was carried out in a full-scale central heating system test facility available at the Italian National Metrology Institute (INRIM) and characterized by SI-traceable direct heat meters installed on each water radiator.

TI  - Is energy efficiency capitalized into home prices? Evidence from three US cities
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - We test for evidence that energy efficiency features are capitalized into home prices in three U.S. metropolitan areas. Using hedonic regressions and multiple matching procedures, we find that Energy Star certification is associated with higher sales prices in two of the markets: the Research Triangle region of North Carolina and Portland, Oregon. We find that local "green" certifications in Portland and in Austin, Texas, are also associated with higher prices and that the estimated price impacts are larger than those from Energy Star. Matching on observables proves to be important in some cases, reducing the estimated impacts compared with models without matching. We calculate the implied energy savings from the estimated premiums and find that, in the Research Triangle market, the Energy Star premiums approximately equal the savings that program is designed to achieve, but in Portland, the premiums are slightly greater than the program's savings due to low energy costs in the region.

TI  - Rising residential energy consumption and GHG emissions in Malaysia: A case study of public low-cost housing projects in Kuala Lumpur
T2  - INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Malaysia's electricity consumption is increasing exponentially as it gears towards becoming a developed nation by year 2020. This paper is aimed at policy development in terms of energy efficiency and building design as Malaysia has yet to establish any mandatory energy efficiency or energy performance building code. The focus on public low-cost housing projects is important as it is administered by government agencies and provides possible streamlining of proposed energy policies for the housing sector. Presented in this paper are findings from fieldwork conducted to investigate the energy performance and green house gas (GHG) emissions from the building operation of two public low-cost housing projects in Kuala Lumpur. The baseline calculations use UNEP-SBCI's Common Carbon Metric tool to provide project-specific calculations of energy and emissions intensity with its bottom-up approach, while presenting a national-scale projection using its top-down approach. Findings from bottom-up analysis suggest that Malaysian public low-cost housing households consume more than benchmarks set by the World Energy Council and the International Energy Agency, in terms of Building Energy Index (BEI) of kwh/m(2)/year. This is a reflection of the absence of building energy efficiency legislation in Malaysia, both for residential and non-residential buildings. The importance of this research lies in its focus on a developing country experiencing rapid urbanisation and climate change effects.

T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB  - This paper contributes to the growing literature on the economics of green buildings: by merging auction theory and hedonic regression analysis we investigate the relationship between market concentration and price premiums in the American market for eco-certified real estate assets. Auction theory is used to model price formation where eco-investors may differ in their valuation of assets. Controlling for a large number of features, the empirical results provide evidence of a significant and positive relationship between investors' eco-certified market share and prices of eco-certified space. Contributing to the recent debate over the nature of the green premium, we find that eco-investors are creating clientele effects and that they may be subject to a green winner's curse.

TI  - Design optimization of sustainable affordable housing model in hot-arid climate-case of Jordan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper is to study and evaluate the situation of different affordable housing projects with an eye toward developing a new affordable and sustainable housing model in the hot-arid climate of Jordan. There is a clear interest in providing affordable housing, yet sustainable and environmental issues are highly marginalized. To bridge this gap, and to meet Jordanian housing needs while tackling environmental problems, this research has analyzed the environmental issues of selected housing projects in Jordan, aiming to determine the existing problems. In addition, it proposes a solution through a sustainable and affordable housing model that was analyzed and compared to the previously studied housing projects.
   Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional design strategy was adopted and a mixed design method was used. Information related to the physical and operation characteristics of buildings was collected through the review of "as built" drawings and other relevant documents. Further information was obtained from field surveys and personal interviews with architects and decision-makers in the housing sector. Energy consumption patterns of these housing projects were analyzed using the DesignBuilder simulation program. Water efficiency was assessed using the BRE Code Water Calculator. Based on the previous analysis, a new housing model was developed that was evaluated in terms of energy and water consumption.
   Findings - The analysis shows a significant difference among different housing projects in terms of energy cooling and heating loads in different climatic regions in Jordan. Energy analysis proved that the proposed model is energy efficient in different locations and it can save up to 50.4 per cent of annual energy usage in comparison with existing projects. In addition, it can save around 43 per cent of water consumption by using a number of modifications for saving water.
   Originality/value - Most of the housing initiatives focus on providing affordable housing, yet sustainable and environmental issues are highly marginalized. This research will bridge the gap by reducing the operation cost of affordable housing through adapting and implementing sustainable measures of design and construction.

AB  - This work explores the role of the buildings energy performance in defining the real estate market value, taking in consideration the presence of spatial autocorrelation. At this regard, it is necessary to put in evidence that a great heterogeneity exists on the Italian territory with reference to buildings energy performance; for this reason, being able to identify a class of most performing estimation models, suitable to separate the spatial effects from the influence of the building components
   -including the energy rating-on the value, seems to be an interesting goal. In particular, this work illustrates an experiment based on the Spatial Auto Regressive (SAR) model implemented on a sample of residential units located in the city of Turin and represents a first step of a more wide research program.

TI  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF STEEL BUILDINGS
T2  - EKONOMIA I SRODOWISKO-ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the environmental credentials of steel buildings and to present the environmental impact categories and values in a steel housing activity through a case study of steel office building. In this framework, a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was applied, which provides an understanding of the overall environmental performance of a housing construction. The relative influence of the service lives of different building components compared to the energy use of the buildings with a different energy efficiency is presented. As the analysis showed, recycling of construction waste becomes a critical issue, which can ensure a number of environmental benefits. The aim of this research activity was also to point out the need for an integrated approach in the design process, combining environmental performance assessment with structural calculations. Environmental impact assessment of the construction activity was carried out, following the inventory listing, in order to reach to useful conclusions on the environmental study of the project. Although steel and concrete proved to be responsible for the negative environmental impacts the ability of reuse and recyclability of steel has decreased the negative impacts of steel construction on environmental burdens.

TI  - A multi-criteria framework for decision process in retrofit optioneering through interactive data flow
T2  - INTERNATIONAL HIGH-PERFORMANCE BUILT ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE - A SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE 2016 SERIES (SBE16), IHBE 2016
CP  - International High-Performance Built Environment Conference (iHBE)
AB  - Aim of this research is to deliver a system of procedures and instruments that allows comparing different scenarios of restoration and retrofit of existing buildings applicable each time a relevant decision about the asset has to be made. The system developed takes advantages of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), thus to focus on main clients' needs. Decisions about real estate assets are frequently made by managers with incomplete and scattered data, not sufficient to fully support the decision making process. Using a BIM model as a central repository of information could strongly support to compare objectively different scenarios and consequently to decide the application of a multi-criteria matrix involving management, energy, economic and social issues. BIM and BEM (Building Energy Modelling) techniques have a wide potential and analysis capabilities; however, they are often adopted without an integrated framework, causing missing performances and costs overrun. The result is a system enabling to analyze the asset, to produce BIM and BEM models ready to include life cycle data, to evaluate feasible alternatives and scenarios and to extract relevant performance indicators for decision makers' support. An existing office building in Milan representing an awkward field for intervention is the case study for the system application. While the tools and software adopted are commonly used, the system of procedures developed by the authors can be considered as an ensemble of workflows otherwise typically used independently. Using them together enhance the decision process providing data on which to set up a strategic plan of the refurbishment considering costs, continuity in occupancy and energy efficiency.

TI  - Is energy performance too taxing? A CAMA approach to modelling residential energy in housing in Northern Ireland
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - Buildings contribute significantly to CO2 production. They are also subject to considerable taxation based on value. Analysis shows that while similar attributes contribute to both value and CO2 production, there is only a loose relationship between the two. If we wish to use taxation to affect policy change ( drive energy efficiency behaviour), we are unlikely to achieve this using only the current tax base (value), or by increasing the tax take off this current tax base (unlike extra taxation of cigarettes to discourage smoking, for example). Taxation of buildings on the basis of energy efficiency is hampered by the lack of current evidence of performance. This paper aims to model the now-obligatory (at sale or letting) energy performance certificate (EPC) data to derive an acceptable appraisal model (marked to market, being the EPC scores) and deploys this to the entire population of properties. This provides an alternative tax base with which to model the effects of a tax base switch to energy efficiency and to understand the tax incidence effects of such a policy.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a multiplicative hedonic approach to model energy efficiency utilising EPC holding properties in a UK jurisdiction [Northern Ireland (NI)] as the sample. This model is then used to estimate discrete energy assessments for each property in the wider population, using attributes held in the domestic rating (property tax) database for NI (700,000+ properties). This produces a robust estimate of the EPC for every property in its current condition and its cost-effective improved condition. This energy assessment based tax base is further used to estimate a new millage rate and property tax bill (green property tax) which is compared against the existing property tax based on value to allow tax incidence changes to be analysed.
   Findings - The findings show that such a policy would significantly redistribute the tax burden and would have a variety of expected and some unexpected effects. The results indicate that while assessing the energy performance of houses can be a complex process involving many parameters, much of the explanatory power can be achieved via a relatively small number of input variables, often already held by property tax jurisdictions. This offers the opportunity for useful housing stock modelling - such as the savings possible from power switching. The research also identifies that whilst urban areas display the expected "heat island" effect in terms of energy consumption, urban properties are on average more efficient than suburban/rural properties. This facilitates spatial targeting of policy messages and initiatives.
   Research limitations/implications - Analogous with other studies, data deficiencies introduce the risk of omitted variable bias. Modelling of the energy efficiency in the sample is limited to property attributes that are available for the wider population of properties. While this limits the modelling exercise, it is a perennial issue facing mass appraisal worldwide (where knowledge of the transacted sample attributes generally exceeds knowledge of the unsold properties). That said, the research demonstrates the benefits of sharing data and improving knowledge of the housing stock, as taxation databases would be stronger, augmented with EPC-derived property attributes for example.
   Originality/value - The EPC lead in time for wide residential coverage is likely to be considerable. The paper contributes to emerging literature and policy debate surrounding the effect, performance measurement and implementation of energy efficiency certification, through a greater understanding of the sectorial and geographical dispersion of energy efficiency. It provides high level research to help guide policy and decision-making, identifying key locales where there is more of a physical problem and locations where there is more to gain in terms of targeting energy improvement and/or encouraging behavioural change. The paper also allows a glimpse of the implications of a change towards a taxation regime based on energy efficiency, which contributes to the debate surrounding the "greening" of property based taxes.

TI  - Energy performance certificates in the Turin real estate market
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) on the Italian real estate market, focusing on old buildings. The contribution of EPC labels to house prices and to market liquidity was measured to analyze different aspects of the selling process.
   Design/methodology/approach - A traditional hedonic model was used to explain the variables of listing price, transaction price, time on the market and bargaining outcome. In addition to EPC labels, the building construction period and the main features of apartments were included in the model. A sample of 879 transactions of old properties in Turin in 2011-2014 was considered.
   Findings - A first hedonic model let us suppose that low EPC labels (E, F and G) were priced in the market although EPC labels explained only 6-8 per cent of price variation. A second full hedonic model, which included apartment characteristics, revealed that EPC labels had no impact on prices.
   Originality/value - In Italy EPC has been mandatory for house transactions since 2009, so there are few studies on the effect of EPC on the Italian real estate market at least to our knowledge. Furthermore, unusually for the Italian context, in this paper also transaction prices were analyzed, in addition to the more frequently used listing prices.

TI  - Corporate real estate, stock market valuation and the reputational effects of eco-certification
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY RESEARCH
AB  - Improving the energy efficiency of retail stores has become an important strategy for retailers. However, why do some retailers obtain Energy Star certification for their stores while others do not? We argue that retailers pursue this certification to capture reputational benefits of the Energy Star label when their stock market valuation is low. Using longitudinal data for US retailers (grocery and department stores) over the period of 2002 to 2014, we find that stock market valuation measured by Tobin's Q explains (1) the likelihood of a retailer obtaining Energy Star certification and (2) the share of Energy Star-certified stores in a retailer's portfolio. Operating expenses on the other hand do not appear to drive the decision to obtain Energy Star certification. Our results also suggest that the motivations of retailers to obtain LEED and Energy Star certification differ.

TI  - The NatHERS dataset: An exploration of its content, provenance, and usefulness in the characterization of new residential building
T2  - IMPROVING RESIDENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, IREE 2017
CP  - International Conference on Improving Residential Energy Efficiency (IREE)
AB  - New residential buildings in Australia must demonstrate compliance with the energy efficiency provisions of the National Construction Code (NCC) in order to gain a building permit. 71% of new residential buildings demonstrate compliance by using a Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) accredited software tool. The data collected and generated by these tools have the potential to provide valuable insights into Australia's residential building industry, giving advance knowledge of not only the number of planned builds and their energy efficiency, but also planned construction material types and quantities. The data would be of value to government departments, construction companies, the real estate industry, energy distributors, and researchers. This paper describes the content and provenance of this dataset, explores how it might be used to characterise new residential building stock, and presents sample data and analysis.

TI  - Preliminary study of the condition of social housing in the city of Durango, Mexico
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY IN ENERGY AND BUILDINGS 2017
CP  - 9th International Conference on Sustainability and Energy in Buildings (SEB)
AB  - Buildings in general, housing and specifically social housing in Mexico, have high demand of energy as a consequence of the use of heating and cooling systems; mainly due poor design and the use of thermally inefficient construction materials. An analysis of the thermal behavior and energy consumption was demanded by the local housing development chamber. One of the first steps towards the accomplishment of this objective is to complete a diagnostic of the condition of social housing in the city of Durango in Mexico. Diagnostic not only including thermal comfort and thermal behavior of the dwelling, but a complete diagnostic consisting on: location, urbanization history and a climatic analysis. The study was focused towards housing intended for low income families, which are candidate to be financed by federal housing organizations, meaning that there is an important limitation on budget. It is thought that the final cost of such dwellings limit the quality of design and materials. This housing has to comply with NOM-020-ENER-2011 (Mexican norm of energy efficiency in buildings: residential dwellings) and the calculation of energy demand through the DEEVi tool (Calculation of energy efficient dwellings). This requirements need to be fulfilled so they can become candidates to be financed by the federal housing organizations. There are several previous studies analyzing the thermal behavior of social housing in Mexico that have been focused on hot or warm regions of the country, where the air conditioning needs are predominant. However, the weather of the city of Durango is ranked as BS in the Koppen classification, where the minimum and maximum ambient temperatures require the use of cooling and heating systems. The results shown in this preliminary study include: the identification and delimitation of the historic growth of the urban sprawl from 1775 to 2010 and a preliminary evaluation of the impact of passive strategies. The comfort hours provided by the passive strategies were calculated and design guidelines were enunciated. The considered parameters were: housing location, local weather conditions and the characteristics of the social housing construction (material and building systems). (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Heat Supply Systems of Renovated Residential Buildings
T2  - 6TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE RESEARCH FOR ENVIRONMENT AND CIVIL ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT (CIVIL ENGINEERING 17), VOL 6
CP  - 6th International Scientific Conference on Research for Environment and Civil Engineering Development (CIVIL ENGINEERING)
AB  - Since 2010 in Latvia energy efficiency improvement measures in residential buildings have been actively implemented with an aim to reduce heat energy consumption and heating costs in houses. The aim of the study is to find optimal solutions for reducing energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency indicators of heating and domestic hot water systems. In the framework of the study heat consumption analysis of the domestic hot water supply systems in residential buildings was carried out. The results showed that heat energy savings and home energy efficiency theoretically and optimistically predicted by the renovation project after three years of operation of renovated houses were not reached. It was concluded after a thorough analysis that the external enclosing construction insulation reached predicted energy savings. Energy efficiency of the heat supply system was low, thermal energy consumption was higher than expected. Central heating systems are hydraulically unstable because heat in apartments is regulated emotionally, exceeding the regulated operating mode. The domestic hot water supply systems low energy efficiency causes relatively large thermal energy losses in hot water distribution and in circulation pipelines. The project was implemented in 2014; after three heating seasons of operation data monitoring, fixation of project deficiency and correction of solutions were carried out. According to the operation data monitoring, this innovative system is the most functional and energy efficient, corresponding to installed requirements of the project. After the assembly was completed the system was tuned to work in calculation mode and put into operation. During operation while heat consumption regime is changing, the functional efficiency does not change. Apartment heating system heat output is automatically regulated according to the room temperature. Preparation of hot water is provided in every apartment's boiler capacity (in local space heaters) with the combined heating system heat transmission at 70 degrees C temperature. It provides hot water heating to 60 degrees C close to the final user and prevents the growth of microorganisms in hot water distribution system pipelines of the end user.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE CONFERENCE SPBWOSCE-2016 - SMART CITY
CP  - International Science Conference SPbWOSCE - SMART City
AB  - Building and developing an affordable housing market is a huge challenge for Russia's national economy. Today, the housing construction industry finds itself in a situation torn by a conflict caused by the simultaneous needs to minimize the housing construction costs in order to make housing more affordable for Russians and to increase the energy efficiency of the housing projects, which is associated with additional costs for developers. To find solutions to this contradictory situation, one needs new theoretical and practical approaches and economic tools. The global economic trend of managing goods and services on the basis of the value of goods and services over the life cycle is also manifested in the construction industry in Russia. The problem of forming a new economic thinking in the housing sector predetermines the perception of the value of housing not only as the price of purchased real estate, but as the equivalent of the total cost of ownership of real estate throughout its life cycle. This approach allows to compensate the initial rise in the cost of construction resulting from the introduction of energy-efficient technologies by savings in the operational phase of the life cycle of the property. In this regard, management of the total cost of real estate ownership based on energy modeling is of high research and practical relevance.

TI  - Smart Cities - A Panacea for the Ills of Urbanization: An Indian Perspective
T2  - BREAKTHROUGHS IN SMART CITY IMPLEMENTATION
AB  - Cities across the globe occupy 3% of the earth's land surface, house half of the human population, use 75% of the resources and account for 2/ 3rd of all energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. Reliable estimates have pegged the urban population of the world by 2050 at 70%. To deal with the problems of urbanization such as population explosion, high level of pollution, traffic chaos, huge scarcity of houses, inadequate water supply, heaps of garbage, poor infrastructure, security concerns, unemployment, overpowering political set up, etc. the concept of inclusive Smart cities, evolved in the European Union and has now spread across the continents. Thus a new approach to take on the colossal challenges of this century has emerged.
   It is expected that the Smart Cities will address public issues, employing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based solutions, on the basis of municipality driven multi-stakeholder partnership. The need to strengthen or extend citizens' participation in initiatives by Municipalities and emphasize establishment of more refined and accessible governance structure has been realized. While the concept of Smart Cities is still under development and evolution, it has caught on across the globe and has spearheaded a new approach to look at urban development and management. Cities have their own requirements and peculiar limitations necessitating public centric strategies, appropriate and economically viable technology and funding mechanisms.
   Cities accommodate nearly 31% of India's current population and contribute 63% of GDP. Urban areas are expected to house 40% of India's population and contribute 75% of India's GDP by 2030. Indian Government would earmarkUSD1054 million to fund the development of a hundred Smart Cities with a view to address various problems arising out of an accentuated rate of population influx. The Mission will have duration of five years (FY2015-16 to FY2019-20). The city level Pre-takeoff Plans in respect of quite a few cities are stimulating investment by engaging identified stakeholders i. e. ICT businesses, real estate developers, infrastructure providers, retail business and transport operators to support Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects and actions. The objective of Indian Smart City initiatives is to increase the resilience of the city. It is proposed to develop the 100 Smart Cities as Satellite Towns of larger cities by modernizing existing mid-sized cities. The aim is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of ` Smart' Solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model which will act like a light house to other aspiring cities.
   The new initiative of the Government of India to make cities capable of facing the 21st century challenges with the generous reliance on the latest frontiers of technologies available, serious efforts towards capacity building of the personnel manning the projects and above all employing methods to make them financially sustainable with little aid will go a long way in creating a Resurgent Urban India. The importance of deploying advanced technologies for solving the problems of city governance with ease cannot be undermined. But at the same time while embracing newer and smarter technologies to offer ease of doing business, care should be taken to make available services to the lowest denominator of the society too, in a way he/she is comfortable with.

AB  - Problems of environmental friendliness and energy efficiency in recent decades have become not only the most important issues of economic development of the main industrial economies, but also the basis for the processes of maintaining the security and relative stability of the global ecosystem. The article presents the results of the study of the status and trends of the development of environmental standards for the construction and maintenance of real estate in the world and particularly in Russia. Special market instruments for assessing the compliance with the quality of real estate projects under construction and modern principles of environmental friendliness and energy efficiency include voluntary building certification systems that are actively used in international practice. In Russia there is active use of the following international systems of certification: BREEAM, LEED, DGNB, HQE. Also in the Russian certification market, the national standard STO NOSTROY 2.35.4-2011 "Residential and public buildings" is being implemented, which summarizes the best international experience of the rating evaluation procedure. Comparative characteristics of the "green" standards and the principles of rating assessments of the ecological compatibility of buildings give an idea of applying these standards in Russia.

AB  - A large portion of the human population now lives in cities and by 2050 even a larger fraction of people will be urban dwellers. Many metropolitan areas have seen tremendous real estate development in recent years, yet the roads, water mains, sewers, and power grids have seen no, or extremely limited, upgrades. Whatever infrastructure is in place is aging and, unfortunately, may experience temporary use rationing as upgrades are made, as often one reads in the local press and/or experiences personally. It is clear that technological solutions are needed to manage the increasingly-scarce infrastructure resources under the limitations imposed by population growth, limited financial resources, and, in many instances, local political inertia. The Internet of Things (IoT) offers the promise of improving the resource management of many assets related to city life - including the flow of goods, people, and vehicles, and the greening of the environment - by optimizing energy consumption and maximizing life-activity efficiency. This review article assesses some of the application issues, the technical requirements, and some of the technical solutions, including the use of High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and Mobile IPv6 Protocols (MIPv6), associated with a broad-based deployment of IoT capabilities in urban settings; these IoT-based solutions enables city administrations to approach a desired state where citizens can reliably enjoy the Quality of Life benefits afforded by a Smart City paradigm.

CP  - AiCARR 50th International Congress
AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are expected to be a useful instrument for stakeholders (including final users), enabling to compare building energy performances within a purchasing/renting decision process. Thereby, EPCs should have a direct impact on the value of the properties, affecting the market attractiveness, as well as driving the investors in the energy renovations process. Nevertheless, a survey to real estate agents reveals a perceived low reliability of EPCs, representing one of the main barriers in their full implementation.

AB  - The article discusses the role of energetics in creating a comfortable and safe environment of modern megacities, and the problem is considered in the socio-economic aspect. The object is the energy security of the city, and the subject is the influence of urban society on the formation of energy security. In particular, the problems are raised: ecological problems of urban energy supply, the condition of surface layer of the atmosphere near electric power lines. The author assesses the actions, implemented by the urban authorities in Mytischi, in the southwestern areas of New Moscow. The author assesses these sample areas on the basis of Ch. Landry's concept of self-training, designated for municipal authorities and urban communities, and offers several successfully implemented self-study cases and in the light of modern methods of ensuring energy security. The forecasts of creation of energy-safe space, made by modern sociologist-urbanist Leo Hollis, are taken into account. The author also considers some of the economic aspects of biosphere safety. In particular, he insists that biosphere safety, convenience, and comfort have developed into competitive advantages in the housing market.

AB  - Internet of Things has gained a lot of hype in a very short period and is being adopted by varied sectors in order to attain its potential by bringing advanced level of automation in the respective industry based activities to reap the benefits. The commercial real estate is one such domain that many countries are focusing on transforming their buildings and infrastructure to have the cities contributing towards to become as 'smarter cities'. The intelligent buildings are where the schools, offices, residential complexes integrate IoT for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of the building infrastructure. The fundamental drivers that have encouraged for smart buildings in the market place are meeting the goals of corporate social responsibility, revenue growth and improving operational efficiency. With the demand for deployment of smart buildings on the rise, there have been many key trends that have emerged making it a thrust to have revolutionized transformation for digitalizing the commercial buildings, homes, etc. by means of effective smart solutions. The paper critically analyses the role of IoT in smart buildings, the latest trends that are demanding for a shift to smart buildings, and highlights the challenges for smart buildings implementation.

TI  - Do green buildings capture higher market valuations and lower vacancy rates? A Canadian case study of LEED and BOMA-BEST properties
T2  - SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Purpose - It is becoming increasingly clear that as the pressures of climate change increase around the world, all nations must strive to lower their carbon footprint through conservation. If the growth trend of green building and infrastructure construction is to be continued and improved upon, then evidence must be collected as to the benefits they bring about, and the level of support they enjoy in the market. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the economic performance of green buildings by evaluating whether LEED for Homes and BOMA-BEST properties capture higher market valuations and lower vacancy rates. These types of research questions have not been investigated to a great deal in the Canadian context. The primary analysis concerning municipal market valuation of green buildings was conducted using robust ordinary least squares and logistic regression models. Commercial vacancy rates were compared through the use of chi(2) tests. Our analysis did not lead to conclusive evidence that there exists a "green" premium in the real estate market with respect to municipal market valuations. The authors argue that this may largely be due to municipal appraisal methods that currently do not incorporate sustainability factors. As such, they may not adequately reflect market tastes and trends. Furthermore, while the vacancy rates of green commercial buildings were, on the whole, lower than their non-green counterparts, the differences were not statistically significant. Given these results, the authors propose a set of research activities that the academic community should pursue.
   Design/methodology/approach - Statistical techniques are utilized test whether green certification (LEED/BOMA-BEST) leads to higher municipal valuation for both commercial and residential green properties, using regression analysis. Furthermore,chi(2) tests are conducted to evaluate whether certification leads to lower vacancy rates for commercial properties.
   Findings - In terms of valuation, certification does not exert (on average) a positive role in terms of higher valuations for both commercial and residential properties. However, with respect to vacancy rates, there is a tendency towards lower vacancy rates for green properties, but the relationship is not statistically significant.
   Research limitations/implications - The next set of research needs to gather greater amount of data with respect to how municipal evaluations are performed since the results are counter-intuitive. Greater tracking of the financial performance of green buildings should be conducted and made available for both public and private bodies. Particularly, rental and sale prices of green buildings need to be tracked in an organized manner.
   Practical implications - The valuation techniques utilized by the municipal authorities need revision as green properties are being assessed without appropriate guidance from educational institutions. Furthermore, the limited amount of "green" valuation techniques in existence may not be applied.
   Originality/value - This is the first Canadian-based research looking into the valuation of green certification using rigorous quantitative statistical techniques and original and publicly available data. Furthermore, it holds important lessons for municipal authorities with respect to green building valuation beyond Canada as the limitations of current practice go mostly likely beyond the North American context.

TI  - Energy consumption in an ageing population: exploring energy use and behaviour of low-income older Australians
T2  - IMPROVING RESIDENTIAL ENERGY EFFICIENCY INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, IREE 2017
CP  - International Conference on Improving Residential Energy Efficiency (IREE)
AB  - This paper explores energy use and behaviour of older urban Australians by identifying the key factors that shape their energy demand. As Australia is facing an aging population, understanding what structural and behavioural factors can help improve residential energy efficiency is key for developing effective policy initiatives to support the successful management of household energy costs, wellbeing and carbon emissions within this population. This paper reports on survey and electricity meter data collected for an energy efficiency program involving 1,647 older householders (aged 60 and above) living within the Brisbane City Council Local Government Area. The program was funded by the Australian Government Low-Income Energy Efficiency Program (LIEEP) and ran from November 2013 to February 2015. Brisbane is Australia's third largest city and has a subtropical climate, with warm or hot weather for most of the year. The findings show that electricity consumption within the study's sample population was influenced by both structural and demographic factors. These factors include range of energy sources used, number of bedrooms and number of people living in the household, as well as type of appliances used in the home. In terms of appliance use, high-energy consuming appliances such as water heating and space cooling systems, clothes-dryers and refrigerators were important predictors of energy consumption. Over two-thirds of the study participants were relying on cooling systems for thermal comfort, and such systems were typically not being used in an energy efficient way. The use of high-energy demand heating and cooling systems can account for around 40% of energy consumption in Australian households, and has a large impact on electricity peak demand. With the penetration of air-conditioning in seniors' home expected to increase over time, it is important to better understand the range of low and high-energy demand practices that are currently employed by older Australians to achieve thermal comfort at home. Designing strategies that minimise the need for high-energy demand cooling practices will be key for managing household energy costs and wellbeing within this target audience. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - New strategies towards nearly zero energy in existing buildings: the ABRACADABRA project
T2  - BEYOND NZEB BUILDINGS
CP  - AiCARR 50th International Congress
AB  - ABRACADABRA is an European Project funded by the Horizon 2020 Program, based on the assumption that substantial increase in the real estate value of the existing buildings can play a key role in the deep renovation. The project aims at demonstrating to the key stakeholders and fmancial investors the attractiveness of a new renovation strategy based on volumetric Add-ons and Renewable energy sources (AdoRES) intended as one (or a set of) Assistant Building unit(s) like aside or facade additions, rooftop extensions or even an entire new building construction that "adopt" the existing buildings (the Assisted Buildings) to achieve nearly zero energy. The creation of these AdoRES aims at reducing the initial investment allocated for the deep renovation of the existing building creating an up-grading synergy between old and new. The ABRA strategy can thus result in the implementation of a punctual densification policy that aims at fostering the investments in deep renovation of the existing built environment, driving process innovation in the construction and the real estate sector. The paper, after outlining the main aspect of the project, focuses on a case study in Italian context, where different technological solutions and related economic impact are analysed: from a deep renovation to AdoRES strategies and different scenarios of renovation. The preliminary feasibility study and cost assessment, show the benefit given by the presented strategy in overcoming actual financial e tecnical barriers. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Impact of energy performance on transaction prices Evidence from the apartment market in Bucharest
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to estimate the green premium effect of retrofitted apartments in Bucharest and draw comparisons with international examples.
   Design/methodology/approach - A geo-referenced transaction database including information on whether the property had been retrofitted is utilised. The paper uses two approaches to test the green premium. One is a hedonic model controlled by areas to estimate the price incentive of a green building. The second is a STAR GLS model evaluating the diffusion effect of house prices spatially by sub-market and assessment upon the pricing effect of green characteristics.
   Findings -The authors' findings suggest a green premium in two Bucharest areas of between 2.2 per cent and 6.5 per cent. Spatial diffusion effects are shown to contribute positively to house prices, but the unobserved spatial component reduces this effect.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first to assess price impacts of green characteristics in Bucharest and one of the first analysing green premium using spatial techniques. The analysis is of significance to policymakers and real estate developers.

TI  - Benchmarking Framework to Encourage Energy Efficiency Investments in South Europe. The Trust EPC South Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABLE SYNERGIES FROM BUILDINGS TO THE URBAN SCALE
CP  - International Conference on Sustainable Synergies from Buildings to the Urban Scale (SBE)
AB  - The Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) market is still embryonic in South Europe since there are still many barriers: difficult access to financing, limited investors' confidence in EPC models, scarcity of flagship projects, lack of certification schemes and financing mechanisms, especially for the tertiary sector (hospitality, tourism, healthcare), which presents a huge potential for Energy Efficiency (EE). The Trust EPC South project, funded by Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, aims to scale up investments in EE solutions in the private tertiary sector in South Europe, by delivering a robust investment standardization and benchmarking framework and a pipeline of bankable EPC projects in 6 countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia and Greece); its results will eventually be extended to the Balkan. Tailored capacity building activities will allow an easier access to third-party financing, thus unlocking the large tertiary sector EE and Renewable Energy market potential.
   Initially, national market analyses took place (EPC providers, beneficiaries-clients, and financial institutions) to identify the market potential. National Discussion Platforms were set up to develop the national roadmaps addressing mechanisms for mitigation of policy, legal, and especially financial barriers. An investment standardization and benchmarking framework, built upon an established real estate assessment tool (Green Rating T), is actually setting up in order to build trust amongst all parts of the EPC value chain. The methodology will be upgraded including a financial assessment model. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND EXHIBITION ON PACKAGING AND INTEGRATION OF ELECTRONIC AND PHOTONIC MICROSYSTEMS, 2017
CP  - ASME International Technical Conference and Exhibition on Packaging and Integration of Electronic and Photonic Microsystems
AB  - Data centers concern not just energy usage, but also other important overall considerations such as the actual computational work, the energy efficiency and the performance of servers. The server, as one of the key ingredients of a data center, plays an increasingly crucial role in contributing to the overall energy use, especially in cases where the efficiency of the infrastructure has been optimized. Baidu has been exploring the sweet zone between power and performance in efficient rack server design and deployment for their self-built data center energy efficiency optimization from all the aspects. Recent deployment of rack server with distributed backup battery (Li-ion) subsystem (BBS) is one typical example to demonstrate their advanced rack server design for energy efficiency. Compared with lead acid battery based traditional UPS in data center, distributed BBS design in Baidu rack server has an advantage in lower power loss, data center power delivery and topology simplification, data center real estate saving, scalable deployment on demand without overprovision and so on, which overall contributes to a total cost ownership (TCO) reduction on both cap-ex (i.e., power infrastructure investment) and op-ex (i.e., electricity bill).
   This paper introduces overall architecture and design of Baidu rack server with distributed BBS. Furthermore details energy efficiency design methodology of power peak draw trimming based on workload power characterization; Also the related lab data collection, experiments result, ongoing work and future plan are summarized in the end. This paper also recaps TCO saving points benefiting from distributed BBS design into rack server system.

TI  - A Smart Energy Platform for the Internet of Things - Motivation, Challenges, and Solution Proposal
T2  - BUSINESS INFORMATION SYSTEMS (BIS 2017)
CP  - 20th International Conference on Business Information Systems (BIS)
AB  - The increasing number of smart appliances equipped with sensors, actuators and tags connected to the Internet and their ability to communicate with one another forms the basis for an Internet of Things (IoT). The data recorded by smart appliances can be utilized to detect energy savings potential and to increase energy efficiency in households. Despite these possibilities, value-added services which successfully incentivize customers to save energy are missing or are still immature. In this paper, we propose a solution for a smart energy platform that aims at reducing this gap by providing the infrastructure and tools which enable the integration of smart appliances and the development of value-added services for an automated energy management in households. In this context, we give an overview of the main challenges for IoT platforms in general and show that existing solutions currently do not fully meet them.

TI  - On the quality and impact of residential energy performance certificates
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - This paper addresses quality and impact issues concerning Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) by means of a dataset based upon the Swedish EPCs for single-family houses. Assuming that the quality of the certificates plays an important role for their impact, we examine to what extent various characteristics of the firms and experts issuing the certificates are influencing their assessments of energy consumption and energy conservation. Exploiting the information on biased assessments, we also investigate the relationship between the transaction price of a house and its EPC label. Doing so, we distinguish the attributes that can be observed by visiting the house and those that a buyer only can inform herself about through the EPC.
   Applying regression analyses we find that firm and expert characteristics matter quite a lot implying that the EPC-quality could be improved considerably by increasing the inter-rater reliability. The results also show that the price impact of the energy label is related to information that the buyers can obtain by visiting the house rather than to information uniquely provided by the EPCs. Hence, the EPCs per se are unlikely to stimulate energy conservation through the price mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy efficiency labeling program for buildings in Brazil compared to the United States' and Portugal's
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Regulations are being promulgated and reviewed in order to achieve the maximum energy savings in buildings, both in developed and in developing countries. One important strategy employed to turn these laws and regulations effective is through building certification. The benefit of such practice may reflect in energy savings, reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, to end-users and real estate owners. The objective of this study is to make a literature review concerning energy efficiency policies and regulations for buildings, highlighting how the Brazilian labeling program can be improved compared to the United States and Portugal programs. It is important to point out that the Brazilian program is under consolidation in comparison with the Portuguese and American ones. Furthermore, the assessment shows that: (i) although it is an initiative in the interest of society and it is meant to several types of buildings, the Brazilian labeling program does not inform suggestions for the building improvements; (ii) it is not mandatory; (iii) it does not value net-zero energy building; (iv) it does not inform the CO2 emissions savings; and (vi) it is not sufficiently stringent to challenge the building industry to improve the efficiency levels.

TI  - The inhabited environment, infrastructure development and advanced urbanization in China's Yangtze River Delta Region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This paper analyzes the relationship among the inhabited environment, infrastructure development and environmental impacts in China's heavily urbanized Yangtze River Delta region. Using primary human environment data for the period 2006-2014, we examine factors affecting the inhabited environment and infrastructure development: urban population, GDP, built-up area, energy consumption, waste emission, transportation, real estate and urban greenery. Then we empirically investigate the impact of advanced urbanization with consideration of cities' differences. Results from this study show that the growth rate of the inhabited environment and infrastructure development is strongly influenced by regional development structure, functional orientations, traffic network and urban size and form. The effect of advanced urbanization is more significant in large and mid-size cities than huge and mega cities. Energy consumption, waste emission and real estate in large and midsize cities developed at an unprecedented rate with the rapid increase of economy. However, urban development of huge and mega cities gradually tended to be saturated. The transition development in these cities improved the inhabited environment and ecological protection instead of the urban construction simply. To maintain a sustainable advanced urbanization process, policy implications included urban sprawl control polices, ecological development mechanisms and reforming the economic structure for huge and mega cities, and construct major cross-regional infrastructure, enhance the carrying capacity and improvement of energy efficiency and structure for large and midsize cities.

TI  - Energy efficiency measures implemented in the Dutch non-profit housing sector
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The existing housing stock plays a major role in meeting the energy efficiency targets set in EU member states such as the Netherlands. The non-profit housing sector in this country dominates the housing market as it represents 31% of the total housing stock. The focus of this paper is to examine the energy efficiency measures that are currently applied in this sector and their effects on the energy performance. The information necessary for the research is drawn from a monitoring system that contains data about the physical state and the energy performance of more than 1.5 million dwellings in the sector. The method followed is based on the statistical modeling and data analysis of physical properties regarding energy efficiency, general dwellings' characteristics and energy performance of 757,614 households. The outcomes of this research provide insight in the energy efficiency measures applied to the existing residential stock. Most of the changes regard the heating and domestic hot water (DHW) systems, and the glazing. The rest of the building envelope elements are not improved at the same frequency. The results show that the goals for this sector will be hard to achieve if the same strategy for renovation is followed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Residential home heating: The potential for air source heat pump technologies as an alternative to solid and liquid fuels
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - International commitments on greenhouse gases, renewables and air quality warrant consideration of alternative residential heating technologies. The residential sector in Ireland accounts for approximately 25% of primary energy demand with roughly half of primary home heating fuelled by oil and 11% by solid fuels. Displacing oil and solid fuel usage with air source heat pump (ASHP) technology could offer household cost savings, reductions in emissions, and reduced health impacts. An economic analysis estimates that 60% of homes using oil, have the potential to deliver savings in the region of 600 per annum when considering both running and annualised capital costs. Scenario analysis estimates that a grant of 2400 could increase the potential market uptake of oil users by up to 17% points, whilst a higher oil price, similar to 2013, could further increase uptake from heating oil users by 24% points. Under a combined oil-price and grant scenario, CO2 emissions reduce by over 4 million tonnes per annum and residential PM2.5 and NOx emissions from oil and peat reduce close to zero. Corresponding health and environmental benefits are estimated in the region of 100m per annum. Sensitivity analyses are presented assessing the impact of alternate discount rates and technology performance. This research confirms the potential for ASHP technology and identifies and informs policy design considerations with regard to oil price trends, access to capital, targeting of grants, and addressing transactions costs.

TI  - Modeling the energy retrofit decision in commercial office buildings
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Retrofitting existing buildings has emerged as a primary strategy for reducing energy use and carbon emissions, both nationally and in cities. Despite the increasing awareness of retrofitting opportunities and a growing portfolio of successful case studies, little is known about the decision-making processes of building owners and asset managers with respect to energy efficiency investments. Specifically, the research presented here examines the effects of ownership type, tenant demand, and real estate market location on building energy retrofit decisions in the commercial office sector. This paper uses an original, detailed survey of asset managers of 763 office buildings in nineteen cities sampled from the CBRE, Inc. portfolio. Controlling for various building characteristics, the results demonstrate that ownership type and local market do, in fact, influence the retrofit decision. Overall, this analysis provides new evidence for the importance of understanding ownership type and the varying motivations of differing types of owners in building energy efficiency investment decisions. The findings of both the survey analysis and the predictive model demonstrate additional support for the targeting of energy efficiency incentives and outreach based on ownership entity, local market conditions, and specific physical building characteristics.

TI  - Retrofit cost-effectiveness: Estonian apartment buildings
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - The economic viability and investment cost of the energy retrofit of apartment buildings are analysed through different energy efficiency levels. To analyse retrofit policy cost-optimal energy efficiency levels and investment costs, a baseline of measured actual energy usage of apartment buildings was created and then individual energy-saving measures and retrofit packages were composed. The cost-optimal level over a 20-year period for apartment building retrofit was a low-energy-building energy performance level, with an investment cost of Euro150-170/m(2). Retrofit to low energy building level would be economically viable but the investment capability of apartment owner associations is found to be insufficient for the necessary investments to achieve low-energy-building energy performance. Therefore, it is necessary to determine what levels of financial support can encourage retrofit to occur. The analysis of the current retrofit shows that subsides will increase investment by apartment owner associations into energy efficiency improvements. The target group for energy efficiency retrofit subsidies should be apartment buildings that reach low energy building performance level or at least match the energy performance requirement for new buildings.

TI  - Introduction of Behavioral Parameterization in the EPC Calculation Method and Assessment of Five Typical Urban Houses in Wallonia, Belgium
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The Energy Performance Certification (EPC) of existing residential buildings has been designed to introduce energy efficiency as a comparative criterion for real-estate purchase choices, which should influence real-estate market value and stimulate energy saving investments. EPCs in Belgium are asset ratings, calculated with a standardized approach, which purposefully (and understandably) takes the human factor out of the equations in order to allow the comparison of buildings. As a result, they often overestimate energy consumption and present discrepancies that do not allow appropriation of the results by potential buyers. This study proposes complementary EPC results, obtained by integrating the behavior of occupants in the calculation method. This paper first analyses the pool of behavioral uncertainties that influence the results of EPCs, describes a questionnaire built to gather additional data on households' characteristics and energy consumption habits and proposes modifications to the calculation method. The complementary results are then compared to regulatory EPC results and real consumption data. Though acknowledging the necessity of a standardized EPC for dwellings' comparison, this study completes it with data on the energy consumption-related behaviors to (partially) close the gap between real and theoretical consumptions.

TI  - Doing good but not that well? A dilemma for energy conserving homeowners
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper the issue of market capitalization of energy efficient buildings is addressed by considering single-family housing in Sweden and through analyzing as to what extent the market price for a house is influenced by its energy performance. Are Swedish homeowners doing well by doing good?
   We make use of information provided by the Swedish energy performance certificates for single-family homes matched with data on the corresponding transaction prices, household characteristics and attributes of the neighborhood. The resulting database, covering about 77,000 individual observations, is used to analyze the relationship between the price of a house and its energy performance by means of a hedonic model. Unlike most other studies the energy performance is decomposed into energy consumption and several other variables characterizing the energy system. The main question addressed is if there is a price premium for energy efficient housing in Sweden.
   Our results differ from earlier studies and indicate no price premium related to the energy consumption but substantial premiums for housing attributes that improve the energy efficiency. A likely explanation is that prospective buyers of new homes base their expectations about future energy consumption on those attributes rather than on the energy consumption of the previous owner.

TI  - Green signalling effects in the market for energy-efficient residential buildings
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - Empirical evidence from recent studies suggests that the price premium on energy-efficient buildings is potentially higher than the pure capitalisation of energy savings but the empirical evidence on the size of the non-savings components is scant. This study aims to fill this research gap by investigating whether the mandatory energy efficiency ratings for residential properties imply benefits that go beyond energy savings. Using a sample of several thousand apartment transactions from Helsinki, Finland, we first test if higher ratings were significantly associated with higher prices. In addition to a large number of property and neighbourhood characteristics, this dataset contains information on building-level energy usage which allows us to distinguish between the cost savings effect of energy consumption and the value of more intangible factors associated with the energy label. The hedonic model yields a statistically significant 3.3% price premium for apartments in the top three energy-efficiency categories and 1.5% when a set of detailed, neighbourhood characteristics are included. When maintenance costs containing energy usage costs are added, a robust and significant price premium of 1.3% persists whereas no differentiation is found for the medium and lower rating categories. These findings may be indicative of energy-efficient buildings having signalling value - and therefore an additional incentive to invest in such buildings - for 'green' consumers. However, a favourable energy rating did not appear to speed up the sales process in the analysed market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy efficiency and economic value in affordable housing
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Strong rental protection in the affordable housing market often prohibits landlords from charging rental premiums for energy-efficient dwellings. This may impede (re)development of energy efficient affordable housing. In the Netherlands, affordable housing institutions regularly sell dwellings from their housing stock to individual households. If they can sell energy efficient dwellings at a premium, this may stimulate investments in the environmental performance of homes.
   We analyze the value effects of energy efficiency in the affordable housing market, by using a sample of 17,835 homes sold by Dutch affordable housing institutions in the period between 2008 and 2013. We use Energy Performance Certificates to determine the value of energy efficiency in these transactions. We document that dwellings with high energy efficiency sell for 2.0-6.3% more compared to otherwise similar dwellings with low energy efficiency. This implies a premium of some EUR 3,000 to EUR 9,700 for highly energy efficient affordable housing. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Housing Market Fundamentals, Housing Quality and Energy Consumption: Evidence from Germany
T2  - ENERGY JOURNAL
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between regional housing market fundamentals and energy consumption. We argue that dwellings, in particularly rental properties, are not only consumer goods, but also constitute financial market assets. Properties are spatially fixed and traded in regional contexts, where real estate market characteristics like vacancy, income levels, and expectations determine rent and prices, which in turn provide incentives to invest in housing quality. The level of housing quality (e.g. windows, building materials, or heating technology) in turn influences the level of energy consumption. While this view is established in the real estate and urban economics literature, it has only recently found its way into the energy debate. As a result, the relationship between regional housing market fundamentals and energy consumption has received little attention. This study provides a first attempt to address this paucity. Utilizing aggregate data on regional space-heating energy consumption from over 300,000 apartment buildings in 97 German planning regions, the study applies structural equation modeling to estimate the influence of housing market fundamentals on the level housing quality, and subsequently on regional energy consumption. Findings provide first evidence that regional differences in housing market conditions have a significant impact on housing quality and energy consumption. Specifically, the results suggest that carbon abatement programs in buildings should focus on regions with weak housing market fundamentals, as market incentives are unlikely to incentivize investors to invest in housing quality attributes. The authors conclude by highlighting important implications for energy research and avenues for further investigations.

TI  - Multi-criteria assessment for the effective decision management in residential energy retrofitting
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Building sector is responsible for 40% of European energy consumption, of which heating and cooling account for around 70%. Moreover, 75% of buildings for 2050 are already built in Europe. On the road to a sustainable energy transition, this article develops a multi-criteria assessment methodology for the environmental, economic and social evaluation of different residential energy retrofit solutions, based on effectiveness indices. This methodology allows improving the decision management in residential energy retrofitting by identifying the most effective solutions according to the requirements and needs of each intervening agent (citizens, public administrations and private promoters). The methodology is based on the integrated analysis of environmental, economic and social variables. It is applied to a Mediterranean case study from Southern Spain built in 1955. As part of methodology, survey data from the different stakeholders were collected, identifying the keys that condition the viability of the measures. The results show that measures with few inconveniences to tenants, investment costs below 2000(sic)/dwelling and payback periods below 15 years are the most viable by end-users' implementation in the Mediterranean area, but between them, only efficient heat pumps allow achieving more than 45% of CO2 emissions reduction (with a payback period of 6 years).

TI  - Reducing carbon dioxide emissions in China's manufacturing industry: a dynamic vector autoregression approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Currently, global warming, frequent occurrence of extreme weather and air pollution are common problems facing the international community. Carbon dioxide emissions are the root causes of these environmental and climate issues. Due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, China has become the world's largest energy consumer and carbon dioxide emitter. Moreover, the manufacturing industry is highly energy-consuming and pollution-intensive, accounting for nearly 60% of China's total energy consumption and over 50% of total carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, identifying the main drivers of the industry's carbon dioxide emissions is vital for China's emission reduction and global efforts to enhance environmental protection. This study uses Vector Autoregressive model to analyze the influencing factors of the changes in carbon dioxide emissions in the industry. The results show that energy efficiency plays a dominant role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Urbanization also has significant effect on carbon dioxide emissions because of large-scale real estate construction and high rate of vehicle ownership. Energy structure has higher impact on emission reduction than industrialization due to massive coal consumption and industrial structure optimization. Therefore, the Chinese government should increase investment in energy-saving technology, optimize energy structure, promote the production and use of new energy and hybrid vehicles.

TI  - Evaluation of Investment to improve the Quality of Buildings and generate Positive Externalities
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - Investment in housing construction is an investment of major importance for families and, in Italy, is still the largest investment of most Italian families. In recent years, however, the housing market crisis has resulted in a reduction in trading volumes and investment in housing has been a sharp reduction in the domestic market. However, the Italian government has provided tax benefits to encourage investment in renovation with the aim of improving building quality via energy saving investments in order to promote the generation of positive externalities and to reactivate the construction sector. In this context, the work has the aim to develop and apply a discounted cash flow (DCF valuation model) to a sample of 20 civil buildings located in northern Italy which were scheduled for a building renovation intervention to improve energy efficiency. Applying the model via the calculation of internal rate of return (IRR) allows shifting the focus from cost assessments to private home building performance assessments in order to compare the investment in building renovation with other investments, including financial investment. The analysis result shows, at a duration of 10 years, that the return on investment for building renovation has no cases of negative return in the 20 cases analyzed and has an average IRR of 8.5619% and median IRR of 8.1050% higher than the bond issued by the Italian Treasury (BTP) and is particularly affected by tax benefit incentives. The IRR approach may allow a better assessment of building renovation investment, particularly to achieve a better knowledge of the effects of tax benefits on building renovation investment.

TI  - Effects of demand side management on Chinese household electricity consumption: Empirical findings from Chinese household survey
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - China's residential electricity demand has grown rapidly over the last three decades and given the expected continued growth, demand side management (DSM) can play an important role in reducing electricity demand. By using micro-level data collected from 1450 households in 27 provinces in the first ever China Residential Energy Consumption Survey in 2012, this study estimates the effects of three DSM measures empirically: tiered household electricity pricing, China Energy Label program, and information feedback mechanisms. We find these measures have contributed to moderating residential electricity demand growth but additional policy reform and tools are needed to increase their effectiveness and impact. Residential electricity demand is found to be price- and income- inelastic and tiered pricing alone may not be as effective in electricity conservation. The statistically significant relationship between China Energy Label efficient refrigerators - but not televisions - and lowered residential electricity consumption reflect mixed program effectiveness. Lastly, of the information feedback currently available through electricity bills, payment frequency and meters, only meter reader is estimated to be statistically significant. Important policy implications and recommendations for improving each of these three DSM measures to expand their impact on reducing residential electricity consumption are identified.

TI  - The price effect of building energy ratings in the Dublin residential market
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - This paper is an empirical study of the relationship between the energy performance rating of residential homes in the Dublin market between 2009 and 2014 and their market prices, controlling for building type, size, age and location. Initial results suggest that energy efficiency has a significant, positive relationship with list price. A 50-point improvement in the Energy Performance Indicator (kWh/m(2)/year) is associated with a 1.5 % higher list price. Alternatively, using the Building Energy Rating metric, a 1-point improvement in the 15-point scale from G to A1 yields a list price increase of 1 %. This mirrors findings for efficiency price premiums on a nationwide basis from Hyland et al. (2013). We also find that it is important to include controls for the age of the dwelling to avoid biased energy efficiency estimates in the hedonic model.

TI  - The price of energy efficiency in the Spanish housing market
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The housing sector is a substantial consumer of energy, and therefore a focus for energy savings efforts. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), introduced in 2002 and revised in 2010, is a key instrument to increase the energy performance of buildings across the European Union. Following the implementation, of the EPBD into Spanish law, all properties offered for sale or rented out in Spain are required to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). Given that the implementation of the EPC scheme for new, existing and advertised properties is still very low in Spain, unlike other European housing markets, the Spanish one lacks market data on energy efficiency (EE) labels and their impact on housing price. To overcome this gap, we determine the EE ratings of a sample of 1507 homes across Spain on the basis of information collected previously through household surveys. This allowed us to answer the question of whether or not, and to what extent, Spanish housing markets capitalise the value of EE. We apply the hedonic-price technique and observe that More energy efficient dwellings have a price premium between 5.4% and 9.8% compared to those with the same characteristics but lower EE level.

TI  - Market response to the public display of energy performance rating at property sales
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Energy labels have generally received positive response from consumers and have moved the market for white goods and cars in the direction of more energy-efficient products. On the real estate market, it was expected that an energy label, rating the energy performance of a property based on a national energy performance certificate (EPC) might receive similar response. However, in Denmark no response to the energy performance rating was observed for 15 years. This was a surprise considering that Denmark was the first country to implement an A to G rating of the energy performance of buildings. A statistical examination of data on property sales prices and energy performance ratings was carried out. All relevant property transaction data from 2007 till 2012 were examined and they showed that energy performance ratings had an impact on property sales prices. However, before June 2010, the impact was modest, whereas after June 2010 the impact of energy performance ratings on property sales prices increased significantly as a result of an EU requirement to display the energy performance rating in connection with property sales. On this background, it was concluded that a public display of the energy performance rating is fundamental for market response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploring transaction costs in passive house-oriented retrofitting
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - In order to tap the energy saving and climate mitigation potential of buildings, transaction costs of implementing energy efficient technologies need to be better understood and ultimately reduced. The objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the nature and scale of transaction costs resulting from the application of the passive house concept in energy efficient renovations. Related conceptual choices are also discussed. This study explores learning strategies as a potential to reduce transaction costs. It focuses on transaction costs borne by building owners and building developers in the planning and implementation phases of a passive house-oriented renovation in Sweden. Results reveal three main sources of transaction costs: due diligence, negotiations and monitoring. The analysis shows that transaction costs are non-negligible and for individual cost sources the scale can be three times higher than for conventional renovations. To reduce transaction costs, various learning strategies such as study visits, demonstration projects, new forms of meetings and new channels of (written) information were found. These strategies have the potential to half transaction costs of future renovation projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy performance certificates and 3-dimensional city models as a means to reach national targets - A case study of the city of Kiruna
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Enhanced dissemination of information regarding energy saving and climate change targeted toward property owners is considered to be an important strategy in order to reach the Swedish national target of energy efficiency in the building sector by 2050. Here the municipality energy advisors and the national register for energy performance certificates can facilitate the mitigation of energy use in the building stock. So far few studies have focused on the practical road map to the national target of energy use on the city/district level and to the communication aspects with stakeholders in the creation of energy city models.
   In this paper a city energy model is developed based on the requests and need for visualization from a group of energy advisors. Six different scenarios are studied in order to analyze the possibility of reaching the energy targets specified by the government in the town of Kiruna. The results show that: (1) it is possible to automatically create city energy models using extract, transform and load tools based on spatial and non-spatial data from national registers and databases; (2) city energy models improve the understanding of energy use in buildings and can therefore be a valuable tool for energy advisors, real estate companies and urban planners. The case study of Kiruna showed that the proposed energy saving measures in the energy performance certificates need to be implemented and new buildings in the urban transformation must be of high energy standard in order to reach the national target in Kiruna.

TI  - Improving the economics of building energy code change: A review of the inputs and assumptions of economic models
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Building energy code change in Australia, and many other developed nations, is subject to standardised economic tests, with a net present value calculation at the heart of the economic analysis. Although many nations have introduced minimum energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial buildings, increases in stringency have been hindered by limitations to the range of private and societal impacts typically incorporated in regulatory impact assessments. Given the policy move towards net zero energy homes, a more comprehensive set of inputs and robust assumptions are needed to support further regulatory change. Yet the literature provides substantial evidence of many private and societal costs and benefits not commonly incorporated into the economic assessments that underpin regulatory change. Drawing on a case study of Australian and UK residential regulatory change assessments, this paper highlights limitations to the range of inputs and assumptions currently incorporated within the economic arguments applied during residential energy code change processes, and presents a more comprehensive economic argument that could support further stringency improvements.

AB  - For more than a decade, governments have been incentivizing, and now requiring, private developers to construct energy efficient, sustainable projects. We examine the effectiveness of green single-family construction incentive programs. A cross-sectional comparison of municipalities with and without green private residential incentive programs indicates which government levels of policy issuance and which types of certification programs prove most successful, and when those impacts should be expected. Findings indicate that only municipalities experience success with construction-related policies, which may be tailored to their local market's construction demands. Business-related policies, however, prove effective at all levels of government implementation, with particular success at the state level. Lastly, event studies and multiyear window data indicates that green incentive policies elicit the greatest change 2 to 3 years after their implementation.

TI  - Energy performance ratings and house prices in Wales: An empirical study
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings on residential prices in Wales. Drawing on a sample of approximately 192,000 transactions, the capitalisation of energy efficiency ratings into house prices is investigated using two approaches. The first adopts a cross-sectional framework to investigate the effect of EPC rating on price. The second approach applies a repeat-sales methodology to investigate the impact of EPC rating on house price appreciation. Statistically significant positive price premiums are estimated for dwellings in EPC bands A/B (12.8%) and C (3.5%) compared to houses in band D. For dwellings in band E (-3.6%) and F (-6.5%) there are statistically significant discounts. Such effects may not be the result of energy performance alone. In addition to energy cost differences, the price effect may be due to additional benefits of energy efficient features. An analysis of the private rental segment reveals that, in contrast to the general market, low-EPC rated dwellings were not traded at a significant discount. This suggests different implicit prices of potential energy savings for landlords and owner-occupiers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multifamily energy-efficiency retrofit programs: a Florida case study
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - Multifamily buildings are an important target for efficiency improvements because of their energy savings potential and housing market share. Yet few multifamily retrofit projects have been completed in hot-humid regions and even fewer studies have measured and verified savings from such projects. Addressing this gap, the purpose of our research is to assess the impacts of energy-efficiency upgrades to multifamily buildings in Orlando, FL. Specifically, we measure the first-year electricity savings from retrofits to 232 units in four apartment complexes. Annual savings per unit averaged 2094 kWh (22 %) and ranged from 1700 kWh (18 %) to 3811 kWh (29 %) across complexes. Monthly savings ranged from 48 kWh (9.4 %) in December to 340 kWh (31 %) in August. From these core findings, we estimate that tenants in treatment units saved an average of $272 on their electric bills. We also find evidence to support a strategy of targeting upgrades to improve overall savings and program cost-effectiveness. Results are being used to guide development of a utility demand-side management program for multifamily property owners. Progress in this market requires additional pilot projects, access to utility data, reliable measurement and verification of savings, and innovative financing structures.

TI  - A dynamic analysis of air pollution emissions in China: Evidence from nonparametric additive regression models
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - PM2.5 emissions not only have serious adverse health effects, but also impede transportation activities, especially in air and highway transport. As a result, PM2.5 emissions have become a public policy concern in China in recent years. Currently, the vast majority of existing researches on PM2.5 are based on natural science perspective. Very few economic studies on the subject have been conducted with linear models. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2001 to 2012, and uses the STIRPAT model and nonparametric additive regression models to examine the key driving forces of PM2.5 emissions in China. The results show that the nonlinear effect of economic growth on PM2.5 emissions is consistent with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The nonlinear impact of urbanization exhibits an inverted "U-shaped" pattern due to the rapid development of urban real estate in the early stages and the strengthening of environmental protection measures in the latter stage. Coal consumption follows an inverted "U-shaped" relationship with PM2.5 emissions owing to massive coal consumption at the beginning and efforts to optimize the energy structure as well as technological progress in clean energy in the latter stages. The nonlinear inverted "U-shaped" impact of private vehicles may be due to the different roles of scale, structural and technical effects at different stages. However, energy efficiency improvement follows a positive "U-shaped" pattern in relation to PM2.5 emissions because of differences in the scale of the economy and the speed of technological progress at different times. As a result, the differential dynamic effects of the driving forces of PM2.5 emissions at different times should be taken into consideration when initiating policies to reduce PM2.5 emissions in China.

TI  - Integrated decision-making about housing, energy and wellbeing: a qualitative system dynamics model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: The UK government has an ambitious goal to reduce carbon emissions from the housing stock through energy efficiency improvements. This single policy goal is a strong driver for change in the housing system, but comes with positive and negative "unintended consequences" across a broad range of outcomes for health, equity and environmental sustainability. The resulting policies are also already experiencing under-performance through a failure to consider housing as a complex system. This research aimed to move from considering disparate objectives of housing policies in isolation to mapping the links between environmental, economic, social and health outcomes as a complex system. We aimed to support a broad range of housing policy stakeholders to improve their understanding of housing as a complex system through a collaborative learning process.
   Methods: We used participatory system dynamics modelling to develop a qualitative causal theory linking housing, energy and wellbeing. Qualitative interviews were followed by two interactive workshops to develop the model, involving representatives from national and local government, housing industries, non-government organisations, communities and academia.
   Results: More than 50 stakeholders from 37 organisations participated. The process resulted in a shared understanding of wellbeing as it relates to housing; an agreed set of criteria against which to assess to future policy options; and a comprehensive set of causal loop diagrams describing the housing, energy and wellbeing system. The causal loop diagrams cover seven interconnected themes: community connection and quality of neighbourhoods; energy efficiency and climate change; fuel poverty and indoor temperature; household crowding; housing affordability; land ownership, value and development patterns; and ventilation and indoor air pollution.
   Conclusions: The collaborative learning process and the model have been useful for shifting the thinking of a wide range of housing stakeholders towards a more integrated approach to housing. The qualitative model has begun to improve the assessment of future policy options across a broad range of outcomes. Future work is needed to validate the model and increase its utility through computer simulation incorporating best quality data and evidence. Combining system dynamics modelling with other methods for weighing up policy options, as well as methods to support shifts in the conceptual frameworks underpinning policy, will be necessary to achieve shared housing goals across physical, mental, environmental, economic and social wellbeing.

AB  - The objective of this article is to develop and apply a specific discounting cash flow (DCF) approach to evaluate investment in renovation to improve building quality, thus increasing energy efficiency. In this article, we develop and apply a specific net present value (NPV) and an internal rate of return (IRR) approach to quantify the value created for the owners of the building by the investment in renovation via energy-saving investments that produce positive externalities. The model has an applied interest because, in recent years, a lot of investments in real estate were made by owners in order to increase the green quality of the buildings, and several funds of public aid were provided by the government to stimulate these energy-saving investments. The model proposed here is applied to a case study of a 16-apartment building located in northern Italy considers the model attempts to quantify the initial investment value, the energy savings, the tax deduction of the initial investment and the terminal value of the investment as the increase in building value. The analysis shows that the model is consistent in evaluating investments to improve building quality, and investments within the context of the specific case study considered in the research have IRRs ranging from a minimum of 4.907% to a maximum of 12.980%. It could even be useful to consider a sample of cases to verify whether our results are representative of this specific case study. The model could represent a useful tool for consumers in evaluating their own investments in building renovation, from a stand-alone perspective and even by comparing them with other types of investment. The research could be developed in the future to quantify the social welfare generated by public spending via tax deductions to reduce the costs of investment in energy savings for buildings and could even be applied to new real estate projects in comparing different construction technologies and even comparing the return of renovation investment with other investments not even in the real estate sector.

TI  - Does the housing market value energy efficient homes? Evidence from the energy star program
T2  - REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS
AB  - The "Energy Star" certification of residential homes is a recent attempt in the United States to improve energy efficiency in the residential sector by incentivizing home builders to "build green." We examine the effectiveness of this program by estimating homeowners' marginal willingness to pay for Energy Star residences in Gainesville, Florida. We use single-family residential property sales in Gainesville, Florida between 1997 and 2009. Using the hedonic method, we find that homeowners are willing to pay a premium for new Energy Star homes, but that this premium fades rapidly in the resale market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessment of renovation measures for a dwelling area - Impacts on energy efficiency and building certification
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The European Union has an ambitious plan to reduce energy use and emissions by the year 2030. The building and real estate sectors have a great potential to help reduce emissions by energy efficiency. However, different energy sources and environmental standards affect the decision making of these major renovations in the existing stock. This study investigates how different renovation strategies affect the energy rating of a selected Building Environmental Assessment Tool and analyses the consequences in terms of greenhouse gas emissions for the local district heating system. Both building energy simulations and energy systems cost optimization were used to determine the energy use and local emissions. The results of different renovation scenarios were used to evaluate the rating in the selected tool and the impact in the district heating local emissions. The used methodology illustrates how energy efficient renovation impacts on the district heating system's local emissions. However, a bias towards resource classification within the Swedish Building Environmental Tool, Miljobyggnad, needs to be addressed in order to assess the impact of local emissions.

AB  - There is an active and growing literature examining the rental rate, sales price, and occupancy premiums associated with sustainable or energy efficient certified real estate. To date, the focus has rested largely on office properties and for sale single family residential properties. We examine the rental rates achieved by green multifamily properties, providing the first look at the population of LEED market-rate apartments in the United States. We find an approximate 8.9 % rental rate premium associated with LEED apartments. Moreover, this research provides the first indication that LEED certification garners an additional premium over non-certified space that identifies as green, indicating the strength of the certification signal and contributing to the longstanding discussion on the merits of certification.

TI  - Optimal behavior of responsive residential demand considering hybrid phase change materials
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - Due to communication and technology developments, residential consumers are enabled to participate in Demand Response Programs (DRPs), control their consumption and decrease their cost by using Household Energy Management (HEM) systems. On the other hand, capability of energy storage systems to improve the energy efficiency causes that employing Phase Change Materials (PCM) as thermal storage systems to be widely addressed in the building applications. In this paper, an operational model of HEM system considering the incorporation of more than one type of PCM in plastering mortars (hybrid PCM) is proposed not only to minimize the customer's cost in different DRPs but also to guaranty the habitants' satisfaction. Moreover, the proposed model ensures the technical and economic limits of batteries and electrical appliances. Different case studies indicate that implementation of hybrid PCM in the buildings can meaningfully affect the operational pattern of HEM systems in different DRPs. The results reveal that the customer's electricity cost can be reduced up to 48% by utilizing the proposed model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of the article is to provide a wide-range overview of the Hungarian housing market development since the political change in 1989. The time period monitored has brought ups-and-downs in the construction industry due to different reasons which are all worth to examine. Research is based on database of the Hungarian Central Statistical Office and EUROSTAT, and interviews with housing market professionals. The article collects influencings factors of the housing market: macro-economic indicators and influence of economic crisis in 2008, performance of the construction industry, changes in housing policy during the time period researched, status of Hungarian credit market which has the speciality of high rate of foreign currency loans. It is important to analyse why new housing construction suffered its historical bottom in 2013 or the reason behind why credits are used mainly for renovation and not for new built. Interesting point of view provides contrasting Hungarian dwelling types, tenure status, housing quality and affordability with the ones in EU and results lead to important conclusions. As construction industry provides important ratio of Hungary's GDP, it is crucial to revivify it. Data shows that especially residential market lacks projects. New regulations which came into force beginning of 2016 are expected to help housing market and construction industry. Although results of these will be reflected in statistics only after a while professionals estimate that housing market will warm up already in 2016 and will bring new projects latest by 2017. Regulations change too often in Hungary thus quick reaction of population is expected not to miss this support. Despite hurry design and construction hopefully thorough job will be done so that houses will be built for long-term in high quality and with good real value. Unfortunately, goals of new regulations do not show commitment regarding environmental awareness or sustainability. First version of the law included that new houses and flats which are built with help of state support must achieve high level in energy efficiency but this condition evaporated in a short time.

AB  - In Australia, the trend of being energy efficient within modern multi-storey buildings has been more popular in recent years. However, lack of attention has been given to the residential housing in terms of the perceived benefits and actual performance. This research is to investigate the gap between the original expectation and the occupants' satisfaction in residential energy efficient dwellings. It also aims to analyze the relationship between the satisfaction level and both the initial as well as the ongoing cost of energy efficient dwellings in South Australia. Finally, it determines whether the initial cost is proportional to the financial savings. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - NANO, BIO AND GREEN - TECHNOLOGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, SGEM 2016, VOL III
CP  - 16th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM 2016)
AB  - Housing market in the Czech Republic, especially the segment of family houses, has been undergoing changes recently, but it predominantly consists of older and mostly energy inefficient real estate property. Nevertheless, new conditions and challenges are bringing a considerable increase in the number of new energy-efficient houses, simultaneously raising the question of the way of their valuation.
   The International and European Valuation Standards provide three general approaches to valuation of a real estate. The approaches should be adopted and used appropriately to determine the final market value. However, the contribution rate of the individual approaches to market value is strongly dependent on characteristics and the potential of the house to be valued. The awareness of potential buyers of energy efficiency in the future and the rate of its projection into price is one of the most important elements.
   The paper presents the development in the Czech Republic and reveals certain recommendations and specifics for valuation of energy-efficient houses.

T2  - RPTSS 2015 - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH PARADIGMS TRANSFORMATION IN SOCIAL SCIENCES 2015
CP  - International Conference on Research Paradigms Transformation in Social Sciences (RPTSS)
AB  - One of the key issues that determine the wellbeing of young people in Britain is their prospect of living and raising a family in a house of their own. In an ideal scenario, a young professional couple should be able to purchase a comfortable and affordable home as they need it, but in the recent years, the affordability of new homes for young people has become a problem as house prices rose. Moreover, the British government is committed to reducing Britain's carbon emissions [1], and for future home owners this means that new houses must meet strict criteria ensuring that they are equipped with energy saving features that make them eco friendly. Britian's ideal ecohouse of the future is a very high energy efficiency rating home, a zero carbon home. However, these requirements increase the building cost of new homes, which in turn can raise the house prices even further. This article surveys new energy saving solutions which are being implemented in British homes and evaluates their effectiveness and cost. Using desk top research as the method for this enquiry the authors attempt to sketch the image of the (possible) house of the future - a type of dwelling that new home buyers should be buying in years to come - if they can afford it.

TI  - Improving the airtightness in an existing UK dwelling: The challenges, the measures and their effectiveness
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Air infiltration, occurring through gaps in the building envelope, can contribute up to one third of total heat losses associated with older UK dwellings [1]. Therefore, reducing the rate of air leakage (i.e. improving air 'tightness') can have a positive effect in terms of decreasing space heating requirements.
   This study presents an investigation of the effectiveness of airtightness measures applied in a retrofit context to a UK dwelling. A phased programme of refurbishment work was undertaken to a test dwelling at the University of Nottingham campus, UK. Evaluation techniques, including building energy modelling (SAP 2009), air pressurisation tests and thermal imaging, were performed. The study demonstrates that the use of conventional draught-proofing measures can achieve a reduction in air permeability of over 30% when compared with the house base case value of 15.57 m(3)/(h.m(2)) @ 50 Pa. This reduction was only achievable with close attention to installation detail. Further measures of service penetration and floor sealing enabled the air permeability to be reduced to as low as 4.74 m(3)/(h m(2)) @ 50 Pa.
   Modelling of the test dwelling predicted an initial space heating supply energy requirement of 32,373 kWh, which was reduced to 23,197 kWh by a combination of the air tightness measures, insulation, and system (boiler and ventilation) improvements. Air tightness measures alone contributed to approximately 9% of the predicted total reduction, half of which was due to relatively straight-forward draught-proofing. Other more advanced air tightness measures were considerably more expensive, though cheaper approaches to their application could help reduce payback times. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

CP  - 3rd International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conference on Social Sciences and Arts, SGEM 2016
AB  - One of the objectives of the EU Single Market Strategy adopted in 2015 is to enable Europeans to work wherever they choose in the EU. To fulfill this objective and to make it easier to exercise the freedom to provide services and freedom of establishment, the professional qualification recognition has to be guaranteed. When a profession is regulated in the EU country of destination, professionals with equivalent qualifications from another EU country may need to get those qualifications recognized before they can start working there. The European Professional Card (EPC) is created to help in this process.
   The European Professional Card was introduced by the Directive 2013/55/EU which amends the Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications. Directive 2013/55/EU introduces a common framework for training (CTF) which provides automatic recognition on the basis of accepted minimum common set of knowledge, skills and competencies required to perform a certain profession. The directive promotes the ECTS system (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation system) and introduces the possibility of expressing the duration of program in ECTS credits within the program as defined in Directive 2005/36/EC which acquired qualifier necessary for dealing a regulated profession.
   The introduction of the European Professional Card is one of the major achievements of the Directive 2013/55/EU. It was created to provide a system of recognition of professional experience and to promote automatic recognition of this experience across the EU as the response for different obstacles to the core principles of the Single Market for services that traditionally exist within the territory of different member states.
   In 2015 the European Commission adopted the implementing regulation to introduce the European Professional Card for the first five professions: general care nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, real estate agents and mountain guides who were selected among those having expressed an interest, following thorough consultations with stakeholders and Member States.
   Authors in the paper analyze the current situation within the European Union Single Market for services and possibilities for professionals to go cross border with no obstacles including the analysis of the European Court of Justice judgments as an important source of the EU law. The result of this analysis will give the answer on actual value of the European Professional Card for the business practi

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis of Factors Affecting Decision-Making for a Housing Energy Retrofit: A Case Study
T2  - CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2016: OLD AND NEW CONSTRUCTION TECHNOLOGIES CONVERGE IN HISTORIC SAN JUAN
CP  - Construction Research Congress
AB  - In the United States, over 60% of the housing inventory is more than 30 years old. One way to improve energy efficiency of those aged buildings is through housing retrofits. One of the main challenges of housing retrofit projects is making the decision about the amount of investment that results in maximum long-time benefits. In terms of life-cycle cost for a housing retrofit, different factors may affect the type of retrofitting alternatives to be implemented in the project. This research first introduces an optimization model for decision-making in housing retrofit. The model incorporates the use of genetic algorithm for selecting the optimum retrofitting plan based on the minimum life-cycle cost of the building. Then using a case study through this research a sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of different factors such as service life of the building, homeowner's available budget, and discount rate of the building location on the suggested optimum retrofitting alternatives. The initial results illustrate that the retrofitting efforts could be more feasible when the service life of the building is high and the amount of discount rate is low. The results can help homeowners to make a more accurate decision for a housing energy retrofit.

CP  - ASHRAE Winter Conference
AB  - Within EBC Annex 61: Business and Technical Concepts for Deep Energy Retrofit of Public Buildings (IEA 2015) strategies are developed to increasepaceandquality of deepenergy retrofit (DER) projects in the public sector. Annex 61, Subtask A's target is to assess accomplished DER projects to defineand find optimized measure bundles from both energy-efficiency and economical perspectives in each of the participating countries. Based on general assumptions defined by the Annex 61 team, modeling studies for different types of buildings and different climate zones have been done. The following scenarios and assumptions for all national case studies have been defined.
   Scenario 1 (baseline) represents the pre-1980 standard to describe the building envelope and systems before any renovation addressing the consumption of site energy, heating, and electricity. Scenario 2 (base case) is the country-specific "business as usual" retrofit; in this case, the retrofit is initiated byageneralrepurposingandonlyconsidersminimumrequirements by the national building code. Scenario 3 has to achieve approximately 50% energy reduction relative to the baseline (Scenario 1), and Scenario 4 aims to achieve the current national "dream energy standard" (which can be the national definition for net zero energy buildings[WDBG2014], Plusenergy Standard, PassiveHouse[PHI2015a], etc.). Targets tobe reached in all scenarios are based on the site energy demand, including all kinds of energy use, such as domestic hot water (DHW), heating, cooling, lighting, household electricity, plug loads, and others.
   The results of the modeling will be different U-factors for the thermal envelope and specific HVAC and supply systems. For each component, the investment costs are calculated and a 40-year life-cycle cost analysis is prepared, considering the global costs and benefits for energy- and non-energy-related measures. To decide between different scenarios, the incremental energy-related costs and benefits of each scenario are compared to each other. In this paper, the modeling results of Austrian and German case studies are presented.
   The Austrian modeling project is a multistory housing block with four floors and 24 flats in the city of Kapfenberg, constructed in 1960-1961. The total site energy demand (DHW, heating, and supply and household electricity) of Scenario 1 is 155 kWh/m2yr (49 kBtu/ftyr) and has been reduced in Scenario 4 to 71 kWh/myr (23 kBtu/ftyr), achieving the Passive House standard (heating energy demand of 15 kWh/myr [5 kBtu/ftyr]). Measures from Scenario 2 and 3 focused only on the reduction of transmission losses (e.g., improvement of insulation, change of windows) and the reduction of infiltration losses, as these measures enable the achievement of the required energy use intensities (EUIs) in a cost-efficient way. To achieve the Austrian dream target (PassiveHousestandard[IPHAn.d.]) in Scenario 4, the implementation of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery is necessary, which means higher investment costs (higher costs for energy saved) from the cost point of view.
   The German modeling project is a compact (Building envelope area inm/building volume inm [A/V]: 0.38) multistory office block with three floors and 1680 m(18.083 ft) net floor area in the city of Darmstadt, Hesse, constructed in1962 and situated in ASHRAE Climate Zone 5. The building was refurbished in 2012 and allowed the calibration of the modeling using the performance data (Scenario 4). The total site energy demand (DHW, heating, supply and household electricity) taken as the baseline was the consumption collected from the utility bills: 236kWh/myr (75 kBtu/ftyr) heating and 20 kWh/myr (6 kBtu/ftyr) electricity. Compared to average EUIs for German office buildings < 10,000 m (< 107.639 ft), the heating consumption is 12% over average, and the electricity consumption is 18% below average. Typical for office buildings of that size and age is that air conditioning was only in use for the IT server and the restrooms, but not for the office spaces. Following the requirements of the German national building code for refurbishment of the building stock in Scenario 1 leads to a reduction of 39% of primary energy including plug loads, or 41% final energy for heating. In Scenario 2, the standards for new buildings were adopted with significant reduction of thermal bridges and air leakage and a 67% decrease in primary energy and 72% decrease in final energy for heating. Scenario 4 considered the Passive House standard for building stock and depicts exactly the situation after the refurbishment was accomplished, with 76% primary energy savings and 81% final energy for heating savings. Scenario 4 actually achieved 48 kWh/myr (14kBtu/ft yr) heating site energy after refurbishment. Because of the improved airtightness of the thermal envelope, the minimum requirements for indoor air quality required the implementation of a mechanical ventilation system with high-efficiency heat recovery but without cooling. The assessment of the lifecycle cost analysis showed the best net present value (NPV) is for Scenario 2 (adoption of building code for new buildings) while the second best is Scenario 4 (cost-optimized Passive House scenario). The main difference between the two scenarios is that Scenario 2 has only a cheap exhaust air system and Scenario 4 has a costly ventilation system with heat recovery. The added insulation for Scenario 4 has almost no impact on the NPV because the delta costs are refinanced by the energy savings.
   This paper describes the baselining and modeling process; describes the economic assumptions made for energy prices, maintenance, and other operating costs; and considers the investment costs and the cost optimization process.

TI  - SBDaaS: Smart Building Diagnostics as a Service on the Cloud
T2  - 2016 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT GREEN BUILDING AND SMART GRID (IGBSG)
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Intelligent Green Building and Smart Grid (IGBSG)
AB  - Huge amounts of data can be collected from smart buildings for accurate diagnostics. However, analyzing, storing and processing this data require huge resources as well as advanced software that implements innovative algorithms for accurate smart building diagnostics. This can be very costly for smart buildings owners. Cloud computing can provide a scalable and cost-effective platform to satisfy these needs. Cloud computing is an emerging commercial IT infrastructure model that offers to eliminate the need for clients to maintain in-house high-cost hardware, software, and network infrastructures. It also reduces or even eliminates the high-cost of recruiting technical professionals to support these infrastructures and operate the in-house IT solutions. This paper proposes a new cloud service that provides some mechanisms for smart building diagnostics that clients, smart building owners and managers, can use. This service is called Smart Building Diagnostics as a Service (SBDaaS). The paper presents an architecture developed for this service. In addition, it discusses the opportunities of utilizing such a service.

TI  - THE SPECIFICS OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET OF THE ENERGY EFFICENT BUILDINGS
T2  - 8TH ARCHITEKTURA V PERSPEKTIV 2016
CP  - 8th Architecture in Perspective Conference
AB  - The real estate market in the Czech Republic and even in other countries in the Central Europe is undergoing a change of the structure of estates which are traded there. This is due to a gradual growth of number of energy efficient buildings. However, the share of these property is in total still rather low which is besides other things caused by difficulty of their market valuation. Objective appraisal of real estates must reflect the market economy settings within the social and environmental contexts and it has to adequately react to changing needs of both real estate market and banking, construction and legislation, together with state and local authorities. This paper analyses the real estate market in the segment of modern buildings and their relationship to the traditional construction fund. It also describes the most important principles of objective valuation of energy efficient buildings, assesses motivational stimuli for development of this segment of real estate market and predicts its potential development in future.

TI  - Daylight Factor Estimation Based on Data Sampling Using Distance Weighting
T2  - 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, CPESE 2016
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Power and Energy Systems Engineering, (CPESE)
AB  - Many of the architectural design which incorporates natural light through the window design based on assumptions and empirical review that is not measurable. The entry of natural light into the space affects the level of energy efficiency to the use of artificial lighting. The large number of lumens from the light source that will fall on the surface of the room on every square feet (sq ft) would affect the value of illumination in the room. This study was conducted to determine the size of the lighting distribution of sunlight in the room. The method used is the direct measurement in the study area, collecting measurement data and map the numbers into a formula the density distribution of incoming light by using a mathematical equation to further simulate the density distribution of daylight that enters the room apartments and distribute the value of illumination with daylight factor. Simulation of light distribution daytime (daylight) used a simple method, which can result shows the distribution of light from the highest intensity to the lowest intensity. The results showed that the value of the existing distribution are useful to conduct a study follow-up study on the distribution of light in the room. Illumination distribution is expected to be useful for the design of spatial structure for architects. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The energy efficiency of corporate real estate assets The role of energy management for corporate environmental performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE
AB  - Purpose - On the basis of corporate wholesale and hypermarket stores, this study aims to investigate the relationship between energy consumption, physical building characteristics and operational sales performance and the impact of energy management on the corporate environmental performance.
   Design/methodology/approach - A very unique dataset of METRO GROUP over 19 European countries is analyzed in a sophisticated econometric approach for the timeframe from January 2011 until December 2014. Multiple regression models are applied for the panel, to explain the electricity consumption of the corporate assets on a monthly basis and the total energy consumption on an annual basis. Using Generalized Additive Models, to model nonlinear covariate effects, the authors decompose the response variables into the implicit contribution of building characteristics, operational sales performance and energy management attributes, under control of the outdoor weather conditions and spatial-temporal effects.
   Findings - METRO GROUP's wholesale and hypermarket stores prove significant reductions in electricity and total energy consumption over the analyzed timeframe. Due to the implemented energy consumption and carbon emission reduction targets, the influence of the energy management measures, such as the identification of stores associated with the lowest energy performance, was found to contribute toward a more efficient corporate environmental performance.
   Originality/value - In the context of corporate responsibility/sustainability of wholesale, hypermarket and retail corporations, the energy efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions from corporates' real estate assets is of emerging interest. Besides the insights about the energy efficiency of corporate real estate assets, the role of the energy management, contributing to a more efficient corporate environmental performance, is not yet investigated for a large European wholesale and hypermarket portfolio.

TI  - Energy efficiency: behavioural effects of occupants and the role of refurbishment for European office buildings
T2  - PACIFIC RIM PROPERTY RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB  - Energy consumption in office buildings is determined partly by fixed building characteristics, but also by the behaviour of occupants. Within the European Union, office buildings have become subject to more stringent energy efficiency regulation for new construction or extensive refurbishment, with the aim to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The study determines the influence of physical building characteristics and occupant behaviour on energy consumption, and in particular, the role of refurbishment in different intensities on energy consumption is investigated. The data-set of the Green Rating Alliance is tested to provide evidence, by applying multiple regression models for energy consumption. The results highlight considerably increased energy consumption of single-tenant compared to multi-tenant office buildings. Very large office buildings consume significantly more energy per square metre that their smaller peers. A building's modelled water consumption turns out to be a good indicator for the actual energy consumption, emphasising the importance of assessing further sustainability measures. Overall, buildings of higher age turn out to be of lower energy consumption, pointing to additional appliances and equipment in more recent buildings, to provide better services and more comfort. In general, extensive refurbishment measures account for significant higher energy use, since the overall quality of the buildings is improved with additional appliances and equipment. Testing for the interaction effect between building age and refurbishment, the results demonstrate significantly lower additional energy consumption for buildings with more recent extensive refurbishment, compared to those with refurbishment several years ago. However, the results need to be considered with precaution against deriving firm conclusions due to the small sample size and some drawbacks in the applied data-set.

TI  - SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS FOR BUILDINGS: NETWORK ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
T2  - EXPANDING BOUNDARIES: SYSTEMS THINKING IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
CP  - Sustainable Built Environment (SBE) Regional Conference
AB  - Nowadays rating systems to assess the sustainability of the built environment are available worldwide. The idea that a rating system based on indicators and a sustainability score can guarantee architectural quality, reliability, energy efficiency, economic convenience and finally a sustainability label, produces an increased value of the building on the real estate market giving an "aura" of advanced product to the building itself. It is well known that different rating systems can give a different sustainability score because similar areas of evaluation in different rating systems are not equal in term of indicators' weight. Moreover, the continuous updating of the rating systems tries to include in the assessment procedures a tailored vision coming from field experience. The building rating systems were born in the last 15 years (i. e. 1998-2004), while rating systems for urban districts are more recent (2009-2012). The paper provides a survey on the more influential and worldwide diffused rating systems, highlighting the differences in terms of organization and relationship between evaluation areas and comparing existing rating schemes with recent EU research projects and initiatives such as the "Common European framework for Sustainable Building Assessment" (CESBA) framework. The paper aims to report the preliminary analysis on the similarities and differences among rating systems, towards a harmonization of sustainability practices to be applied to new and existing buildings. A network analysis and visualization tool has been applied to show the structural analogies among rating systems through an innovative methodological approach which aims to enable a further development in this field by linking more directly these tools with computational tools used in the building lifecycle.

TI  - A Study on the Effects of Virtualization on Mobile Learning Applications in Private Cloud
T2  - GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTING, VOL II
CP  - 9th International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computing (ICGEC)
AB  - Real time communication applications including Mobile learning application can be integrated with other software applications into one platform and deployed in private clouds to reduce capital expenditure and lower overall costs of daily based maintenance and real estate required for computer hardware. As a critical component of private clouds, virtualization may adversely affect a real time communication application running in virtual machines as the layer of virtualization on the physical server adds system overhead and contributes to capacity lose. Virtualization in the mobile can enable hardware to run with less memory and fewer chips, reducing costs and increasing energy efficiency as well. It also helps to address safety and security challenges, and reduces software development and porting costs. This study will investigate how to build an effective learning environment for both the University and learners by integrating the virtualization, private cloud technology and mobile learning applications.

TI  - Assessing CO2 emissions in China's iron and steel industry: A dynamic vector autoregression model
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - Energy saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction in China is attracting increasing attention worldwide. At present, China is in the phase of rapid urbanization and industrialization, which is characterized by rapid growth of energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. China's steel industry is highly energy-consuming and pollution-intensive. Between 1980 and 2013, the carbon dioxide emissions in China's steel industry increased approximately 11 times, with an average annual growth rate of 8%. Identifying the drivers of carbon dioxide emissions in the iron and steel industry is vital for developing effective environmental policies. This study uses Vector Autoregressive model to analyze the influencing factors of the changes in carbon dioxide emissions in the industry. The results show that energy efficiency plays a dominant role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Urbanization also has significant effect on CO2 emissions because of mass urban infrastructure and real estate construction. Economic growth has more impact on emission reduction than industrialization due to the massive fixed asset investment and industrial energy optimization. These findings are important for the relevant authorities in China in developing appropriate energy policy and planning for the iron and steel industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Regional differences in the CO2 emissions of China's iron and steel industry: Regional heterogeneity
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Identifying the key influencing factors of CO2 emissions in China's iron and steel industry is vital for mitigating its emissions and formulating effective environmental protection measures. Most of the existing researches utilized time series data to investigate the driving factors of the industry's CO2 emission at the national level, but regional differences have not been given appropriate attention. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2000 to 2013 and panel data models to examine the key driving forces of CO2 emissions at the regional levels in China. The results show that industrialization dominates the industry's CO2 emissions, but its effect varies across regions. The impact of energy efficiency on CO2 emissions in the eastern region is greater than in the central and western regions because of a huge difference in R&D investment The influence of urbanization has significant regional differences due to the heterogeneity in human capital accumulation and real estate development. Energy structure has large potential to mitigate CO2 emissions on account of increased R&D investment in energy-saving technology and expanded clean energy use. Hence, in order to effectively achieve emission reduction, local governments should consider all these factors as well as regional heterogeneity in formulating appropriate mitigation policies.

TI  - Drivers for and barriers to low-energy buildings in Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - From the perspective of construction companies, this paper investigates the existence and significance of barriers and driving forces for the implementation of energy-efficient houses in Sweden. Here, eleven construction companies that build low-energy buildings comparable in performance with passive houses have been interviewed. One conclusion is that there is not one specific barrier that keeps energy-efficient housing from taking off. Instead, the barriers include a whole range of issues that have to be considered. Internal pressure has been a strong contributor to the onset of passive house constructions within the companies and the results indicate that personal commitment is central and perhaps the strongest driver. A general reflection from the interviews is that there is a need to show both construction companies and potential customers that it is possible to build passive houses and that they exist. Unlike the national building regulations, which are not considered to be relevant when it comes to energy consumption, the future building regulations from the European Union are identified as a regulatory driver. Moreover, life-cycle thinking is reported to increase among actors, but that it would be beneficial if banks as well as real estate agents could develop a comprehensive view and become better at considering energy and LCC in their capital budgeting templates. Even if the interest for passive houses is considered low among the public, the market is identified as promising among the construction companies recently actually large enough to become a driver in itself.

TI  - "Turning green into gold": a framework for energy performance contracting (EPC) in China's real estate industry
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - There is a growing interest in a sustainable built environment and green technologies are gaining worldwide attention. However, implementing green technologies usually requires more investment than using traditional technologies and the payback period tends to be very long. In China, most developers sell their properties and subsequently transfer the ownership to customers. Hence, a crucial problem for promoting green construction is that developers cannot obtain economic profits ("gold") from implementing "green" technologies. Meanwhile, other stakeholders, such as property management companies, are also hesitant to adopt green technologies because of the large investment involved and their lack of experience. To tackle this problem, an energy performance contracting (EPC) based framework is proposed, to turn "green" investment into "gold" benefit by careful sharing of the risks existed. The framework was developed by conducting a focus group meeting with three experienced representatives from developer, property management company and energy service company respectively. A real-life case study, which includes both energy efficient system retrofit and new construction, is used to estimate the costs and benefits involved to demonstrate and verify the conceptual framework. The results show that the proposed framework can support the application of green technologies in both types of projects. Economic benefits as well as environmental benefits can be gained for the project stakeholders and the whole society. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Real estate market and building energy performance: Data for a mass appraisal approach
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - Mass appraisal is widely considered an advanced frontier in the real estate valuation field. Performing mass appraisal entails the need to get access to base information conveyed by a large amount of transactions, such as prices and property features. Due to the lack of transparency of many Italian real estate market segments, our survey has been addressed to gather data from residential property advertisements.
   The dataset specifically focuses on property offer prices and dwelling energy efficiency. The latter refers to the label expressed and exhibited by the energy performance certificate. Moreover, data are georeferenced with the highest possible accuracy: at the neighborhood level for a 76.8% of cases, at street or building number level for the remaining 232%.
   Data are related to the analysis performed in Bonifaci and Copiello [1] about the relationship between house prices and building energy performance, that is to say, the willingness to pay in order to benefit from more efficient dwellings.

TI  - Hybrid energy fuel cell based system for household applications in a Mediterranean climate
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - In this paper, a specific hybrid energy system was proposed for household applications. The hybrid energy system was assembled from a HT-PEM fuel cell stack supplied by hydrogen via a steam reformer, where finally the majority of produced electricity is used to drive a modified split heat pump system with heat recovery (that is enabled via standard modified accumulation boilers). The system is able to produce both high and low temperature heat output (in the form of hot water), cooling thermal output and electricity. Performance analysis was conducted and the specific hybrid energy system showed high value for overall energy efficiency, for the specific case examined it reached 250%. Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis was also carried out and the proposed hybrid energy system's cost is expected to be between 0.09 (sic)/kW h and 0.16 (sic)/kW h, which is certainly competitive with the current retail electricity price for households on the EU market. Additionally, the system also has environmental benefits in relation to reduced CO2 emissions, as estimated CO2 emissions from the proposed hybrid energy system are expected to be at around 9.0 gCO(2)/kW h or 2.6 times less than the emissions released from the utilization of grid electricity.

TI  - Improving energy efficiency in private rented housing: Why don't landlords act?
T2  - INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The private rented sector in England contains some of the least energy efficient properties in the country and houses more vulnerable households than any other sector. Occupants endure dangerously cold homes and fuel poverty but have no direct influence over the energy performance of their homes. The choices that occupants make regarding energy are constrained by the material characteristics of a property: something only the landlord can alter. Enduringly poor conditions in the sector indicate that an initiative that convinces landlords of the benefits of improving energy efficiency remains elusive. Based on a review of existing research and 30 interviews with landlords, this paper identifies factors which deter landlords from acting to improve energy efficiency. Factors include lack of knowledge regarding the consequences of energy inefficiency and possible solutions, the absence of direct financial incentives (the principal-agent problem), local housing market and cultural factors. It also identifies a number of motivating factors that may encourage landlords to invest in energy efficiency. It is argued that policies to tackle energy inefficiency in the sector should take account of these factors in order to improve effectiveness.

TI  - Assessment of financial potential of real estate energy efficiency investments-A discounted cash flow approach
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - Energy conservation in the real estate sector is claimed to possess significant possibilities for viable climate mitigation actions. Adopting the property investor's perspective, this paper focuses on financial performance of energy audit investments of existing office buildings. The study uses four property investment methods for assessing the financial performance of these investments. First, the paper adopts the traditional approach for assessing the profitability of an energy conservation investment: payback period, internal rates of returns and returns on investments of energy efficiency investments. Secondly, the scope is moved from energy investment to the property level and discounted cash flow (DCF) method is used to analyze the influence of the investments on the actual property value, something that has not been studied enough.
   The results reveal genuine financial advantages of energy efficiency investments at the building portfolio level, highlighting positive impacts on the property values of ca. 2.5 percent on average. Yet, the benefits of energy efficiency investments are currently not easily reached nor realized by investors. This is at least partly due to the mechanisms of distributing the potential returns of the investments between stakeholders, the lack of qualified service providers and poor understanding of overall value of energy conservation investments.

I find no evidence that electricity prices affect the propensity for consumers to choose high efficiency appliances. Point estimates are extremely small and precisely estimated. The findings suggest that price-based energy policies may be limited in the extent to which they increase investment in residential energy efficiency, which has been considered one of the lowest cost opportunities for reducing carbon emissions.

TI  - Integrating value and uncertainty in the energy retrofit analysis in real estate investment-next generation of energy efficiency assessment tools
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - Real estate professionals, such as investors, owner-occupants, and lenders who are involved in the investment decision-making process, are increasingly interested in energy efficiency investment. However, inability of current tools and techniques for a thorough financial assessment of energy retrofits has led the decision makers to focus on simple energy cost analyses as the primary basis for making energy retrofit investment and/or lending decisions. Thus, substantial non-energy cost savings as well as value implications associated with energy efficiency are often ignored and energy retrofits are undervalued. Through an extensive literature review, interviews with real estate experts, and the author's experience with energy efficiency analytics and tools development, this paper sets forth the rationales and foundations for the development of an integrated energy retrofit assessment tools to include value, risk, and uncertainty. It suggests a systematic value-based assessment process to analyze full costs and benefits associated with energy retrofit options in the context of value, while clearly articulating the risk and uncertainty. The outcome of the proposed process enables users make more informed investment decisions and drives major energy retrofit investments. As a result of applying such a value-based approach, many investment opportunities that were otherwise ignored may be realized, and therefore, the breadth and depth of energy efficiency investment will increase for the benefit of various stakeholders, including real estate professionals, governments, utilities, or other energy efficiency program sponsors.

TI  - On the use of an energy certification database to create indicators for energy planning purposes: Application in northern Italy
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Energy certification of buildings, mandatory under the European Directive EPBD provides interesting data on the thermo-physical properties and geometry of existing buildings. Although the energy certificate is intended to provide the characteristics of individual buildings, so stimulating the real estate market toward ever better energy performance, data management of the certificates issued over time, using a national or regional energy cadastre, makes available a data base which is useful for energy planning in the building sector.
   This paper provides the needed results of a benchmarking study on data from the energy cadastre of the Lombardy Region, northern Italy. By integrating data from the energy cadastre (175.778 energy certificates) with the statistical data obtained from the national census, indicators were obtained on the energy performance of existing buildings.
   The energy indicators obtained, characterised by building type and construction period, normalised as a function of Degree-Days, become an effective tool for energy planning at local and regional scales. In the specific case, the energy indicators have been used to estimate the potential for energy retrofit of existing buildings in the Lombardy Region. The same indicators can also be used by municipalities for energy planning at the municipal or district level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Action dependent heuristic dynamic programming based residential energy scheduling with home energy inter-exchange
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Residential energy scheduling is a hot topic nowadays in the background of energy saving and environmental protection worldwide. To achieve this objective, a new residential energy scheduling algorithm is developed for energy management, based on action dependent heuristic dynamic programming. The algorithm works under the circumstance of residential real-time pricing and two adjacent housing units with energy inter-exchange, which can reduce the overall cost and enhance renewable energy efficiency after long-term operation. It is designed to obtain the optimal control policy to manage the directions and amounts of electricity energy flux. The algorithm's architecture is mainly constructed based on neural networks, denoting the learned characteristics in the linkage of layers. To get close to real situations, many constraints such as maximum charging/discharging power of batteries are taken into account. The absent energy penalty cost is developed for the first time as a part of the performance index function. When the environment changes, the residential energy scheduling algorithm gains new features and keeps adapting in real-time operations. Simulation results show that the developed algorithm is beneficial to energy conversation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Handling data uncertainties when using Swedish energy performance certificate data to describe energy usage in the building stock
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The EU directive to create Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) for all buildings was implemented in Sweden as a tool to advise building owners on possible improvements and to give energy efficiency visible market value. The Swedish EPCs include measured energy usage. Currently 82% of the buildings have EPCs; this database makes it possible to create overview and to validate models of the building stock in an unprecedented high detail.
   However, the process of issuing Swedish EPCs has received criticism from real estate agents, real estate owners, Energy Experts, and Boverket, the national agency responsible for EPC data collection. In order to use the EPC data for describing the building stock it is necessary to assess and remediate the data quality. This has been done by merging the EPC data with databases of the Housing and Urban Development office and one of the larger real estate companies in Sweden, Riksbyggen. The Swedish EPC specific area measurement, Atemp, is found to vary according to methods of derivation. The method of estimating Atemp is improved using a stepwise regression model (R-2 = 0.979). This method can be applied to subsets of EPCs depending on the intended way of describing the building stock. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - REDUCING THE OPERATING COSTS OF AN APARTMENT BUILDING
T2  - SLOVAK JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
AB  - Circulation pumps are mechanical devices, which are used to create the overpressure required for the transportation of a heat-transfer medium in heating technology as well as in other related technologies. In a circulation pump the mechanical energy generated by the drive machine - an electric motor is transformed to hydraulic energy, which consists of kinetic and static energy. In the pipeline of a heating system circulation pumps represent a source of hydraulic energy (positive differential pressure), which is consumed to transport the heat-transfer medium. During the flow, the heat-transfer medium puts up resistance to the so-called passive resistors, which consist of pressure losses from friction in the pipes and pressure losses due to local resistance. In this article the authors analyze the effect of a circulation pump on the operating costs in an apartment building. Different types of circulating pumps, ranging from the most unfavorable to the optimal, were selected.

TI  - Energy Performance and Thermal Comfort of a High Efficiency House: RhOME for denCity, Winner of Solar Decathlon Europe 2014
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The increase of people living in large cities and the expansion of new urban areas are keys to defining new sustainable models. It is estimated that about 70% of the EU population lives in urban areas, and it is expected to reach 80% by 2030. Consequently, it is important to find a new concept of buildings that can reduce the total energy consumption. The Solar Decathlon is an international university competition, born in 2002, created by the U.S. State Energy Department (DOE). Students are challenged to design and operate a full-scale, innovative and sustainable house able to exploit solar radiation as its sole energy source. The objective of the competition is to promote research and education in sustainable architecture and solar energy fields. This paper presents an overview on the contribution of LIFT (Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Technical Physics of Roma Tre University) to the winning project of the Solar Decathlon Europe 2014 competition: The RhOME for denCity. This project consists of a building properly designed to produce a solar-powered house that is cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive.

TI  - Small might be beautiful, but bigger performs better: Scale economies in "green" refurbishments of apartment housing
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - The energy efficiency of the residential housing stock plays a key role in strategies to mitigate climate change and global warming. In this context, it is frequently argued that private investment and the quality of thermal upgrades are too low in the light of the challenges faced and the potential energy cost savings. While many authors address the potential barriers for investors to increase energy efficiency, studies on the capabilities of different investors to reduce energy requirements of their property are scarce. This study investigates potential advantages of housing company's size, i.e. economies of scale, economies of scope and institutional learning in thermal upgrades of residential housing. Based on unique data on energy consumption in 102,307 apartment buildings in Germany, we present new evidence for the advantages and disadvantages of a housing company's size in "green" retrofitting projects. Our estimations show, that large housing companies outperform private landlords by far in high effort refurbishment projects. In contrast, private landlords appear to have advantages in low effort, incremental refurbishment activities. We demonstrate that a substantial share of the advantages of larger firms can be associated with specialization (i.e. repeated projects). The results offer new options for policy makers to refine the support schemes toward a low carbon housing stock. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy poverty in China: An index based comprehensive evaluation
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Energy poverty has got increasing attention during the latest three decades. Measuring energy poverty is the premise of policy making to alleviate energy poverty. There is no unified energy poverty measurement that has been widely accepted. This paper reviews the commonly used energy poverty measurements through classifying them into three categories: energy service availability, energy service quality, and satisfaction of energy demand for human's survival and development. This paper also analyzes the suitability of the commonly used energy poverty measurement for China from the prospective of data availability and index applicability. Furthermore, we construct a new energy poverty comprehensive evaluation index in this study, and the index is illustrated to evaluate regional energy poverty in China. The evaluation results indicate that China's energy poverty showed an alleviating trend from 2000 to 2011, and during this period, China's energy service availability improved slightly; energy consumption cleanliness showed no significant change; energy management completeness decreased with fluctuations; and household energy affordability and energy efficiency improved continually. In addition, China's regions show different characteristics of energy poverty. For example, Middle reaches of Yangtze River region showed the worst energy availability and Eastern coastal region showed the worst energy management completeness. Several policy implications for energy poverty alleviation are also proposed in this study, including, for instance, increasing investment on energy infrastructure, and spreading energy management organization in rural area; decreasing relative cost on household commercial energy consumption, and encourage the utilization of modern, clean and efficient household energy consumption equipment.

TI  - Green real estate development in China: State of art and prospect agenda-A review
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Green real estate development is one of measures being implemented to reduce negative impacts of the building industry on the environment, society, and economy. However, there is lack of a systematic review of this large number of studies that is critical for the future endeavor. This paper reviews the existing body of knowledge related to green development. At first, the common research themes on green real estate development were identified, including concept, measure, business, and result. Then, the connotation and denotation of green real estate development was introduced in four dimensions. Third, the stakeholders of green real estate development and its benefits and costs were expatiated. Then, how to realize the green real estate development and its current weakness were analyzed in various aspects. It is found that the existing studies mainly focus on the environmental aspect of green building, other dimensions of sustainability of green building, especially the social sustainability is largely overlooked. Future research opportunities were identified such as the innovation of evaluation systems, integration of planning and design frameworks, management mechanisms and financing modes, and future proofing.

TI  - Remarks on the green retrofitting of historic buildings in Italy
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Latest European Union programs related to energy efficiency underline the need for retrofitting existing buildings, which are responsible for 40% of EU final energy consumption. Although new buildings can be constructed with high performance levels, the majority of the building stock, characterized by a low energy performance, still needs renovation. Thanks to its potential to deliver high energy and CO2 savings, green retrofitting of existing buildings can thus play a pivotal role in creating a sustainable future. In this context, interventions on buildings constructed before 1945 (commonly defined as "historic buildings") mean a higher benefit/cost ratio, because, in many cases, green retrofitting can be linked to unavoidable refurbishment works and renovated buildings can take on an interesting market value. However, an important part of these historic buildings in Italy is composed of cultural heritage buildings; these buildings require a specific design approach, and green retrofitting is often not attractive from an economic point of view. The remarks reported in this work aim to stimulate a discussion on operational procedures, barriers and challenges that investors, professional figures and supervisory authorities can encounter when they are engaged in the green retrofitting of historic buildings belonging to Italian cultural heritage.

TI  - Extra cost analyses of two apartment buildings for achieving nearly zero and low energy buildings
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - The nZEB (nearly zero energy building) requirements taking effect in 2021 have induced the interest about additional cost and technical solutions amongst real-estate developers, construction companies, architects and engineers. The objectives of this study are twofold, first to determine the cost-optimal energy efficiency level for two lately built apartment buildings in a cold climate of Estonia, and secondly, which are the proper measures to achieve low energy and nZEB requirement levels. The influence of high-efficiency external walls, roofs, windows, ventilation units and solar collectors on energy use and construction costs were studied by using multi-stage methodology for reducing the number of combinations. The results show that since 2010 the cost optimal primary energy level has shifted from 145 kWh/m(2) to 110 kWh/m(2), but achieving nZEB level of 100 kWh/m(2) still requires relatively high additional investments. With initial measures, nZEB requirements were not fulfilled in the studied cases, but the solutions close to nZEB required extra investment of 65 /m(2) i.e. 4-7% compared to the actual buildings. Low energy building level needed additional investments up to 2%. In both case studies remarkably better energy efficiency level could have been achieved with lower construction costs.

TI  - The effects of the energy price reform on households consumption in Iran
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The substantial subsidizing of energy prices over the years has led to high energy consumption, inefficiencies, fiscal pressures, and environmental problems in Iran. To address the increasing socio-economic problems associated with the energy subsidies, the government embarked on an aggressive energy price reform through which energy subsidies were removed and cash handouts were given to all households in 2010. In this paper, I analyze the effectiveness of the energy price reform in Iran by estimating energy demand elasticities for households in different income groups. I apply a two-stage consumer optimization model and estimate the system of energy expenditures shares using the household budget survey data for the period 2001-2008. The results show that the overall price elasticities of demand are small, but income elasticities are close to one. The results also indicate heterogeneous responses to energy price and income changes in different income groups. Specifically, the urban households show stronger response to price changes, but rural households, particularly mid-income households, to income changes. These findings suggest that the current policy of price increases would not solely be able to reduce energy consumption and, therefore, it should be geared towards increasing energy efficiency through a series of price and non-price measures.

TI  - An agent-based model for energy service companies
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The residential housing sector is a major consumer of energy accounting for approximately one third of carbon emissions in the United Kingdom. Achieving a sustainable, low-carbon infrastructure necessitates a reduced and more efficient use of domestic energy supplies. Energy service companies offer an alternative to traditional providers, which supply a single utility product to satisfy the unconstrained demand of end users, and have been identified as a potentially important actor in sustainable future economies. An agent-based model is developed to examine the potential of energy service companies to contribute to the large scale upgrading of household energy efficiency, which would ultimately lead to a more sustainable and secure energy infrastructure. The migration of households towards energy service companies is described by an attractiveness array, through which potential customers can evaluate the future benefits, in terms of household energy costs, of changing provider. It is shown that self-financing is a limiting factor to the widespread upgrading of residential energy efficiency. Greater reductions in household energy costs could be achieved by committing to longer term contracts, allowing upgrade costs to be distributed over greater time intervals. A steadily increasing cost of future energy usage lends an element of stability to the market, with energy service companies displaying the ability to retain customers on contract expiration. The model highlights how a greater focus on the provision of energy services, as opposed to consumable products, presents a viable approach to reducing future energy costs and usage.

TI  - Energy Price Reform and Household Welfare: The Case of Turkey
T2  - ENERGY JOURNAL
AB  - A price reform in Turkey increased the residential electricity tariff by more than 50 percent in 2008. The reform, aimed at encouraging energy efficiency and private investment, sparked considerable policy debate about its potential impact on household welfare. This paper estimates a short-run residential electricity demand function to evaluate the distributional impact of the tariff increase. The analysis allows heterogeneity in households' price sensitivity and the model is estimated using a nationally representative sample of 8,572 Turkish households. The results suggest that rich households in Turkey are three times as responsive in adjusting consumption to price changes as poor households are. In addition, the welfare loss of the poorest income quintile-measured by the change in consumer surplus as a percentage of income-is 2.9 times that of the wealthiest.

TI  - Solid-wall U-values: heat flux measurements compared with standard assumptions
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - The assumed U-values of solid walls represent a significant source of uncertainty when estimating the energy performance of dwellings. The typical U-value for UK solid walls used for stock-level energy demand estimates and energy certification is 2.1 Wm(-2) K-1. A re-analysis (based on 40 brick solid walls and 18 stone walls) using a lumped thermal mass and inverse parameter estimation technique gives a mean value of 1.3 +/- 0.4 Wm(-2) K-1 for both solid wall types. Among the many implications for policy, this suggests that standard UK solid-wall U-values may be inappropriate for energy certification or for evaluating the investment economics of solid-wall insulation. For stock-level energy modelling, changing the assumed U-value for solid walls reduces the estimated mean annual space heating demand by 16%, and causes a proportion of the stock to change Energy Performance Certification (EPC) band. The analysis shows that the diversity of energy use in domestic buildings may be as much influenced by heterogeneity in the physical characteristics of individual building components as it is by variation in occupant behaviour. Policy assessment and guidance material needs to acknowledge and account for this variation in physical building characteristics through regular grounding in empirical field data.

TI  - Does energy efficiency matter to home-buyers? An investigation of EPC ratings and transaction prices in England
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates whether energy performance ratings, as measured by mandatory Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are reflected in the sale prices of residential properties. This is the first large-scale empirical study of this topic in England involving 333,095 dwellings sold at least twice in the period from 1995 to 2012. Applying hedonic regression and an augmented repeat sales regression, we find a positive relationship between the energy efficiency rating of a dwelling and the transaction price per square metre. The price effects of superior energy performance tend to be higher for terraced dwellings and flats compared to detached and semi-detached dwellings. The evidence is less clear-cut for rates of house price growth but remains supportive of a positive association. Overall, the results of this study suggest that energy efficiency labels have a measurable and significant impact on house prices in England. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Heat savings and heat generation technologies: Modelling of residential investment behaviour with local health costs
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The trade-off between investing in energy savings and investing in individual heating technologies with high investment and low variable costs in single family houses is modelled for a number of building and consumer categories in Denmark. For each group the private economic cost of providing heating comfort is minimised. The private solution may deviate from the socio-economical optimal solution and we suggest changes to policy to incentivise the individuals to make choices more in line with the socioeconomic optimal mix of energy savings and technologies.
   The households can combine their primary heating source with secondary heating e.g. a woodstove. This choice results in increased indoor air pollution with fine particles causing health effects. We integrate health cost due to use of woodstoves into household optimisation of heating expenditures.
   The results show that due to a combination of low costs of primary fuel and low environmental performance of woodstoves today, included health costs lead to decreased use of secondary heating. Overall the interdependence of heat generation technology- and heat saving-choice is significant. The total optimal level of heat savings for private consumers decrease by 66% when all have the option to shift to the technology with lowest variable costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Understanding and addressing business needs and sustainability challenges: lessons from Devens eco-industrial park
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Attracting and retaining companies is critical for successful development of eco-industrial parks. By examining and addressing the main business needs and sustainability challenges, policy makers, developers and other champions, can promote both business value and social value creation. This paper provides valuable lessons from Devens, Massachusetts, an eco-industrial park established in 1993. Based on 29 interviews with local organizations (30% participation rate) the study reports on key business needs and sustainability challenges of local organizations and how Devens Enterprise Commission has worked to address these as part of its vision for Sustainable Devens. The study found that access to infrastructure - such as rail, green buildings and roads - was the most important factor for companies to locate to Devens, followed by the lower cost of real estate (59%) and tax benefits (52%). Top two sustainability challenges for Devens companies included improving energy efficiency and improving materials efficiency. Eighty six percent of Devens organizations reported partnering with others locally, and 79% said their organizations could benefit from such partnerships in the future. Companies were most interested in partnering around joint sourcing, infrastructure and knowledge sharing. The study confirmed that local government efforts to develop Devens infrastructure and establish supportive sustainability policies and programs were in line with business needs and a key factor for Devens' success. It confirmed earlier research on the role of industrial ecology as a cluster development policy and the importance of diversity of firms, trust, sustainability policies, and supporting network development as key to creating both business and social value.

TI  - Modelling energy retrofit investments in the UK housing market A microeconomic approach
T2  - SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Purpose - Improving the energy efficiency of the existing residential building stock has been identified as a key policy aim in many countries. The purpose of this paper is to review the extant literature on investment decisions in domestic energy efficiency and presents a model that is both grounded in microeconomic theory and empirically tractable.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study develops a modified and extended version of an existing microeconomic model to embed the retrofit investment decision in a residential property market context, taking into account tenants' willingness to pay and cost-reducing synergies. A simple empirical test of the link between energy efficiency measures and housing market dynamics is then conducted.
   Findings - The empirical data analysis for England indicates that where house prices are low, energy efficiency measures tend to increase the value of a house more in relative terms compared to higher-priced regions. Second, where housing markets are tight, landlords and sellers will be successful even without investing in energy efficiency measures. Third, where wages and incomes are low, the potential gains from energy savings make up a larger proportion of those incomes compared to more affluent regions. This, in turn, acts as a further incentive for an energy retrofit. Finally, the UK government has been operating a subsidy scheme which allows all households below a certain income threshold to have certain energy efficiency measures carried out for free. In regions, where a larger proportion of households are eligible for these subsidies, the authors also expect a larger uptake.
   Originality/value - While the financial metrics of retrofit measures are by now well understood, most of the existing studies tend to view these investments in isolation, not as part of a larger bundle of considerations by landlords and owners of how energy retrofits might influence a property's rent, price and appreciation rate. In this paper, the authors argue that establishing this link is crucial for a better understanding of the retrofit investment decision.

To searching this regard, the cost-optimal methodology based on the global cost was defined providing a. tool to assess different nearly-zero energy scenarios. Nowadays, the cost-optimal analysis is used as a decision-making tool between different energy design alternatives mostly on a. theoretical level; but it has spread little among the professional field. The aim of this paper is to give a. more holistic and all-comprehensive approach to the cost-optimal methodology. This paper proposes and applies a modified approach of the cost-optimal evaluation, which will lead to the achievement of more interesting results for all. the actors involved, including investors and final-users. This study highlights the usefulness of including not only costs but also benefits that can derive from each energy design scenario. Choosing different energy efficiency solutions, the related benefits evaluation could turn the tables. Different kinds of benefits could be considered as the increase of the real estate market value, the enhancement of the indoor comfort, the reduction of CO2 emissions and others. Thus, a proposal of how quantifying these qualitative benefits in monetary terms is shown to introduce them in the global cost formula. Actually, benefits conversion into monetary values is the most challenging issue. Precisely, this paper shows a. list of benefits that can affect the choice of different envelope and HVAC system solutions, pointing out their influence on the global cost evaluation. Certainly, introducing benefits in the global cost formula means using a more holistic and complete approach, while the already complex degree of the cost-optimal methodology due to the numerous input data increases. To validate the reviewed global cost formula, it will be necessary to apply it to various case studies. (C) 2015 The, Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Modelling the effect of energy performance certificate rating on property value in the Belfast housing market
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to investigate the relationship between energy performance and property sale price in the Belfast housing market. How energy efficiency is contributes to sale price and thus appraisal value is of growing concern. The obligatory measurement of energy efficiency in private dwellings seeks to encourage improvements in energy performance. This may be capitalised into property value and may stimulate demand for energy-efficient buildings. However, the relationship between energy performance and property value remains nebulous, complex and under-researched - in part due to data limitations.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a hedonic pricing specification, this paper measures the effect of energy performance certificates (EPCs) on residential property value. It examines the relationship between 3,797 residential sales transactions across the Belfast housing market, showing the percentage effect on property value with respect to energy performance.
   Findings - The results indicate a small but positive relationship between better energy performance and higher selling prices. Nonetheless, the findings point towards strong preference, demand tastes and a complex intra-relationship between EPCs and their capitalisation into property value. Pertinently, the findings point towards any energy-efficient-related price effect affect to be marginal alongside more "quality"-based market behaviours.
   Research limitations/implications - Analogous with other studies, data deficiencies and a lack of incorporating price determining variables (missing determinants) such as heating type and glazing type introduces omitted variable bias and endogeneity problems within the model structure.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to emerging literature and policy debate surrounding the measurement and implementation of energy-efficiency certification through a greater understanding of energy performance characteristics in determining property value.

TI  - Reforming housing regulation: delivering performance improvement together with affordability
T2  - LIVING AND LEARNING: RESEARCH FOR A BETTER BUILT ENVIRONMENT
CP  - 49th International Conference of the Architectural-Science-Association
AB  - In developed economies a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions result from energy demand in the building sector. Many countries have recognized the need to mandate building energy performance standards as a key element of a national energy or climate change policy. The Commonwealth of Australia included energy efficiency provisions in the national Building Code early last decade. This initiative has not been without controversy or resistance from some industry stakeholders. Typically such opposition is predicated on the assertion that more stringent energy efficiency requirements, particularly in the residential sector, would detrimentally impact on housing affordability. The State of Victoria significantly upgraded its residential energy efficiency requirements in 2004. This study of the new standard [the 5-Star Standard] investigates its effectiveness as an instrument of energy policy, testing the assumption that more stringent regulatory requirements are at odds with housing affordability, used here in its commonly understood form of initial capital cost. The analysis concludes that the 5-Star Standard has delivered significant greenhouse abatement; and encouraged industry innovation in a way that embodies regulatory best practice; while at the same time not compromising housing affordability for consumers or impacting negatively on the local housing market overall.

TI  - Holistic Energy Upgrade of Dwellings. A Resource Management Optimization Approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH
AB  - Retrofit actions in buildings are optimized through a holistic approach, which investigates the interactions among the potential energy efficiency measures (EEMs) by considering financing limitations, leading in this way to the optimum allocation of the available budget. An approach is proposed to this aim, including pre-selection of the most promising EEMs, detailed cost estimations, design of experiments (DOE) and building simulations, analysis of the effects and interactions between the measures and a multi-variable optimization. Two objective functions are regarded, the energy performance of the dwelling and the cost of the applicable EEMs. In addition to the optimum resources allocation, a strategy to reach a target energy class is formulated, securing the effective exploitation of the available funds. The approach is demonstrated in a dwelling, and reveals the complications when a holistic optimization focusing on the envelope, the machinery and the use of renewables, is simultaneously attempted. Overlapping between the EEMs and reversals in their priorities, with increasing the available budget for the retrofit, are realized.

TI  - Implementing energy saving measures A decision support tool for corporate real estate management
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to propose a decision support tool that would aid decision-makers to implement energy-saving measures efficiently in a corporate real estate.
   Design/methodology/approach - The tool consists of a system dynamic model that allows describing and quantifying the complex interaction between potential maintenance scenarios, external energy factors and case-specific conditions. In addition, to include the uncertainty of some of the input variables related to the external energy factors, Monte Carlo simulation has been applied.
   Findings - A case study of a city hall in The Netherlands showed the usability of the proposed tool. Over the selected period of 20 years, applying the chosen set of interventions, the simulation showed possible gains in the net present value and significant decrease of energy consumption and carbon emission. Municipal officials and consultants verified the tool for energy efficiency.
   Research limitations/implications - Although the tool has proved its functionality in one case study, to test its robustness, additional case studies would be preferable.
   Practical implications - The assessment tool can help organizations in assessing energy-efficient maintenance scenarios that include multiple technical energy efficiency interventions as a part of other maintenance activities.
   Originality/value - There are numerous ways to increase building's energy efficiency, but a lack of knowledge is often hindering the enhancement of maximal benefits. A tool that would assess both financial and environmental benefits of potential technical intervention would provide useful insights into corporate's real estate current and possible future energy performance. This would aid corporations in making better decisions regarding finances, and on the long run, it will bring an improved corporate image.

TI  - Air pressure difference between indoor and outdoor or staircase in multi-family buildings with exhaust ventilation system in Finland
T2  - 6TH INTERNATIONAL BUILDING PHYSICS CONFERENCE (IBPC 2015)
CP  - 6th International Building Physics Conference (IBPC)
AB  - Pressure differences between outdoors and indoors influence indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and building physics of the building envelope. This paper focuses on measurements of pressure difference values of about 152 apartments from 26 multifamily buildings in Finland. Measured data include pressure differences between indoor spaces and both outdoors and staircases before and after renovation. In buildings equipped with mechanical exhaust, the pressure differences between indoors and outdoors before renovation varied from + 10,1 to -95,0 Pa (average -7,8 Pa), and between indoors and staircases from -3,5 to -6,0 Pa (average -18,6 Pa), being lower than -5 Pa in 36% of the buildings. In naturally ventilated buildings, the pressure differences between indoors and outdoors were lower than -5 Pa in 44% of the buildings. The average pressure differences after renovation in nine buildings equipped with mechanical exhaust were slightly higher (-19,1 Pa against outdoor and -9,0 Pa against staircase). A possible reason for higher negative pressure could be that the airtightness of building was improved by renovation, but the ventilation system was not balanced accordingly. Improving energy efficiency (EE) could effect on pressure difference either positively or negatively. Measured pressure difference between indoors and outdoors or staircase before and after renovation could be a possible indicator when assessing the impacts of improving EE on IEQ and occupant satisfaction.

TI  - Proposed Installation of a Low-Cost Ceiling System in Low Cost Housing
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-THIRD CONFERENCE ON THE DOMESTIC USE OF ENERGY
CP  - Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on the Domestic Use of Energy
AB  - Existing formal low-cost houses in South Africa have been shown to be very thermally and energy inefficient. This is problematic for the country since the government has built roughly 2.8 million of these houses to date.
   Inefficiency in these houses can be effectively addressed by installing ceilings, but the cost thereof is unfortunately too high to be affordable to the applicable sector of the population. New options need to be considered to reduce costs.
   Research has shown that practically any material can be used as a ceiling if it provides a barrier to heat flow and eliminates infiltration. The material should ideally possess good thermal properties and comply with standard building regulations, but most importantly, it must be very cheap and easy to install.
   The low-cost ceiling proposed in this paper has all of these attributes, and installation thereof could result in substantial energy savings, improved indoor comfort, and a better quality of life.

TI  - Historic Buildings and Energetic Requalification A Model for the Selection of Technologically Advanced Interventions
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS - ICCSA 2015, PT III
CP  - 15th International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA)
AB  - The recovery and enhancement of historic buildings require interventions aimed also at the energetic requalification. Indeed, on one side there is a growing attention to the reuse of these buildings not only for conservative purposes, but even for economic and environmental aims; by forcing to include in the project even the energy efficiency improvement. On the other side, the current legislation on environmental sustainability in construction gives clear guidelines in energetic improvement object regarding the entire real estate assets, including historic buildings.
   The paper aims to define a technical-economic model for the selection of technologically advanced interventions useful to improve the buildings energy performance of historical and architectural interest. This can happens by respecting the needs and regulations on the protection of the valued property.
   The software implementation for the energy characterization of the historic building and the use of cost-benefit analysis, allow to drawing up an analysis protocol to support investment decisions. The issues research about the low thermal and acoustic insulation of the building envelopment and inefficient plants leads to outline intervention strategies and corresponding technical solutions, listed in detail in the article.
   The research appears important on the theoretic side because rationalizes the various phases necessary for the selection of the energetic requalification interventions, for which the cash flows analysis is essential to ensure the financial sustainability of the initiative. It's also true in operative terms since it provides an easy instrumentation to professionals and operators in this sector to lead towards technologically efficient interventions, profitable in management phase and respectful of the historical and architectural values of the built heritage.

TI  - Energy efficiency of listed buildings in L'Eixample District in Valencia
T2  - VERNACULAR ARCHITECTURE: TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
CP  - International Conference on Vernacular Heritage, Sustainability and Earthen Architecture
AB  - In Europe, the 25% of the final energy consumption corresponds to households, being the heating/cooling of dwelling responsible for about 70% of this amount. The improvement of the energy performance of Europe's residential building stock is crucial to achieve the EU's 2020 targets. Upgrading the thermal efficiency of listed buildings, considering the use of traditional materials and construction methods besides being of architectural or historical interest is a challenge. The residential district of l'Eixample in Valencia (Spain), built after the city walls demolition in 1865, is where the majority of the Valencian Art Nouveau heritage is located, with more than 25% of the residential buildings listed in different grades. This paper offers information about the energy efficiency assessment of those residential listed buildings, describing different "heritage friendly" measures and proposals for improving their thermal efficiency, considering economic and environmental costs as well as dwellings' loss of floor area.

TI  - How does energy efficiency influence the Market Value of office buildings in Germany and does this effect increase over time?
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - The paper aims to estimate the effect of energy efficiency on the Market Value of office buildings and consider whether this effect increases over time.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors analyze a dataset of office building valuations from 2009 to 2011, provided by the German Investment Property Database. The authors use hedonic regression models to determine the effect of energy efficiency and energy consumption on Market Values. Using generalized additive models (GAM) for modeling nonlinear covariate effects, the authors control for further building characteristics and location. Due to the small sample size, the authors introduce an innovative econometric approach that mitigates this problem.
   Findings - Mainly due to the small sample size, and in spite of the newly developed econometric methodology, the authors do not find clear evidence of the relationship between energy efficiency and the Market Value. However, the study nonetheless provides interesting insights into the composition of office building Market Values in Germany.
   Originality/value - In addition to the empirical results for the German office market, the main contribution of this paper lies in the econometric methodology. Beside the application of cutting-edge statistical techniques, the authors develop a method for handling datasets, for which the variable of interest is rarely observed, leveraging on the total available data. Thus, the methodology offers promising prospects for future research in similar settings.

TI  - How do office buildings take advantage of energy efficiency? A study of the relationship between operating expenses and energy certification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This research examines the relationship of operating expenses and energy certification in US offices. Data for four markets over a period from Q1 2007 to Q1 2011 is used. EnergyStar certification scores are used to determine the level of energy efficiency and a hedonic pricing method to model operating expenses. The results indicate a positive but non-linear relationship between costs and efficiency. Out of a number of considered explanations this seems to be best explained by initial technological difficulties in implementing energy efficiency, a self-selection bias influencing the data or a combination of different effects.

AB  - Space heating cost allocation according to actual consumption can be one possible solution for saving energy as residents are more motivated to regulate indoor air temperature. Introduction of heat cost allocators is a technique which can be used to ensure that the consumer pays only for the heat supplied to him. Installation of allocators increases the motivation of inhabitants to regulate indoor temperatures and thereby reduce heat consumption. Nevertheless, different criterions need to be taken into account in order to fairly allocate the heat costs in each apartment. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - AESTIMUM
AB  - The recent dispositions related to the energy performance of buildings, launched by the European Directives 2002/91/ EC and 2010/31/EU, turned attention to the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).
   The aim of this study is to investigate the economic effects of the recent Italian statutory provisions related to energy performance of buildings on listing behaviour. With this aim an hedonic regression analysis is performed, in order to measure the impact of EPC level on listing prices. The study, based on a set of more than 500 housing property asset collected in 2012 from real estate advertisements websites, is focused on the Turin real estate market as a case study. Furthermore this paper contributes to the early limited literature on implication of the impact of EPC level on Italian housing market, representing one of the first systematic evidence about the energy certifications in the housing listing prices.

TI  - Innovative Energy Storage for Off-Grid RES-Based Power Systems: Integration of Flywheels with Hydrogen Utilization in Fuel Cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY ENGINEERING
AB  - This work investigates the feasibility of a renewable energy sources (RES)-based stand-alone power system for electricity supply, to several simulated buildings, where energy is stored in a flywheel energy storage system (FESS). The system is assumed to be located on Naxos Island, Greece, due to the island's high wind and solar potential and was designed to cover both the load of a typical house and a country house, where the excess electricity could be sold to the grid. An innovative storage device type, consisting of flywheels and electrochemical batteries, was selected as the energy buffer. The energy produced by hydrogen used in the proton electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell (FC) charges the flywheel. This apparatus is compared to diesel generators commonly used in stationary applications. Optimization of the system, in terms of energy efficiency and economic feasibility, is also considered. The two systems were simulated using sensitivity, optimization, and simulation modeling software, and custom calculations of both energy and finance were carried out. It was found that a one-way grid connected project using state-of-the-art and totally green technologies, including hydrogen-fed PEM-FC and flywheels, can totally cover the electrical demands of a typical house and country house, obtaining cost per consumed energy as low as 1.374 and 0.097$/KWh, respectively. These results actually indicate that hydrogen technology could be a reliable energy alternative in the near future.

TI  - Energy Performance and Housing Prices
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We investigate whether mandatory energy performance certificates of existing residential properties contribute to property price premiums after the implementation of the EU directive on the energy performance of buildings in the Swedish private housing market. Analysing mandatory energy performance certificates of the 2009-2010 private housing transactions, we find that energy performance is associated with transaction price in situations when it is conditional on a reference benchmark. We also document property price premiums for energy performance within housing segments built before 1960 and those with a lower transaction price per square metre. Our results suggest that the property market values energy performance, and we make recommendations on which housing segments need policy support to encourage energy improvements.

TI  - Interaction between building design, management, household and individual factors in relation to energy use for space heating in apartment buildings
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - In Stockholm, 472 multi-family buildings with 7554 dwellings has been selected by stratified random sampling. Information about building characteristics and property management was gathered from each property owners. Energy use for space heating was collected from the utility company. Perceived thermal comfort, household and personal factors were assessed by a standardized self-administered questionnaire, answered by one adult person in each dwelling, and a proportion of each factor was calculated for each building. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple linear regression models with control for relevant factors all at the same time in the model. Energy use for heating was significantly related to the building age, type of building and ventilation, length of time since the last heating adjustment, ownership form, proportion of females, and proportion of occupants expressing thermal discomfort. How beneficial energy efficiency measures will be may depend on the relationship between energy use and factors related to the building and the property maintenance together with household and personal factors, as all these factors interact with each other. The results show that greater focus should be on real estate management and maintenance and also a need for research with a gender perspective on energy use for space heating. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating the net implicit price of energy efficient building codes on U.S. households
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Requiring energy efficiency building codes raises housing prices (or the monthly rental equivalent), but theoretically this effect might be fully offset by reductions in household energy expenditures. Whether there is a full compensating differential or how much households are paying implicitly is an empirical question. This study estimates the net implicit price of energy efficient buildings codes, IECC 2003 through IECC 2006, for American households. Using sample data from the American Community Survey 2007, a heteroskedastic seemingly unrelated estimation approach is used to estimate hedonic price (house rent) and energy expenditure models. The value of energy efficiency building codes is capitalized into housing rents, which are estimated to increase by 23.25 percent with the codes. However, the codes provide households a compensating differential of about a 6.47 percent reduction (about $7.71) in monthly energy expenditure. Results indicate that the mean household net implicit price for these codes is about $140.87 per month in 2006 dollars ($163.19 in 2013 dollars). However, this estimated price is shown to vary significantly by region, energy type and the rent gradient. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Consider the task of tracking the energy use of an entire city while also working to reduce it by 50% in 17 years. How would you go about tracking and verifying such reductions? Further, how would this be accomplished in a city without a database of building-specific characteristics and no energy reporting law? To begin, let's consider what this task would look like for one building. Where to start? Let's try with a performance metric and point of comparison.
   Just as cars gauge performance by MPG, and pitchers by ERA, buildings can use Energy Use Intensity (EUI) as a performance metric. Measured in Energy / ft(2) / year, EUI standardizes energy use per square foot, allowing for comparison between many buildings. EUI is a snapshot of building performance over one year's time. It is relatively easy to calculate a building's EUI if their energy usage is known, but in order to gauge performance over a longer period, a constant comparison point must be established so that evaluation is consistent. Called the baseline, this comparison point can be established as a past year, a future goal, or the average performance of similar buildings.
   This paper covers the work of the Pittsburgh 2030 District team in formulating an energy performance baseline for each building in Downtown Pittsburgh for purposes of tracking energy use reduction towards the 50% reduction goals of The 2030 Challenge. Pittsburgh is a city with a large stock of aging buildings, without mandatory benchmarking laws, and no single publicly accessible real estate profile by property. Thus, the energy baseline methods included in this paper summarize efforts to create such an aggregated property characteristic database and associated energy baseline for Downtown Pittsburgh; it is the hope of the authors that these efforts will assist similar cities in mirroring 2030 District goal setting and achievement for building energy

TI  - Environmental cost and pollution risk caused by the industrial transfer in Qinghai Province
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
AB  - With the rising pressure due to energy consumption and costs of environmental protection and recovery, industrial transfer from the eastern to central and western areas has surged in China. However, extremely fragile ecological conditions and severe water shortage are significant hurdles for industry development in Western China. Whether the vulnerable environment can bear the pollution caused by the transferred industry from Eastern China becomes a significant issue. This study firstly estimates energy and environmental costs in different areas of China, and assesses the necessity to upgrade the industrial structure of Qinghai Province. Then the emissions of waste water, waste gas, and smoke caused by transferred industries are calculated by Input-Output Model. On the basis of the effect analysis of waste emission on environment, pollution risks of Qinghai province are assessed. The results illustrate that the costs of environmental protection and recovery in China have a gradient distribution, of which the energy efficiency is lower while environmental costs are higher in Western China. Industrial structure adjustment has different impacts on the pollution of different sectors. Although the development of machinery and equipment, hotels and catering services, and real estate, leasing, and business services has increased the emission of pollutants, it is offset by the decreasing emissions caused by other industries such as construction and metal products. Therefore, although economic development will increase environmental pollution, industrial adjustments can effectively decrease waste water and waste gas emissions to reduce the pollution risk. It should be noted that there are still tremendous challenges for industrial transfer in Qinghai Province to coordinate the environment and industry development.

TI  - Performance investigation of heat pump-gas fired water heater hybrid system and its economic feasibility study
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - Heat pump water heaters have been introduced to improve energy efficiency of water heating in buildings. Although much research has been conducted to make up for weak points of heat pumps which occur when their purpose is converted from air-conditioning into water heating, there remain some points to be improved to perform as stably as conventional water heaters. Recently, the hybrid water heating system, which is the combination of a heat pump and a traditional gas fired water heater, is proposed as an alternative water heater to perform more efficient water heating stably. In this paper, the hybrid system is designed for general residential houses in Korea, which have floor area of 106.47 m(2) and its performance characteristics are analyzed numerically. To obtain the performance of a hybrid water heating system, the mathematical models of heat pump components and the correlation, which is derived from experimental data of a gas fired water heater, are applied. Also, using the result of a performance calculation, the economic feasibility study is carried out, with the concept of energy cost savings, to quantify the merits of the system and to establish its operation strategy. The monthly electricity and heat consumption data in a Korean residential house and the price of electricity and gas are applied to reflect an actual situation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - THE GREENING OF THE PARKING INDUSTRY -BEST PRACTICES, AND A NEW CERTIFICATION PROGRAM FOR PARKING STRUCTURES
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Sustainable building design is now mainstream. The United States Green Building Council (USGBC) and the LEED Ratings Systems have moved the market, proving that "a rising tide lifts all boats." Consumers now factor environmental effect into their buying decisions, a trend that looks to continue and intensify with the millennial generation. Renters and homeowners are willing to pay more for high-performing and better quality housing based on environmental standards. Companies recognize that indoor air quality and daylighting improve employee performance and boost retention rates. And even bottom-line businesses are investing in benchmarking and efficiency projects that have the right return on investment rates. The Urban Land Institute's Greenprint Center for Building Performance serves as a prime example of the ways developers implement benchmarking, energy efficiency, and high-performance standards in the major real estate sectors: office, retail, industrial, multifamily, and hotel.
   Energy efficiency gains and higher-quality buildings in each of these sectors will be essential to reducing emissions and energy use. While the transportation sector implements its own standards and benchmarking tools to achieve greater levels of sustainability across all modes of transportation, one industry that stands at the nexus of every building type and the transportation modes used to access them is parking.
   There is a key consideration that links land use and transportation: Parking is often the connection between where we are and where we want to go. Parking may not have been at the forefront of the sustainability discussion or the media surrounding it in previous years, but the professionals who work in the world of parking know exactly how important the role of their industry is to the success of our cities, towns, institutions, and businesses. Parking is big business; it is conservatively estimated to be a $30 billion industry. It directly contributes to the economic vitality and accessibility of where we live, work, and play.

TI  - Energy efficiency retrofits for US housing: Removing the bottlenecks
T2  - REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS
AB  - U.S. housing accounted for over 22% of the country's total primary energy consumption in 2009, which equated to more than $2000 per household and $229 billion in aggregate expenditure. It appears that these amounts could be reduced substantially, with benefits to both household budgets and the environment's well-being. This paper's goal is to evaluate the alternative mechanisms that could expedite energy efficiency retrofits for U.S. housing.
   We begin by evaluating the evidence that significant improvements in the energy efficiency of existing U.S. housing are feasible, both technologically and financially. We compare the relatively optimistic positions taken in McKinsey and Company (2009a,b), EPRI (2009), and Harcourt, Brown, and Carey (2011) versus the less optimistic appraisal in Allcott and Greenstone (2012). We conclude that significant energy savings do appear to be both technologically and financially feasible.
   The remainder of the paper considers the bottlenecks that hamper energy-saving investments for the residential sector. We focus on imperfect information and loan market failures as the two key factors. We evaluate the state of the art with respect to scoring and assessment tools for energy-saving investments and the On-Bill, PACE, and Solar programs to facilitate secured loans. The discussion concludes with a series of proposals to overcome the bottlenecks. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sustaining Our Heritage: The Way Forward for Energy-Efficient Historic Housing Stock
T2  - HISTORIC ENVIRONMENT-POLICY & PRACTICE
AB  - Typically, a historic building consists of what today would be considered traditional features, such as fireplaces and chimney stacks, as well as cellular room plans with high ceilings and draught lobbies which reduce air infiltration and heat loss and increase its thermal mass. Such inherent properties should not be overlooked when considering a historic building's future thermal performance, as they may be able to make a valid contribution to improving its energy efficiency. This paper aims to research the link between conservation principles and sustainable refurbishment schemes, appraising the impact of sustainable technologies on historic dwellings. A key theme of the study is the fine balance to be achieved when managing change in refurbishment projects of heritage value. In addition, recent additions or alterations of less heritage value may still form part of the fabric of historic dwellings and must be managed or rectified so as not to detract from the overall character or functionality of the building. This brings to the forefront the role of conservation principles and guidelines as well as energy-efficiency standards and building regulations, and the effect of governmental policy on piecemeal change, in light of the high level of importance given to the sustainability agenda. Home-owners are given incentives and permitted alteration rights that do not always respect the sensitive character of historic dwellings. Currently, if a building is not listed, then its intrinsic features are not protected. Local planning authorities require clearer guidance on how to reach sustainability targets without compromising the heritage value that makes historic dwellings so unique and distinct to the era to which they belong.

TI  - Economic returns to residential green building investment: The developers' perspective
T2  - REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS
AB  - While many studies have shown that "green price premiums" accompany the development of green buildings, there is still significant doubt among the public as to the financial viability of investments in energy efficiency. In this paper, we examine this issue from the developers' perspective, and draw on data from Singapore's Green Mark (GM) system, which was introduced in 2005 to evaluate the sustainability and energy-efficiency of buildings. We find that the "green price premium" of residential developments arises largely during the resale phase, relative to the presale stage. The market premium of GM-rated units is about 10% at the resale stage, compared to about 4% during the presale stage. This implies that, while developers pay for almost all of the additional costs of energy efficiency during construction, they only share part of the benefits associated with such green investments. We also find no evidence that the development of green housing can immediately and significantly improve the corporate financial performance of Singaporean residential developers. These results provide the first evidence of the mismatch that developers face between outlays and benefits in the residential green building sector. This mismatch may impede further development of green residential properties. The emerging green real estate markets should be encouraged to introduce innovative business arrangements and financial products that allow residential developers to capture the future benefits associated with green properties.

TI  - Exceeding the Ontario Building Code for low-rise residential buildings: Economic and environmental implications
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The residential sector accounts for approximately one fifth of Canada's secondary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, addressing the energy efficiency of residential buildings has a significant role to play in reducing the nation's overall greenhouse gas emissions. The Ontario Building Code has recently been updated to reflect a more stringent energy performance standard. A home built to the prescribed minimum requirements will perform at a relatively high standard with respect to energy use when compared to homes built less than a decade ago. This paper explores three energy efficiency upgrade options which improve upon the energy efficiency of the 2012 Ontario Building Code. The "controlled ventilation" upgrade involved tightening up the building envelope and adding heat recovery to waste air streams, and two additional upgrade options were developed to meet the high performance targets of the R-2000 standard. While the upgrades explored did not show financial benefit for individual homeowners at current utility rates, if the benefits to society are considered, the upgrades are an economically efficient method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions owed to energy consumption. In addition to highlighting the need for a broader approach to the cost-benefit analyses associated with these types of upgrades, this finding also warrants a discussion about how to transform the current housing market so that energy efficient homes are more appropriately valued.

TI  - The capitalization of green labels in the California housing market
T2  - REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS
AB  - The residential sector accounts for 33% of electricity consumption in the U.S., with a total expenditure of $166 billion in 2010. Increasing the energy efficiency of the durable housing stock can thus provide significant cost savings for consumers. One promising trend is the rise of homes labeled by a third party as "green" or energy efficient. This paper documents evidence on the effects of providing information about the energy efficiency and "sustainability" of structures in affecting consumer choice. We conduct a hedonic pricing analysis of all single-family home sales in California over the time period 2007 to 2012, and find that homes labeled with a green label transact at a small premium relative to otherwise comparable, non-labeled homes. We show evidence of spatial variation in this capitalization such that both environmental ideology and local climatic conditions play a role in explaining the variation in the green premium across geographies.

TI  - How many cores do we need to run a parallel workload: A test drive of the Intel SCC platform?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB  - As semiconductor manufacturing technology continues to improve, it is possible to integrate more and more transistors onto a single processor. Many-core processor design has resulted in part from the search to utilize this enormous transistor real estate. The Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC) is an experimental many-core processor created by Intel Labs. In this paper we present a study in which we analyze this innovative many-core system by running several workloads with distinctive parallelism characteristics. We investigate the effect on system performance by monitoring specific hardware performance counters. Then, we experiment on varying different hardware configuration parameters such as number of cores, clock frequency and voltage levels. We execute the chosen workloads and collect the timing, power consumption and energy consumption information on such a many-core research platform. Thus, we can comprehensively analyze the behavior and scalability of the Intel SCC system with the introduced workload in terms of performance and energy consumption. Our results show that the profiled parallel workload execution has a communication bottleneck on the Intel SCC system. Moreover, our results indicate that we should carefully choose the number of cores to execute different workloads in order to yield a balance between execution performance and energy efficiency for different applications.

TI  - Analysis of CO2 emissions in the construction phase of single-family detached houses
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - Within the European Union (EU), the implementation of strategies for smart, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth is a major priority. Sustainable growth is summarized in the following objectives for 2020: (i) 20% reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; (ii) 20% energy consumption from renewable resources; (iii) 20% reduction in EU energy consumption by improving energy efficiency in member states. Within this context, this research analyzes the environmental impact of CO2 emissions in building construction in the following Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) processes: (Al) raw material supply; (A2) transport; (A3) manufacturing; (A4) transport; (A5) construction/installation on-site processes. In the case of a single-family detached house, the value obtained was 385 kg CO2/m(2) of the surface area of this building type. The distribution of these emissions among the construction work units was also obtained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Balancing act: Government roles in an energy conservation network
T2  - RESEARCH POLICY
AB  - Government-led interorganizational alliance networks present a sensible opportunity to overcome many societal challenges through collaborative governance. In particular, few researchers have studied alliance networks in the field of energy conservation in commercial buildings a sector with unique barriers to greater diffusion of innovative cost-saving strategies. We applied an analytic inductive case-based method and social network analysis to study one particular alliance network: the United States Commercial Building Energy Alliances representing interests from retail, commercial real estate, and healthcare sectors. This alliance network was initiated by the United States Department of Energy, with assistance from several federally funded research laboratories in the United States, to promote the diffusion of knowledge and ultimately encourage greater deployment of energy efficiency and clean energy strategies in commercial buildings. We draw upon interview data from 28 cases of private, non-profit, and governmental organizations and complete network data from the alliance participants. We honed in on eight focal cases of governmental organizations to provide insight on how the four forms of energy and environmental data, information, and knowledge shared within an alliance network address the challenge of a vastly underutilized energy resource, namely conservation. Further, we identify and discuss the public's four roles Commissioner, Interpreter, Marketer, and User in providing balance to the diffusion of both private and public goods in a network.

TI  - ENERGY COSTS, RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY, AND SEGREGATION IN A SHRINKING CITY.
T2  - OPEN HOUSE INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In debates related to energy poverty, the link to questions of residential segregation remains somewhat peripheral. Because, usually, only energy-poor households are at the focus and residential mobility is not addressed, the interdependencies between households' energy costs and the residential segregation of cities remain out of sight. Concern that energy efficiency measures could foster socio-spatial segregation in cities has recently emerged in Germany. If only households with higher incomes can afford housing with high energy efficiency standards, whereas low income households tend to choose non-refurbished but, in sum, more affordable housing stock, an increasing concentration of poor households in poor housing conditions would result. German energy efficiency and CO2 reduction policies are relatively insensitive to such questions.
   Using survey data from a small shrinking city in Germany, we explore how energy costs are interrelated with residential location decisions and, thus, with segregation processes and patterns. Shrinking cities represent an interesting case because, here, a decreasing demand for housing stimulates residential mobility and paves the way for dynamic reconfigurations of socio-spatial patterns.
   We found that energy-related aspects of homes play a role in location decisions. Low income households seek to minimize housing costs in general, paying specific attention to heating systems, thermal insulation and costs. Resulting segregation effects depend very much on where affordable and, at the same time, energy-efficient housing stock is spatially concentrated in cities. These findings should be taken into consideration for future policies on energy in existing dwellings.

TI  - Method for Energy Performance Integration in Corporate Public Real Estate Management
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES
CP  - 10th International Conference on Shock and Impact Loads on Structures
AB  - Building-performance assessment is receiving increased attention within the building industry because of the European Union's (EU's) targets to improve energy efficiency and to increase the use of renewable energy technologies. In this context, there is great emphasis placed on the existing building stock as having a huge environmental impact. The continuous assessment of the energy performance of existing buildings comes into focus to ensure the intended performance and operation during the building life cycle. This paper introduces the Energy Performance Integration in Public Corporate Real Estate Management (EPI-CREM) initiative that aims to improve the energy performance and rational use of energy across the public building stock in Europe by embedding energy-saving measures into the existing public corporate real estate management (REM) processes. To this end, EPI-CREM focuses on the integration of energy-improving actions into the long-term maintenance plans of existing buildings. In this paper, the EPI-CREM method and supporting tools are discussed from a functional point of view, followed by an evaluation of the method based on the results of its implementation on pilot buildings in three participating EU countries.

TI  - Influence of absorptance in the building envelope of affordable housing in warm dry climates
T2  - 2013 ISES SOLAR WORLD CONGRESS
CP  - ISES Solar World Congress (SWC)
AB  - In Mexico, as in many other countries, the energy crisis has permeated throughout many sectors, particularly the construction sector. Mexico has started to develop and implement actions for the efficient use of energy in order to reduce its consumption. The field of building construction has been particularly active in studying ways to optimize the use of energy, especially regarding energy use indoors. One of the main goals of architectural design is to create the proper indoor conditions so individuals can carry out their daily activities in a comfortable area. Interior space must be designed and calculated to provide a comfortable temperature, appropriate lighting, sound control and ventilation for individuals to carry out their daily activities, but must also address the energy required to provide all these characteristics. In warm dry climates, air-conditioning is responsible for a significant amount of the energy consumed in buildings. Proper building design is necessary in order to reduce energy consumption in this sector. This paper shows the results of simulations with the Energy Plus software to compare the thermal performance of a low-cost housing located in a warm dry climate, Hermosillo, Sonora, with similar construction systems in the envelope. Furthermore, an analysis of the effect of the color exterior finish, represented as a gradual change in the absorptance to solar radiation. The simulation is performed for two conditions of use of low-cost housing, the first condition considers the room without air conditioning and the second considers the air conditioned room. To simulate analyzed housing with air conditioning, is used an air conditioner from the database Energy Plus, corresponding to a Mini-split system compact unit zone cooling with a COP (Coefficient of performance) of 1.83.

AB  - The problem of the efficient management of energy is very important, not only to individual real estate owners, but also to city authorities. Building blocks, districts or the entire organism of a city require the development of various planning documents cultural value analyses, integrated urban planning and even energy optimization plans for each district within a city. It is possible to achieve varying economic and aesthetic effects that generate different costs, at the same time having a differing impact on the quality of a city's public spaces. The urban revitalization of city districts should not come down to the aesthetic layer only, but should also include an improvement in energy efficiency standards, the lowering of building maintenance costs and an overall increase in quality of life, especially within historical districts.

AB  - 3D-ICs based on TSV technology provide high bandwidth inter-chip connections. The drawback is that most of the existing TSVs consume a large amount of silicon real estate. We present circuit-level design and analysis of area efficient, low power, high-data-rate 3D serial TSV links. A design space exploration is performed and trade-offs in terms of area, power and performance are presented. Circuit simulations of RC-extracted layouts in 40nm CMOS-technology reveals that 8: 1 serialization efficiently balances area consumption and energy efficiency. Using 10 mu m-diameter TSV technology, an 8Gb/s serial link consumes only 84fJ/bit with 10X area reduction over 8b parallel bus.

CP  - International Conference on Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering (ICMSME 2013)
AB  - Purpose - to ensure sustainable development of the territory and incentives to increase the "green" building by improving the competitiveness of the buildings that have higher environmental and economic performance at all stages of the life cycle. A systematic analysis of standards of "green" building and the existing methodologies for life cycle assessment back. Developed and studied environmental-economic model of the life cycle of the building effectively, by identifying and organizing the quantitative and qualitative characteristics and to calculate the total cost of the building. These issues are discussed in this article.
   Relevance of the topic. Buildings are used around the world about 40% of the primary energy consumption, 67% of all electricity, 40% of the total raw material and 14% of potable water, and produce 35% of carbon dioxide and about half of all municipal solid waste.
   If the entire area of the urban area of the Earth in 1980 was 4.69 mln.km2, it is projected in 2070 it will reach 19 mln.km2, or 12.8% of the total and more than 20% of the land area liveable. Russia, in spite of a significant area of its total land area is highly urbanized state where urban and peri-urban population of 109 million people, or 74% of the total population. The trend of increasing urban population persists because of political, social, economic and other reasons.
   For the vast majority of modern cities is an urgent problem crudely-designed urban spaces, poor-quality housing and facilities - poor lighting and ventilation, expensive maintenance and high energy consumption, poor landscaping, ill-conceived transport infrastructure as a result of water pollution of rivers, huge unorganized garbage dumps, decline of biological diversity, the burning of fossil fuels - is only a small part of the illiterate urban policy.
   The tasks that need to be addressed to achieve the goal
   justification of "green" building, as an effective tool for sustainable development of the territory on which the construction site is located;
   identify the benefits of certification of buildings and structures in accordance with "green" standards for investors, property owners, developers, designers and management companies, as well as for the environment, human health and society;
   exploration and development of international rating systems for the assessment of objects "green" building, the informational approach to the design and construction of buildings on the basis of the methodology of life cycle assessment;
   development of environmental-economic model of the life cycle performance of buildings, taking into account the total cost, determined by quantitative and qualitative indicators and characteristics of "green" building;
   study of ecological and economic model of the life cycle of the building, and writing effective algorithm for calculating the present value of owning an apartment building with the introduction of a score of "green" building - the coefficient of "greenness";
   development of guidelines on the use of environmental-economic model for the State Corporation - Assistance Foundation and the reform of public utilities;
   testing and implementation of the model on real construction sites.

TI  - Collaborative Research and Education in the Design and Building of a Net-Zero Energy Solar Powered House - Testimony of a Solar Decathlon 2013 Entry
T2  - 2014 ASEE INTERNATIONAL FORUM
CP  - ASEE International Forum
AB  - This paper provides a testimony of the experience and the lessons learned during the design, construction and presentation of a net-zero energy house as part of the 2013 U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) Solar Decathlon competition. The Solar Decathlon is a biennial competition which challenges international collegiate teams to design, build, and operate net-zero energy solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive. Like the Olympic Decathlon, the Solar Decathlon consists of 10 contests: juried contests (engineering, architecture, market appeal, communications and affordability) and measured contests (comfort zone, hot water, appliances, home entertainment and energy balance). The purpose of the competition is both educative - educational experience for the participating students, for the general public, for the building industry and the policy makers - and research oriented - encouraging multi-disciplinary collaboration towards development of new technologies and methods.
   The paper discusses the educational experience of the students participating in this international competition, focusing on the engineering undergraduate students. It describes the plan implemented for integrating the Solar Decathlon into the required curricula within the engineering, architecture, and business departments. A project as large and diverse as this one required accommodating curricular development at various levels and within various modes of teaching and learning. Students were encouraged to participate in the process in five ways: design studios, research labs and seminars, special topics, construction, and monitoring. Although the greatest learning experience for the students occurred in the integrated design process - across engineering disciplines, and school of architecture - the student team members also learned how to raise funds, procure materials and construction equipment, and how to interact with one another towards a mutual goal.
   The project provided an opportunity for the development and implementation of new educational materials focused on energy efficiency, sustainable building design, solar energy, and power conversion and conditioning technologies. Being part of a large and varied team seeing a project from the preliminary design phase to construction and commissioning, the students were provided with a true multi-disciplinary hands-on opportunity. The opportunity proved to strengthen their technical skills, acquired in the regular curriculum, via integration of theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Moreover, the students were exposed to the perspective and educational styles of professors and students in each represented academic department (electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, architecture, marketing and communications). Organized in a multi-disciplinary format, students were then able to share their strengths across disciplines and contribute to a synthesis of process and product.

TI  - Supply, Demand and the Value of Green Buildings
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
AB  - Attention to sustainability' and energy efficiency rating schemes in the commercial property sector has increased rapidly during the past decade. In the UK, commercial properties have been certified under the BREEAM rating scheme since 1999, offering fertile ground to investigate the economic dynamics of green' certification in the commercial property market. This paper documents that, over the 2000-09 period, the expanding supply of green buildings within a given London neighbourhood had a positive impact on average rents and prices, but reduced rents and prices for environmentally certified real estate. The results suggest that there is a gentrification effect from green buildings. However, each additional green building decreases the marginal effect of certification in the rental and transaction markets by 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. In addition, controlling for lease contract features, like contract length and the rent-free period, modifies the impact of environmental certification on rental prices.

TI  - Life cycle cost analysis of the UK housing stock
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB  - The aim of the paper is to estimate life cycle costs (LCC) of the current housing stock in the UK as part of sustainability assessment of the residential construction sector. This is carried out by first estimating the life cycle costs of individual houses considering detached, semi-detached and terraced homes. These results are then extrapolated to the UK housing stock consisting of seven million each of semi-detached and terraced houses and four million of detached houses. A brief discussion of life cycle environmental impacts is also included to help identify improvement opportunities for both costs and impacts.
   The life cycle costing methodology followed in the study is congruent with the life cycle assessment methodology. The system boundary for the study is from 'cradle to grave', including all activities from extraction and manufacture of construction materials to construction and use of the house to its demolition. The functional unit is defined as the construction and occupation of a house in the UK over the lifetime of 50 years.
   The total life cycle costs are estimated at A 247,000 pound for the detached house, A 192,000 pound for the semi-detached and A 142,000 pound for the terraced house. The running costs in the use stage contribute 52 % to the total life cycle costs of which half is from energy use. The construction costs contribute 35 % to the total LCC with the walls and the roof being the most expensive items. The remaining 13 % of the costs are incurred at the end of life of the house which are largely (85 %) due to the cost of labour for demolition. Recovery of end-of-life materials has a limited potential to reduce the overall life cycle costs of a house. The life cycle costs of the whole housing stock are estimated at A 67 pound billion per year or A 3,360 pound billion over the 50-year lifetime.
   The existing housing stock in the UK is facing a number of challenges that will need to be addressed in the near future. These include improving energy efficiency and reducing the dependency on fossil fuels to reduce energy demand, fuel poverty and environmental impacts. Furthermore, the disparity between the construction costs and house market prices will need to be addressed to ensure that access to housing and house ownership do not become the privilege of a few.

TI  - Determinants of green building adoption
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN
AB  - In this paper we investigate variations in the adoption of LEED-certified commercial buildings across 174 core-based statistical areas in the United States. Drawing upon a unique database and using a robust analytical framework, the determinants of the proportion LEED-certified space are modeled. We find that, despite high growth rates, LEED-certified stock accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total commercial stock. The average proportion is less than 1%. A further contribution of the paper is that our concentration measure avoids the biases associated with simple percentage measures that were used in previous studies of this topic. Strongest predictors of the proportion of LEED-certified commercial space in a local market are market size, educational attainment and economic growth. In terms of policy effectiveness, it is found that only a mandatory requirement to obtain LEED certification for new buildings has a significant positive effect on market penetration.

TI  - Deploy energy-efficient technologies in the restoration of a traditional building in the historical center of Catania (Italy).
T2  - 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABILITY IN ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
CP  - 6th International Conference on Sustainability in Energy and Buildings (SEB)
AB  - The policy about energy efficiency of buildings, including minimum energy requirements and energy performance certificate (EPC), have to be also applied to existing buildings in the case of energy retrofit. In this paper, the possible strategies that can be used to reduce the energy needs of traditional massive buildings, that are widespread in the old town of the Mediterranean cities, have been investigated. To this aim, this study evaluates the energy consumption of a massive building placed in Catania city, called "La Casa del Portuale", which was recently refurbished with the aim to host two local administrative centers. The energy needs of this building was evaluated through computer simulation both in the heating and cooling period, on a yearly basis. The activities research were developed analyzing different refurbishment solutions suitable to improve the thermal performance of most traditional buildings without adversely affecting their fabric and character. Therefore, the feasibility comparison has been performed between the examined refurbishment solutions. The results of the proposed research, considering the diffusion of this typology of buildings, could be assumed as reference to a significant portion of the traditional real estate.

TI  - Heat supply of multi-apartment buildings with varied heat demands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED ENERGY, ICAE2014
CP  - 6th International Conference on Applied Energy (ICAE)
AB  - In multi-apartment buildings, changes in energy demand may influence cost-optimal heat supply options. District heat based on combined heat and power production has proved to be cost-and primary energy-efficient option for heating purposes in the residential sector. However, for customers with a low heat demand, local heat supply options may be more cost-efficient than district heat supply options. In this study, we investigated cost-optimal options to supply heat to a multi-apartment building in Vaxjo city, Sweden. We considered biomass-based alternatives for district heating and local heating based on wood pellet boiler and ground-source electric heat pump, also combined with solar heating systems. Furthermore, we evaluated how a varied yearly heat demand influences the cost and primary energy efficiency of the different heat technologies. We found that both fuel costs and initial investment costs of heating systems play an important role for the cost efficiency of the different heat supply options. District heat is not always cost efficient for multi-apartment buildings especially for low energy buildings with minimum heat demand. There is also a tradeoff between heating cost and primary energy use in supplying heat to multi-apartment buildings. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - TOWARD BUILDING KNOWLEDGE FOR SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE TRANSITION OF THE BUILDING STOCK
T2  - GEOCONFERENCE ON NANO, BIO AND GREEN - TECHNOLOGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE, VOL II (SGEM 2014)
CP  - 14th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM)
AB  - The paper discusses the possibility of developing an easy and shareable framework with the aim of building basic knowledge for supporting the energy retrofitting process of the heritage building stock, with spatial detail at the neighborhood or district scale and, in a more general sense, for supporting the urban regeneration process.
   One of the main strategies to achieve the 20-20-20 Communitarian objectives is the building stock renovation process via energy efficiency improvement. Thanks to the great economical and political interest in the development of technologies and practices for reducing energy consumption and for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) micro-generation, there are favorable conditions to reach the resources to promote a rethinking of the physical components and intangible assets of the cities. The integration of new technologies into the urban building stock could pave the way for urban regeneration with small scale intervention programs that combine the identity of the places with energy efficiency and urban facilities improvement.
   In order to support this extraordinarily complex process, the Public Administrations (PA) and decision makers need methodologies and tools capable of defining and representing urban transformation scenarios and future views in order to encourage the broad participation of strategies drawing and promote the sharing and transfer of good practices. Tools and models adopt methodologies and approaches of various complexities, purposes and effectiveness. Generally speaking, the specificity of the models often focused only on certain aspects of the process (CO2 emissions, RES potential, Microclimate, Policy assessment.), and the various local baseline data availability on the utilization and physical characteristics of the real estate and on energy consumption require use of methods that are unlikely could be exported to different contexts.
   The wide implementation of INSPIRE standards for the management and production of spatial data, the spread of new technologies for topographic high detail surveying and for the production of environmental data outline an approach that could be exported in a different context, such as a way to create a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) to describe the state of the urban environment. At the same time, the promising SMART metering technologies and the development of methodologies for voluntary feedback acquisition from energy users, or more widely from city users, could overcome the chronic lack of data about energy consumption profiles.
   However, some barriers still remain, preventing the development of a widely shared approach which are the further research focus.

TI  - Unequal access to energy efficiency in US multifamily rental housing: opportunities to improve
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - The energy efficiency of US multifamily rental housing is compared with other housing types. A real and growing energy efficiency gap is documented, particularly for lower income households. Findings are based on data from the 2005 and 2009 US Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). Individual energy efficiency features related to HVAC (heating, ventilation and cooling) systems, appliances, and the building envelope are analysed along with weighted and unweighted total energy efficiency indices. Multifamily units occupied by low income renters had 4.1 fewer energy efficiency features in 2005 and 4.7 fewer in 2009 compared with other households. If the number of efficiency features was on par with other housing, the savings could be in the range of US$200-400 per year for most lower-income renters in multifamily buildings. There is an astonishing lack of information on how efficiency retrofits would affect property (real estate) metrics such as cash flow and value. Available evidence suggests that millions of US properties could be good retrofit investment opportunities. Better efficiency would allow renters to increase spending on food, healthcare and other essentials. This is not only an economic issue: it has implications for household health, social equity and environmental problems tied to energy consumption.

TI  - ROMANIAN MULTISTOREY APARTMENT BUILDINGS - BETWEEN RETROFITTING AND RENOVATION
T2  - GEOCONFERENCE ON NANO, BIO AND GREEN - TECHNOLOGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE, VOL II (SGEM 2014)
CP  - 14th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM)
AB  - During the urban development of the communist era in the 1970s, entire neighborhoods of collective dwellings were erected in order to accommodate the wave of people working in the new factories. Standardized and repeated blocks of flats were massively spread throughout the country, offering identical living conditions for all their inhabitants. After the fall of the totalitarian regime, 96% of the inhabitants living in the blocks of flats became owners of their apartments, one of the highest rates of ownership in Europe. Nowadays, almost 60% of the Romanian urban population lives in these so-called grey neighborhoods.
   The renovation of these buildings started in the middle of the 90's, as a response to their technical degrading. Most common interventions resulted in the addition of pitched-roofs over the deteriorated flat roofs in order to prevent infiltrations. The real estate development from the 2000s treated the so-called thermal rehabilitation program into a business opportunity by using the slope roof as a livable attic connected to the existing block. As a result, new apartments were added, increasing the urban density levels, but without offering a significant improvement for the existing inhabitants.
   The existing Thermal rehabilitation program consists in cladding the facade with a polystyrene base thermal envelope system, and, in some cases, the replacement of the openings with efficient doors and windows. In this case the reduction in energy demands is of 30-40%. The plumbing and heating systems are not included therefore energy management systems are not present.
   By contrast, sustainable retrofitting embodies an integrated approach concerning social, economic and environmental aspects. The present article describes the detailed aspects of the two directions of intervening on this specific Romanian building stock. Multiplication represents an advantage for the implementing of both measures (almost 40.000 blocks of flats exist in Romania). The market viability of the two types of intervention is translated in two different industrialization processes detailed in this paper.

TI  - Key factors determining the energy rating of existing English houses
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - In the UK, the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) is used to rate the energy performance of existing dwellings whenever they are let or sold. This study investigates which of the inputs to SAP account for the most variance in energy rating across existing gas central heated houses in England. Data from the English Housing Survey (EHS) 2009 are used to generate a representative set of dwellings and variance-based global sensitivity analysis is then applied to assess each input's contribution to the variance in the calculated ratings. It is demonstrated that heating system efficiency, external wall U-value and dwelling geometry account for 75% of the variance of the energy rating of gas central heated houses in England. This suggests that improving heating system efficiencies and wall U-values of the worst performing dwellings will go a long way towards improving their energy rating and potentially reducing their energy consumption. It is also demonstrated that dwelling geometry has a much bigger influence on the calculated carbon emissions (accounting for 80% of the variance) than it does on the SAP energy rating (accounting for 30%), meaning that significant improvements in energy rating might not be accompanied by significant reductions in carbon emissions.

TI  - Prospects for West German Post-War Single-Family Home Neighbourhoods Revitalising Housing Stocks as a New Policy Field for Suburban and Rural Municipalities
T2  - COMPARATIVE POPULATION STUDIES
AB  - The single-family home neighbourhoods that were built in West Germany in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s will be increasingly affected by future socio-demographic changes. Today, the above-average length of occupancy by owners and the rise in life expectancy are leading to the increased over-ageing of the populations in these residential areas. The generational change means that a constantly growing number of these homes are being put up for sale and encountering a changing and regionally differentiated housing market. Regionally diverse shrinking and ageing of the population will decrease the potential demand for single-family homes in coming years. In addition, social change will lead to qualitative changes in demand. The pluralisation of living arrangements and residential preferences can be expressed in the changed household structures and the geographic shift in housing demand in favour of more dense urban areas. Therefore, residential areas in peripheral regions with unfavourable demographic and economic conditions are particularly at risk. At the local level, winners and losers will emerge among the existing residential neighbourhoods of suburban or rural municipalities. Disadvantages such as unfavourable characteristics of a certain location and construction or energy efficiency shortcomings, as well as image perception, can combine to create serious problems. In the worst case, homes are at risk of a loss in value, neglect, vacancy and dilapidation developments that have, to date, been largely unknown in Germany's single-family home sector. The question for areas with at-risk homes is how the looming change in owner generations, not to mention the structural and infrastructural transformation processes, can be managed. This article, based on the results of a research project conducted by the WESTENROT Foundation, examines the general demographic and socio-economic causes of this development and characterises the present situation in selected case studies. We also address questions about handling these problems and identify initial considerations about possible municipal interventions in the revitalisation of single-family home neighbourhoods. In addition, the article presents a strategic framework for action and a number of possible municipal provisions.

CP  - International Conference on Materials Science, Machinery and Energy Engineering (MSMEE 2013)
AB  - New housing completions constitute a considerable share of the overall housing supply in China's current urban housing markets. We argue that large-scale new housing developments significantly increase energy consumption in the long run, thereby increasing energy prices. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of supply-side housing variables rather than demand-side housing variables on energy prices in Beijing. Supply-side housing variables include level variable (floor space) and growth variable (changes in floor space). We investigated their respective effects on energy prices. We tested for cointegration, Granger causality and weak exogeneity. Tests indicated that new housing completions exerted a positive long-term effect on energy prices. Hence, new housing development needs to improve energy efficiency.

TI  - Environment-adjusted total-factor energy efficiency of Taiwan's service sectors
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This study computes the pure technical efficiency (PTE) and energy-saving target of Taiwan's service sectors during 2001-2008 by using the input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with the assumption of a variable returns-to-scale (VRS) situation. This paper further investigates the effects of industry characteristics on the energy-saving target by applying the four-stage DEA proposed by Fried et al. (1999). We also calculate the pre-adjusted and environment-adjusted total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores in these service sectors. There are three inputs (labor, capital stock, and energy consumption) and a single output (real GDP) in the DEA model. The most energy efficient service sector is finance, insurance and real estate, which has an average TFEE of 0.994 and an environment-adjusted TFEE (EATFEE) of 0.807. The study utilizes the panel-data, random-effects Tobit regression model with the energy-saving target (EST) as the dependent variable. Those service industries with a larger GDP output have greater excess use of energy. The capital-labor ratio has a significantly positive effect while the time trend variable has a significantly negative impact on the EST, suggesting that future new capital investment should also be accompanied with energy-saving technology in the service sectors.

TI  - How households in Pakistan take on energy efficient lighting technology
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - A household survey in Pakistan is used to examine drivers of more efficient compact fluorescent light bulb (CFL) adoption and the impact of CFL adoption on the demand for lighting services. Higher price of a CFL to an incandescent bulb (IB) and limited knowledge about the life span of CFLs versus IBs are found to lower adoption rates by as much as 20%. While CFL adoption increases the technical efficiency of household lighting, the lower cost for lighting services results in estimated rebound effects that decrease potential energy savings by 23% to 35% due to increased brightness and extended hours of use. These findings have important implications for household welfare and cost-benefit tradeoffs for CFL projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Following the transposition of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive into Irish law, all properties offered for sale or to let in Ireland are obliged to have an energy efficiency rating. This paper analyses the effect of energy efficiency ratings on the sale and rental prices of properties in the Republic of Ireland. Using the Heckman selection technique we model the decision to advertise the energy efficiency rating of a property and the effect of energy efficiency ratings on property values. Our results show that energy efficiency has a positive effect on both the sales and rental prices of properties, and that the effect is significantly stronger in the sales segment of the property market. We also analyse the effect of energy efficiency across different market conditions and we find that the effect of the energy rating is generally stronger where market conditions are worse.

TI  - Dedicating new real estate transfer taxes for energy efficiency: A revenue option for scaling up Green Retrofit Programs
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - As the labor market in the U.S. remains weak, with high unemployment and sluggish job growth, policymakers at various levels of government are looking for new ways to support job growth and investment during an increasingly tight fiscal climate. Policies that promote the "Green Economy" in general and energy efficiency in particular remain politically popular as potential win-win solutions that will create jobs and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, efforts to promote energy efficiency in the residential sector through rebates and incentives alone have yet to reach critical mass. This paper outlines a policy option for state and local governments to use real estate transfer taxes to generate stronger incentives for home buyers to undertake significant retrofit projects at the time of sale. The economic impact of the proposed energy efficiency transfer tax (EETT) is then modeled for the State of North Carolina, using standard input-output techniques. Ultimately, based on housing sales figures from 2010, a new EETT of 2.5 percent on home purchases would generate a net positive increase of approximately 3485 direct construction jobs and 5900 annually total jobs for the state.

TI  - Planning a Regional Energy System in Association with the Creation of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), Statistical Analysis and Energy Efficiency Measures: An Italian Case Study
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - Directive 2002/91/EC EPBD introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) as a tool to guide the real estate market in the creation of products (buildings) with improved energy performances. The EPC's information could be useful in the determination of relevant policies and also in studying the characteristics of the building resources of the territory. This paper presents a case study related to the EPC Database of the Emilia-Romagna Region in mid-northern Italy. The case study shows a way of elaborating the EPC information in statistical analysis evaluations with aggregate data, in order to measure a territory and then direct energy policies toward energy efficiency. A statistical approach was used to define a characteristic statistical indicator index of the EPC database, and compare the energy index with the bottom-up and top-down methods, in order to identify some energy policy scenarios.

TI  - Are There Realistic Possibilities for a Higher "Batting" Average? On Improving Residential Energy Efficiency in Canada
T2  - CANADIAN PUBLIC POLICY-ANALYSE DE POLITIQUES
AB  - The main use of energy in the residential sector in Canada is for space heating. Reductions in residential energy use, therefore, are likely to be achieved primarily through energy-saving retrofits, such as improved insulation. Reasons advanced to explain the foot-dragging of the residential sector in this regard are examined here, along with various policy options. Canadian survey data from 2003 are used to examine and compare the most energy-inefficient households who saw no need for retrofits with other households who provided a similar response, with a view to assessing whether there are factors that can be exploited to increase the uptake of such retrofits. The results suggest there is likely to be no quick fix. In the absence of large retrofit subsidies, with their accompanying free-rider problem, or a multi-pronged strategy that includes a whole array of policy instruments, including one that changes the relative importance of energy costs in household budgets, the outlook for sizeable improvements in residential energy efficiency in Canada via residential retrofits does not appear to be overly promising.

TI  - Energy benchmarking of commercial buildings: a low-cost pathway toward urban sustainability
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - US cities are beginning to experiment with a regulatory approach to address information failures in the real estate market by mandating the energy benchmarking of commercial buildings. Understanding how a commercial building uses energy has many benefits; for example, it helps building owners and tenants identify poor-performing buildings and subsystems and it enables high-performing buildings to achieve greater occupancy rates, rents, and property values. This paper estimates the possible impacts of a national energy benchmarking mandate through analysis chiefly utilizing the Georgia Tech version of the National Energy Modeling System (GT-NEMS). Correcting input discount rates results in a 4.0% reduction in projected energy consumption for seven major classes of equipment relative to the reference case forecast in 2020, rising to 8.7% in 2035. Thus, the official US energy forecasts appear to overestimate future energy consumption by underestimating investments in energy-efficient equipment. Further discount rate reductions spurred by benchmarking policies yield another 1.3-1.4% in energy savings in 2020, increasing to 2.2-2.4% in 2035. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions, and conventional air pollution. Achieving comparable CO2 savings would require more than tripling existing US solar capacity. Our analysis suggests that nearly 90% of the energy saved by a national benchmarking policy would benefit metropolitan areas, and the policy's benefits would outweigh its costs, both to the private sector and society broadly.

TI  - Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings of the Lombardy Region (Italy), a Case Study of High-Energy Performance Buildings
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - The topic of nearly zero-energy buildings (n-ZEB), introduced by the Directive 2010/31/EU will direct the building market toward ever greater energy efficiency of new buildings. In some contexts, however, the building market for high-efficiency buildings has evolved, in recent years, on the basis of national and regional laws that have contributed to the acceleration of the process. This paper analyses the case study of the Lombardy Region (Italy), which transposed and assimilated the Directive 91/2002 (Energy Performance Building Directive), as of 2006, with regional legislation for energy efficiency of buildings. Within a few years the market for high energy-performance of buildings in the Lombardy Region had grown substantially: to date nearly 7500 energy performance certificates for buildings of Class A and Class A+ have been issued. The paper therefore analyses a success story in what is a field of great current interest, namely n-ZEB buildings. In the first part of the work, the evolution in terms of energy efficiency of the housing market in the Lombardy Region has been analyzed, with particular reference to the high energy-performance of buildings. The second part focuses on a sample of 20 n-ZEB buildings in order to highlight the design choices applied to them.

TI  - Energy retrofit of commercial buildings: case study and applied methodology
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - Commercial buildings are responsible for a significant share of the energy requirements of European Union countries. Related consumptions due to heating, cooling, and lighting appear, in most cases, very high and expensive. Since the real estate is renewed with a very small percentage each year and current trends suggest reusing the old structures, strategies for improving energy efficiency and sustainability should focus not only on new buildings, but also and especially on existing ones. Architectural renovation of existing buildings could provide an opportunity to enhance their energy efficiency, by working on the improvement of envelopes and energy supply systems. It has also to be noted that the measures aimed to improve the energy performance of buildings should pay particular attention to the cost-effectiveness of the interventions. In general, there is a lack of well-established methods for retrofitting, but if a case study achieves effective results, the adopted strategies and methodologies can be successfully replicated for similar kinds of buildings. In this paper, an iterative methodology for energy retrofit of commercial buildings is presented, together with a specific application on an existing office building. The case study is particularly significant as it is placed in an urban climatic context characterized by cold winters and hot summers; consequently, HVAC energy consumption is considerable throughout the year. The analysis and simulations of energy performance before and after the intervention, along with measured data on real energy performance, demonstrate the validity of the applied approach. The specifically developed design and refurbishment methodology, presented in this work, could be also assumed as a reference in similar operations.

TI  - The value of basic building code insulation
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - We take advantage of unusually wide variation in thermal insulation in a sample of house sales to estimate the market value of basic code-level insulation. Insulation levels vary across the houses in our sample because standard practice in New Zealand was to build houses with no thermal insulation prior to implementation of insulation standards in 1978, and the extent of insulation retrofits varies across the sample. The estimated premium on an otherwise similar house insulated to code levels exceeds the cost of installation at construction: insulating to basic code levels at construction passes the market test. The premium instead reflects the higher cost of retro-fit installation. We suspect that price, cost, and performance risk have discouraged widespread code-level retro-fits in this market.

TI  - Energy efficiency in the German residential sector: A bottom-up building-stock-model-based analysis in the context of energy-political targets
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This paper assesses the practicability of meeting the German federal government's energy-political targets for the residential sector by analysing the potential future development of this sector in an aggregated bottom-up model. The domestic building stock is considered in terms of the likely developments in the housing market, as well as the energetic characteristics of current and future buildings. The employed method is based on deterministic projections of demand floor space and demolition/refurbishment rates. The key novelty lies in the focus on developments in this sector in Germany; existing studies have not had this focus and have therefore employed a more rudimentary methodology, for example with static refurbishment rates, shorter time horizons or no spatial differentiation. The total resulting final heating demand of domestic buildings of about 500 TWh lies above that of other studies in 2050, which is mainly due to the conservative assumptions regarding renovation activity and new build made in the present case. Hence in the reference scenario the target for 2020 is not met, suggesting that further political intervention is required. In another scenario, it is shown that a drastic increase of the renovation rate is required in order to meet the 2020 target, especially amongst existing single family buildings. The supply side is only indirectly considered due to the aggregated nature of the model, which could be improved for further work, but the presented method nevertheless represents a good compromise between using solely freely available data and obtaining superior degree of precision to previous studies.

TI  - Achieving Cost Benefits in Sustainable Cooperative Housing
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - The cooperative housing sector is directed at low and medium income residents who cannot afford to buy their homes in the regular private market. Due to social housing legislation, it is possible to build cooperative housing below regular market costs and use tax benefits, therefore providing affordable dwellings to their owners. Traditional cooperative housing used to provide less comfort and higher running costs in indoor and domestic hot water heating than in standard construction. However, cooperative housing has started to change its method of traditional construction towards sustainable construction, in order to benefit from the savings on energy consumption and domestic water as well as to provide an improvement as far as the comfort of its residents is concerned. Therefore, in this article, the savings in electricity and natural gas in different building settlements, calculated for Madalena building-sustainable construction-and for Azenha de Cima building-traditional construction-will be presented, according to two different criteria of calculation: efficiency of dwellings at a pre-determined standard level of indoor comfort opposed to real consumptions made by residents. For each building under analysis, an energy audit and further monitoring were brought in, in order to issue an energy evaluation according to the Portuguese energy agency rules. Results showed an expected decrease of the operational costs of natural gas and electricity, obtained by the use of efficient building systems and equipment, as well as a decrease of the payback period for each situation.

TI  - Bridging the Energy Efficiency Gap: A Field Experiment on Lifetime Energy Costs and Household Appliances
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER POLICY
AB  - Providing consumers with information that can lead to more energy-efficient choices can help reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions while reducing costs to consumers. A natural field experiment is conducted in collaboration with an electrical retailer to test strategies for influencing sales of household appliances. The experiment involves two product categories, fridge-freezers and tumble driers. Information on lifetime energy cost of appliances is provided through a label and training of sales staff. For fridge-freezers, the authors find no significant effects. For tumble driers, the combined treatment and training treatment reduce average energy use of tumble driers sold by 4.9% and 3.4%, respectively. The effect is strongest initially, over 12% on average for the first 3 months for the combined treatment but declines over time. The effect is significant at the 5% level for the combined treatment while not significant for sales staff training.

TI  - The Eco-Refurbishment of a 19th Century Terraced House: Energy and Cost Performance for Current and Future UK Climates
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - The UK government, responding to concerns over climate change impacts, has undertaken to reduce CO2 emissions to 80% of 1990 levels by 2050. This scale of reduction will require major improvements in the energy efficiency of the existing UK building stock, which is the dominant consumer of fossil fuel-generated energy. Housing is a key sector, and since 70% of all current homes in the UK will still exist in 2050 then low carbon refurbishment is critical if CO2 reduction goals are to be met. This paper uses computer modeling to examine the annual operational energy performance, long term energy cost savings and internal thermal conditions for a 19th century terraced house that was eco-refurbished to near a Passivhaus standard. The dwelling was modeled for three locations (Edinburgh, Manchester and London) using current and future climate scenarios (2020s and 2050s under high carbon emission scenarios). Simulation results suggest that there would be very little diminution in heating demand in the future for the house with no refurbishment, whilst the eco-refurbishment produced a significant reduction in energy demand and CO2 emissions. Analysis of the payback period and net present value indicate that the economic optimum varies according to energy prices and that the high construction costs incurred for an eco-refurbishment to a near Passivhaus standard could not be justified in terms of a cost/benefit analysis.

TI  - Is energy performance capitalized in office building appraisals?
T2  - PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - Since 2009, all commercial buildings in Sweden should have undergone an energy performance rating in accordance with the European Union directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings. The main purpose of this rating is to illustrate a building's energy performance in an easy, straightforward manner. In doing so, it becomes easier for the actors on the real estate market to assess the building's energy performance, which in the end should be reflected in the capital value of the property. The aim of this paper is to study the EU Energy Performance Certificates' impact on office buildings' capital values.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this paper an econometric approach is used to estimate the energy performance impact on buildings' capital values. A panel data set was constructed using economic data from IPD Nordic and Energy Performance Certificates from the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning.
   Findings - This study shows that a building's energy performance has no impact on its capital value.
   Research limitations/implications - There may be a selection bias in the sample as the study is dependent on data from IPD Nordic.
   Originality/value - This is one of the first papers that study the EU Energy Performance Certificates' impact on office buildings' capital values in Sweden.

TI  - Rental price and sustainability ratings: which sustainability criteria are really paying back?
T2  - CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Given the centrality of the price mechanism to resource allocation in market economies, the effect of sustainable construction on real estate prices has become an increasingly important empirical issue for market participants and policy makers in the real estate sector. Drawing upon a sample of approximately 2500 residential building units in Switzerland, this study assesses the effects of buildings' sustainability on their rental prices. In contrast to the vast majority of previous studies that have focused on the price effects of ecolabels, this study investigates the effects of individual sustainability attributes. Overall, we find a positive relationship between the environmental performance of residential buildings and their rental levels. Sustainable building characteristics, especially those which enhance the water efficiency, the health and comfort level and the building's safety and security, have significant positive price effects. It is argued that the unexpected negative relationship between energy performance and rental prices is attributed to the bundling of energy costs and rents in Swiss lease structures.

TI  - STATION POINTE GREENS-THE JOURNEY TO NET ZERO AFFORDABLE HOUSING
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Station Pointe Greens, a proposed 219-unit residential and commercial development, promises to be one of the most leading edge Passive House Certified Developments in North America. However, an innovative project such as this requires much time and research, and this project being no exception, it is still in its research and design phase. Its story began in 2008 when the City of Edmonton issued a request for proposals from developers regarding improvement of a brownfield site in Belvedere. This was done as part of the City's redevelopment initiative for an area which was in dire need of revitalization. The Communitas Group saw a huge opportunity to develop a large-scale multi-family project immediately adjacent to a light rail transit and bus hub. And so the vision of an affordable and sustainable housing project began to take shape. Communitas had already tested the 'green' construction waters on previous projects, most notably Grandin Green, a 15-storey high-rise which was the first Canadian project to qualify for the Federal CBIP grant (25% more energy efficient than required by the Model National Energy Code for Buildings). However, they had never attempted anything as bold and leading edge as Station Pointe Greens. Their goal from the outset was to build one of the greenest multi-family housing cooperative complexes in North America. And like most developers, Communitas wanted to build it with as little 'green' premium as possible. This was, after all, to be affordable housing.
   In the beginning, the vision was to see how close the project could get to being a net-zero energy, zero carbon emissions project and still remain affordable. It evolved, through the assistance of grant research financing received from the EQuilibrium Communities Initiative (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and Natural Resources Canada), to an affordable development seeking Passive House Certification, including an on-site waste water treatment facility. And furthermore, the need to research 'green financing' arose. How would Communitas best fund the green premium so that the units could stay affordable? So even though this project is still in the research and design phase, the evolution of the design process, the waste water treatment plant, and the green financing research has yielded some interesting information worth sharing.

TI  - The impact of energy performance on single-family home selling prices in Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to test whether energy performance effects single-family home sale prices. It also examines whether recommendations for supposedly cost-effective energy efficiency measures, by intervention category (construction, installation or operation/control technical measures), are perceived as untapped potential - a real option - that effects sale prices.
   Design/methodology/approach - The energy performance measurement and dummy variables for three categories of improvement recommendations are included as explanatory variables in a hedonic regression analysis using transaction data and energy performance certificates data for 1,073 observations.
   Findings - Results indicate that better energy performance effects selling prices positively. Energy efficiency recommendations seem to have an impact on sale price; home buyers seem to require a larger "discount" for more complex types of measures.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample only includes houses in the Stockholm; so-called sustainable buildings have not been specifically studied; and the heating source has not been accounted for.
   Originality/value - The EU energy performance certificates provide new information and measure energy performance more exactly than many earlier (proxy) variables. This is one of the first studies to test the effect of this information, and the first one using Swedish data.

CP  - 2nd Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO)
AB  - With the widespread use of smart house systems monitoring power consumption in household applications is becoming a standard. In this scope a concept of a smart house or a home automation system is often characterized by the ability to control and monitor various household appliances to provide improved convenience, comfort, energy efficiency and security. In recent years costs of smart house systems are being reduced, however even for smaller systems they can be substantial (costs of installation, ongoing costs etc.). In this paper we propose a basic architecture for a smart house system targeted at increased safety and user awareness on power consumption. The main goal here is the design of cost effective solution used for monitoring power consumption at power outlets with the ability of user notification. The system has the ability to report instantaneous power consumption levels and issue a warning of a possible power overload. Communication component was realized using Power Line Communication (PLC) proposed communication protocol. Main advantages of the proposed system include low cost, overload protection and power consumption estimation at each power outlet, increasing user awareness resulting in more effective power consumption.

The fact that companies are building factories all over the world doesn't make it easier for the architect to react appropriately to the conditions of the different locations. A research project of TU Munchen in cooperation with Siemens Real Estate investigated this issue for two different climate zones. A sensitivity analysis that determines the parameters that have a high influence on the factory's energy demand is combined with a range of energy-input for different industrial processes. The study presents conceptual solution approaches to energy efficient factories to support the planning process.

TI  - Energy disclosure, market behavior, and the building data ecosystem
T2  - IMPLICATIONS OF A DATA DRIVEN-BUILT ENVIRONMENT
CP  - Conference on Implications of a Data-Driven Built Environment
AB  - Energy disclosure laws represent one of the most promising public policy tools to accelerate market transformation around building energy efficiency. For this type of information to have an impact on market behavior, it must be collected, analyzed, and disseminated to support the decision-making processes of each end user and influence both the producers and consumers of building performance data. This paper explores the significance of energy disclosure requirements and outlines a framework for utilizing these new sources of transparent, publicly available information. It presents the mechanisms by which information can alter market behavior in the commercial real estate sector and develops a wiring diagram for the flows of information through the building data ecosystem. It concludes with a discussion of the motivations, metrics, and constraints faced by the various stakeholders in the ecosystem and how these factors influence investment decision models.

TI  - Energy consumption and savings: A survey-based study of Finnish households
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY
AB  - Energy has moved to the forefront in societal and economic development. Our homes and real estate are more and more dependent on electricity. In order to reach the full potential for new consumer-oriented market mechanisms and in order to fulfil climate policy targets we need more information on consumers' behaviour and attitudes towards energy. This paper uses a survey to examine the attitudes and behaviour of households' energy-related issues. The analytical framework used is based on ordered choice and probability models. The objective is to identify households' characteristics that affect energy consumption and savings, attitudes towards climate change and conservation of natural resources, and the importance of municipal energy-related issues. According to the results, the importance of reduction in electricity consumption is positively correlated with attitudes towards mitigation of climate change and importance of renewable energy. Heating system of residence, income, and gender affect attitude and behaviour. Interestingly, the higher the income the less important is electricity reduction. Women have changed their behaviour in order to reduce electricity consumption more than men. Utilising this information it is possible for society to build efficient mechanisms, such as real-time pricing, through which we can affect consumers' energy-related behaviour and give incentives for energy savings and efficiency. One interesting result is also that over 80% of the respondents view municipalities' energy efficiency as very important.

TI  - High-Efficiency Retrofit Lessons for Retail from a SuperTarget
T2  - 2013 ASHRAE WINTER CONFERENCE
CP  - ASHRAE Winter Conference
AB  - Retail buildings are responsible for approximately 18% of energy consumed by commercial buildings in the United States (EIA 2008). They offer a great opportunity for energy savings because retail stores have many similarities, and because large companies can implement successful energy efficiency strategies across their portfolios. Recognizing this potential, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) formed the Commercial Building Partnership (CBP) program to work with select companies in retail and commercial real estate to reduce energy consumption by 30% in existing buildings and 50% in new construction versus ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 (ASHRAE 2004a). The National Renewable Energy Laboratory partnered with Target under the CBP program to design and implement a retrofit of a SuperTarget in Thornton, Colorado. The result was a retrofit design that predicted 37% energy savings over ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004, and 29% compared to existing (pre-retrofit) store consumption. Energy simulations of each efficiency measure played a key role in determining a mix of solutions that would provide the best value and yield the highest savings. The largest savings came from energy-efficient lighting and cooling systems, improved refrigeration, and better control of plug loads. The results of this effort will be carried forward to inform the retrofit of other stores across the nation. Other companies will also be able to use these results to achieve DOE's energy efficiency goals.

TI  - Capitalization of energy efficiency on corporate real estate portfolio value
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether energy efficiency is capitalized in rent and asset value on corporate real estate portfolio. This approach contributes to the research on "green buildings" by using hedonic regression modeling on a portfolio of existing buildings in the French corporate real estate context.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply hedonic methods on a French corporate real estate portfolio which is composed of industrial, commercial and office buildings.
   Findings - This model emphasizes two main results: energy efficiency is more capitalized in rent than in asset value and this relationship differs regarding buildings' type.
   Originality/value - The model suggests that premium for energy efficiency is stronger for commercial and office buildings than for industrial buildings.

TI  - Breaking barriers to interoperability: assigning spatially and temporally unique identifiers to spaces and buildings
T2  - IMPLICATIONS OF A DATA DRIVEN-BUILT ENVIRONMENT
CP  - Conference on Implications of a Data-Driven Built Environment
AB  - The real estate industry routinely uses specialized information systems for functions, including design, construction, facilities management, brokerage, tax assessment, and utilities. These systems are mature and effective within vertically integrated market segments. However, new questions are reaching across these traditional information silos. For example, buyers may be interested in evaluating the design, energy efficiency characteristics, and operational performance of a commercial building. This requires the integration of information across multiple databases held by different institutions. Today, this type of data integration is difficult to automate and propone to errors due, in part, to the lack of generally accepted building and spaces identifiers. Moving forward, the real estate industry needs a new mechanism to assign identifiers for whole buildings and interior spaces for the purpose of interoperability, data exchange, and integration. This paper describes a systematic process to identify activities occurring at building or within interior spaces to provide a foundation for exchange and interoperability. We demonstrate the application of the approach with a prototype Web application. This concept and demonstration illustrate the elements of a practical interoperability framework that can increase productivity, create new business opportunities, and reduce errors, waste, and redundancy.

TI  - How transaction costs affect real estate developers entering into the building energy efficiency (BEE) market?
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Buildings consume a major proportion of the electricity power in most cities, thus promoting building energy efficiency (BEE) will directly contribute to low carbon cities. Some studies suggest that the additional investment on BEE should be well paid off by higher selling prices or more savings in term of life cycle costing. Real estate developers are profit driven and working in a competitive environment. However, it appears that real estate developers are skeptical in entering the BEE market, which requires alternate theories to explain their behaviors. In this study, we attempt incorporating transaction cost economics (ICE) and game theoretical frameworks into the analysis. It suggests that the anticipated transaction costs entailed in the provision of BEE products due to such factors as bounded rationality, opportunism and contractual hazards, combined with the asymmetrical information in the BEE market have curtailed the developers' interests. This study also leads to suggesting some policy recommendations to induce the developers entering into the BEE market by reducing the transaction costs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud systems using Learning Automata
T2  - 2013 13TH IRANIAN CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (IFSC)
CP  - 13th Iranian Conference on Fuzzy Systems (IFSC)
AB  - In recent years, the IT infrastructure due to the demand for computing power which used by applications are rapidly growing and modern data centers in cloud computing are hosting a variety of advanced applications. The high energy cost and green-house gas emissions are significant problems that have emerged as results of using large data centers. Thus providing an efficient method to reduce energy consumption by data centers is highly regarded by researchers. In this paper we present a new approach based on Learning Automata for dynamic replacement of virtual machines over data centers to reduce power consumption. Live migration and forcing idle nodes to sleep constitute main policies of this approach. To evaluate the proposed method, the workload is used in the real world. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method significantly reduces the energy consumption However, the efficiency of the system is preserved to a considerable extent.

TI  - Portfolio greenness and the financial performance of REITs
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of the energy efficiency and sustainability of commercial properties on the operating and stock performance of a sample of US REITs, providing insight into the net benefits of green buildings. We match data on LEED- and Energy Star-certified buildings with detailed information on REIT portfolios and calculate the share of green properties for each REIT over the 2000-2011 period. We estimate a two-stage regression model and document that the greenness of REITs is positively related to three measures of operating performance - return on assets, return on equity and the ratio of funds from operations to total revenue. We also document that there is no significant relationship between the greenness of property portfolios and abnormal stock returns, suggesting that stock prices already reflect the higher cash flows deriving from investments in more efficient properties. However, REITs with a higher fraction of green properties display significantly lower market betas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Is added sustainability equal to added value?
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Buildings are the most important economical sector in the world but also the major contributors of environmental damage, from the sourcing of raw materials through to the energy used for their functioning and to the disposal of their elements once their life cycle comes to an end. Almost half of the UK's carbon emissions come from the use of buildings and houses alone account for more than 30% of all primary energy demand. In an attempt to reduce this impact, the British Government is pushing towards the development of energy efficient and zero carbon buildings, both in new construction and in the existing stock.
   But how is the market receiving such buildings? Are energy efficient buildings gaining a competitive advantage in the current marketplace? In some countries such as The Netherlands, energy efficient houses reach values 2.8% higher on average than normal houses. In the UK the Sustainability Property Index (ISPI) reveals that, for the properties examined in 2010, regular properties delivered a cumulative total return of -10.8%, compared with -14.9% for more energy efficient ones. This is bad news considering the higher capital investment usually needed to achieve zero carbon buildings.
   The current reality in the UK market seems to be that people may not (yet) be willing to pay more rent for energy efficient buildings. As rent and capital value are inexorably linked, whether or not a building is zero carbon does not yet seem to be affecting property value. This paper does not present definitive answers but discusses possible reasons for that through two case studies and their positions in the marketplace, and suggests that the situation may change as energy prices increase and buildings acquire a potential 'earning capacity' through the use of renewable energy technologies and feed-in tariffs. The introduction of Energy Performance Certificates has also started to impact on the market. Could energy efficient buildings become a property sector in their own right in the near future, with premium priced accordingly? Or is simply that we do not yet have an ability to identify from the data whether the market is differentiating? (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy Performance Certificate of building and confidence interval in assessment: An Italian case study
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - The Directive 2002/91/CE introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), an energy policy tool. The aim of the EPC is to inform building buyers about the energy performance and energy costs of buildings. The EPCs represent a specific energy policy tool to orient the building sector and real-estate markets toward higher energy efficiency buildings. The effectiveness of the EPC depends on two factors:
   center dot The accuracy of energy performance evaluation made by independent experts.
   center dot The capability of the energy classification and of the scale of energy performance to control the energy index fluctuations.
   In this paper, the results of a case study located in Italy are shown. In this example, 162 independent technicians on energy performance of building evaluation have studied the same building. The results reveal which part of confidence intervals is dependent on software misunderstanding and that the energy classification ranges are able to tolerate the fluctuation of energy indices. The example was chosen in accordance with the legislation of the Emilia-Romagna Region on Energy Efficiency of Buildings. Following these results, some thermo-economic evaluation related to building and energy labelling are illustrated, as the EPC, which is an energy policy tool for the real-estate market and building sector to find a way to build or retrofit an energy efficiency building.

TI  - Residential energy use and conservation: Economics and demographics
T2  - EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Energy consumption in the residential sector offers an important opportunity for conserving resources. However, much of the current debate regarding energy efficiency in the housing market focuses on the physical and technical determinants of energy consumption, neglecting the role of the economic behavior of resident households. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which the use of gas and electricity is determined by the technical specifications of the dwelling as compared to the demographic characteristics of the residents. Our analysis is based on a sample of more than 300,000 Dutch homes and their occupants. The results indicate that residential gas consumption is determined principally by structural dwelling characteristics, such as the vintage, building type, and characteristics of the dwelling, while electricity consumption varies more directly with household composition, in particular income and family composition. Combining these results with projections on future economic and demographic trends, we find that, even absent price increases for residential energy, the aging of the population and their increasing wealth will roughly offset improvements in the energy efficiency of the building stock resulting from policy interventions and natural revitalization.

TI  - The impact of energy labels and accessibility on office rents
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Energy consumption in the commercial property sector offers an important opportunity for conserving resources. In this study, we evaluate the financial implications of two elements of "sustainability" - energy efficiency and accessibility - in the market for commercial real estate. An empirical analysis of some 1100 leasing transactions in the Netherlands over the 2005-2010 period shows that buildings designated as inefficient (with an EU energy performance certificate D or worse) command rental levels that are some 6.5 percent lower as compared to energy efficient, but otherwise similar buildings (labeled A, B or C). Furthermore, this study shows that office buildings in multi-functional areas, with access to public transport and facilities, achieve rental premiums over mono-functional office districts. For policymakers, the results documented in this paper provide an indication on the effectiveness of the EU energy performance certificate as a market signal in the commercial property sector. The findings documented here are also relevant for investors in European office markets, as the importance of energy efficiency and locational diversification is bound to increase following stricter environmental regulation and changing tenant preferences.

TI  - The nascent market for "green" real estate in Beijing
T2  - EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - In recent years, formal certification programs for rating and evaluating the sustainability and energy efficiency of buildings have proliferated around the world. Developers recognize that such "green labels" differentiate products and allow them to charge a price premium. China has not formally adopted such rating standards. In the absence of such standards, developers are competing with each other based on their own self-reported indicators of their buildings' "greenness". We create an index using Google search to rank housing complexes in Beijing with respect to their "marketing greenness" and document that these "green" units sell for a price premium at the presale stage but they subsequently resell or rent for a price discount. An introduction of a standardized official certification program would help "green" demanders to acquire units that they desire and would accelerate the advance of China's nascent green real estate market.

TI  - Economic returns to energy-efficient investments in the housing market: Evidence from Singapore
T2  - REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS
CP  - Symposium on Urbanization and Housing in Asia
AB  - Since January of 2005, 250 building projects in the City of Singapore have been awarded the Green Mark for energy efficiency and sustainability. This paper analyzes the private returns to these investments, evaluating the premium in asset values they command in the market. We analyze almost 37,000 transactions in the Singapore housing market to estimate the economic impact of the Green Mark program on Singapore's residential sector.
   We adopt a two-stage research design; in the first stage, a hedonic pricing model is estimated based on transactions involving green and non-green residential units in 697 individual projects or estates. In the second stage, the fixed effects estimated for each project are regressed on the location attributes of the projects, as well as control variables for a Green Mark rating. Our results suggest that the economic returns to green building are substantial.
   This is one of the first analyses of the economics of green building in the residential sector, and the only one analyzing property markets in Asia. Our results provide insight about the operation of the housing market in one country, but the policy implications about the economic returns to sustainable investments in the property market may have broader applications for emerging markets in Asia.

TI  - Domestic energy use and householders' energy behaviour
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper discusses domestic energy use and energy behaviour. It shows some improvement in domestic energy consumption and adoption of good energy practice. The survey conducted indicated that 35% of homes could improve their energy efficiency by improved tank insulation. In the last 5 years condensing boilers have been installed only in 3% of homes, indicating that householders are unaware of their advantages. Although 88% of surveyed homes had purchased a major appliance in the last 2 years, only 16% had any idea of the energy rating of their new appliances. Use of energy saving light bulbs is predominant in kitchens compared to other rooms. 70-80% of householders undertook some kind of day-to-day energy efficiency measures. 20-35% of householders would like to invest in energy-saving measures but found cost to be a key barrier. Approximately 84% of those surveyed were unaware of the energy rating of their household appliances. Price and brand were the most important factors determining the purchase of a new appliance. Significant energy-saving could be achieved by providing appropriate information to the general public regarding temperature control, efficiency of appliances and energy-saving heating systems.

TI  - Radio Signal Propagation and Attenuation Measurements for Modern Residential Buildings
T2  - 2012 IEEE GLOBECOM WORKSHOPS (GC WKSHPS)
CP  - IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps)
AB  - This paper outlines problems that cellular network operators will face as energy-efficient housing becomes more popular. We report measurement results from houses made of modern construction materials that are required to achieve sufficient level of energy-efficiency, but that impact heavily also on radio signal propagation. Energy-efficiency is especially important in northern countries, where houses need to be properly isolated as heating generates a big share of the total energy consumption of households. However, the energy-efficiency trend will also reach rest of the Europe and other warmer countries as the tightening energy-efficiency requirements concern also cooling the houses. The measurement results indicate severe problems originating from radio signal attenuation as it increases up to 35 dB for individual construction materials for cellular frequencies around 2 GHz. From the perspective of actual building penetration losses in modern, energy-efficient houses, average attenuation values even up to 30 dB have been measured. Additional attenuation is very sensitive to buildings materials, but could jeopardize cellular coverage in the future.

TI  - Learning from interventions aimed at mainstreaming solar hot water in the Australian market
T2  - 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOLAR HEATING AND COOLING FOR BUILDINGS AND INDUSTRY (SHC 2012)
CP  - 1st International Conference on Solar Heating and Cooling for Buildings and Industry (SHC)
AB  - Domestic water heating in Australia conventionally uses electric resistance heating storage or gas fuelled water heaters. The Australian electricity supply has some of the highest greenhouse gas emissions factors in the world. Consequently, water heating is responsible for approximately 24 percent of residential sector greenhouse gas emissions in Australia.
   To assist households to move towards an energy efficient, low carbon future, a suite of market intervention programs to support solar hot water uptake have been introduced at both state and federal levels. These programs aim to improve the capacity of industry to deliver solar solutions, reduce the emissions intensity and net cost of household water heating, and increase the market share of the solar water heating sector. Incentives include:
   Point of sale rebates and certificate-based programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy;
   Regulations for new houses that encourage solar water heating installations;
   Community awareness programs; and
   Training programs for installers to ensure that tradespeople have the competencies to size systems and the skills to install them correctly.
   In some jurisdictions the incentive programs were performance-based, but in others a fixed rebate amount was available for all systems having performance above a minimum threshold.
   These programs have lead to the widespread expansion of the industry, with an almost doubling of the proportion of households with solar water heaters between 1999 and 2011. Installations in new homes have seen an even more marked increase: For example, regulations for new homes in the state of Victoria require the installation of a solar water heater or rainwater tank. This program has seen the adoption of solar water heaters in new homes increase from around 5% in 2004 to over 70% in 2011.
   Across most of Australia there are proposed regulations limiting the emissions intensity of replacement water heaters which will effectively ban resistance electric water heaters in most situations. Recently both South Australia and Queensland commenced their program for existing houses.
   It is expected that in the future these programs will drive an even greater uptake, which will go some way to insulating Australian households from price increases that may result from carbon driven future increases in the cost of energy.
   This paper discusses the various approaches and outcomes of the different programs and provides analysis of the basis of program success or improvements.
   Learning relevant to market interventions worldwide include
   Continuity in program operation is necessary to allow industry to grow in a sustainable way.
   Basing the incentive on independently derived performance results provides industry with a means of differentiating better products and provides purchasers with appropriate guidance.
   Rebate program design should consider the consumer's purchasing priorities. For example, a point of sale discount awarded as part of the purchase transaction aligns with the urgency of the purchasing process and does not require additional cash to be available from the purchaser.
   Design of the schemes can not only produce a greater market share, but can also encourage the manufacture of lower greenhouse gas emissions products.
   Market interventions can have unintended consequences, so the programs need to be monitored and flexibility maintained to changes to avoid poor outcomes. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or peer-review under responsibility of PSE AG

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine current trends in energy efficiency ratings and consider their likely impact on the Australian housing market.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research is yet to be conducted; however a mixed method is proposed which is grounded on the theoretical model of consumer behaviour within housing markets. This model has been tested and demonstrated to be useful in predicting buyer behaviour.
   Findings - Established theories of buyer perception indicate the introduction of energy efficiency rating systems will have an effect on the level of house prices.
   Research limitations/implications - This research is focussed on housing in Australia but also has implications for other global housing markets which are addressing sustainability.
   Practical implications - Outputs of this research have implications for policy makers, real estate agents and valuers.
   Social implications - Increasing energy costs is likely to restructure the way housing markets operate with regard to sustainability and energy efficiency rating systems and also how they are understood.
   Originality/value - This research will be in the Australian context utilising international modeling. As mandatory energy efficiency ratings have not been introduced, this research will be original.

TI  - The green preferences of commercial tenants in Helsinki
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to find out the green preferences of corporate occupiers in relation to their occupied offices. The study aims to focus on the preferences of the end-users at the organisational level. It also aims to study the relative importance of these preferences against one another and to seek the differences between respondent groups.
   Design/methodology/approach - The survey is a case study approach concentrating on the situation in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Finland) in the summer of 2009. The survey was conducted as an internet-based questionnaire with e-mail invitations. The importance of nine given green attributes of the office buildings were ranked on a five-point Likert scale. A total of 90 responses were analysed.
   Findings - The results show that location achieved the highest importance, even though it was rated in terms of the environmental sense only. The energy efficiency of a building was ranked second. The indicative results suggest that industry sector and the position of the respondent effect the importance of the preferences.
   Research limitations/implications - The Helsinki Metropolitan Area was the focus of the study, but it is believed that the results can be generalised to other office market areas in Finland.
   Practical implications - The findings will benefit the management of occupying organisations, real estate investors and marketers who may now deepen their understanding of the preferences of corporate occupiers. The results may be useful to organisations promoting green buildings.
   Originality/value - The mainstream sustainability research in the real estate sector has focused on green buildings in the area of new construction, and economical and technical approaches. This study concentrates on end-users' considerations at the organisational level and green preferences in the existing office stock.

TI  - PROPOSED SUSTAINABLE DESIGN ALTERNATIVES FOR LOW-INCOME AND MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSING IN A COASTAL AREA IN A DEVELOPING COUNTRY
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY 2011, PTS A-C
CP  - ASME 5th International Conference on Energy Sustainability
AB  - Developing nations face increasing economic and environmental challenges and the search for housing design solutions that approach sustainability by meeting thermal comfort, energy efficiency, environmental and low initial cost criteria is underway. This paper presents the results of a multidisciplinary research project that aimed at designing a low-income house and a middle-income house that perform well from the architectural, thermal comfort, and energy efficiency standpoint while being cost-competitive. Multiple passive cooling strategies were considered and evaluated by energy modeling tools. The thermal and energy performance of the proposed designs were analyzed throughout the design process and the various design iterations. A full budget was prepared for the proposed low-income housing design and first-costs were found to be competitive with conventional housing. The paper discusses the proposed design features, their impact on thermal comfort and energy efficiency and the feasibility of integrating alternative energy systems to the proposed designs.

TI  - Emerging Issues in Real Estate Appraisal: Market Premium for Building Sustainability
T2  - AESTIMUM
AB  - In international and metropolitan real estate markets, it has been detected, for the first time, the growing relevance of green buildings with respect to non-green building. Also, it has been singled out and then quantified through regression analysis a green premium, i.e. a differential in terms of price toward sold real estate units having ecological characteristics along with an energy value (more efficient behavior). The incipient international studies recommend to extend the analysis to unexplored middle-size non-metropolitan (marginal) real estate markets. One of this areas has been studied detecting the first sale of an apartment with energy certification belonging to class B in a building with ecological characteristics. The assessment analysis performed through Market Comparison Approach, MCA, made it possible to detect and then appraise the green premium that is in line with the outcomes of the first and pioneer international studies performed in metropolitan areas.

TI  - An Analysis and Evaluation on Adaptability of Wall-hung Mounted Gas Boiler between Indemnificatory Residential Buildings in Beijing
T2  - PROGRESS IN POWER AND ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, PTS 1 AND 2
CP  - International Conference on Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development (ICEESD 2011)
AB  - With an increasing emphasis on easy operation, flexible adjustment and high energy efficiency, the application of the wall-hung gas boiler are becoming more widely considered among the residential building as a competitive or alternative way to district and central heating in Beijing. It meets the implementation of the policies in twelve-five year plan of China: improving Beijing's environment and future sustainable transform on its coal-based energy structure. A survey of the heating way of indemnificatory housing, price-fixed housing and affordable housing in Beijing is proposed. The results show that the heating area using the wall-hung gas boiler in the resident building is 55% of the total heating area in Beijing and 67% of the total heating area in new buildings. Then, the adaptability between the household wall-hung gas boiler heating way and other heating ways is compared. The energy efficiency, initial investment, operating cost and user satisfaction are discussed. The final analysis is then evaluated by a panel of experts to determine its accuracy and potential for use in a greenway development plan of heating way in Beijing.

TI  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY IN MIXED INCOME HOUSING DEVELOPMENT: A CASE OF COSMO CITY JOHANNESBURG.
T2  - 2012 SOUTHERN AFRICAN ENERGY EFFICIENCY CONVENTION (SAEEC)
CP  - Southern African Energy Efficiency Convention (SAEEC)
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the social, environmental and financial benefits (including the impact thereof) of implementing energy and thermal efficiency technologies Solar Water Heating (SWH) and passive thermal intervention in low income housing development project. Problem of investigation: South African housing backlog is estimated at 2.1 million households that do not have access to adequate housing. The housing subsidy which is government assistance to household to access housing does not include the provision of ceilings or geysers and it is noted that 54% of household in South Africa do not have geysers. Cosmo City located north of Johannesburg K553 emerged out of an urgent need to provide accommodation for the informal settlers of Zevenfontein and Riverbend who had been illegally occupying privately owned land 25km to the North West of the Johannesburg Central Business District CBD. These informal settlements were characterized by substandard living conditions, low level of income, high unemployment, low level of education and limited access to basic services. The development of Cosmo City as a mixed income housing project in South Africa is aimed at addressing complex and peculiar circumstances as compared to other international experiences. The units which range between, 36 m(2) and 40 m2 were fitted with energy efficiency interventions which included Solar Water Heating (SWH) system by Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA). Hence, this investigation tends to review this project and question the extent to which this intervention has assisted in reducing electricity cost for the households and enhance comfort and quality of life of the residents with associated behavioural change as well as promotion of sustainable environmental practices.

TI  - REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS' CONCERNS ABOUT UNCERTAINTY IN BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY (BEE) INVESTMENT-A TRANSACTION COSTS (TCS) PERSPECTIVE
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Buildings account for 40% of global energy consumption and nearly one-third of global CO2 emissions; and the resulting carbon footprint significantly exceeds that of all forms of transportation combined. Attractive opportunities exist to reduce buildings' energy use at lower costs and higher returns than in other sectors. This paper analyzes the concerns of uncertainty, in terms of transaction costs, to the real estate developers when they make decisions about investing in Building Energy Efficiency (BEE). To solicit views of developers regarding BEE investment, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 executives and architects who work in big real estate development firms covering 80% of real estate activities in Hong Kong. This research applies transaction cost economics (TCE) to study the underlying reasons resulting from uncertainty that cause market reluctance to accept BEE by choice. It provides a detailed analysis of the current situation and future prospects for BEE adoption through studying the impacts from three aspects: economic, market and policy uncertainties. It delineates the market and suggests possible policy solutions to overcome the uncertainties and to attain the large-scale deployment of energy-efficient building techniques. The findings establish the groundwork for future studies on how to choose a particular policy package and what roles government should play to solve the existing problems in BEE development.

TI  - Land use, mobility and energy consumption - Poster of ideas for the classification of urban settlements
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF EWGT 2012 - 15TH MEETING OF THE EURO WORKING GROUP ON TRANSPORTATION
CP  - 15th Meeting of the Euro-Working-Group-on-Transportation (EWGT)
AB  - In this paper a method that allows to classify homogeneous zones according to the estimated energy consumption for the annual mobility per capita is proposed. With Directive 2002/91/EC, in the UE territory all real estate must have an energy performance certificate. This certification estimates the annual energetic needs of a building and then determines its energetic class identified by a letter from A+ to G. Here it is proposed to apply the same idea to the transport sector and urban planning. This certification will help to increase the performances of the transport system for the benefit of users and environment. Land use and city planning influence the energy consumption, so new plans should be subject to minimum energy performance measures according to local conditions. This will establish minimum levels of energy efficiency that new settlements will have to meet. The proposed methodology, if applied to existing zones will help to identify the least efficient and provides for them measures for improvement. The determination of the class will depend on the energy consumption estimated by simulations of travel throughout the vast area in which the zone under investigation is located. Then we can identify the number of O/D trips for each area of the wide, their traveled distance and mode of transportation. Once estimated, from these data, the per capita consumption for the transport of the inhabitants (of the vast), it is possible define the threshold of transition from one class to another, and then categorize all zones located within it. The proposed classification will be used to vary the costs of urbanization and the taxation of real estate according to the energy performance of the zone. In conclusion, as the class is an indicator easily understood by all, this method will bring local government and public opinion toward more efficient choices and to introduce new design standards.

TI  - Housing Tenure, Energy Consumption and the Split-Incentive Issue in Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING POLICY
AB  - In recent years, there has been growing global recognition of the need to reduce carbon emissions in response to climate change concerns. It is generally acknowledged that the energy efficiency of existing homes can be improved, but there are significant barriers to its uptake. In particular, improving the energy efficiency of private rental housing presents unique policy challenges due to a split-incentive problem. This has prompted some governments to introduce programmes that encourage landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. While landlords are responsible for the purchase of many energy-consuming household appliances, tenants are responsible for energy bills. Since the landlord does not reap the immediate benefits of investment in energy-efficient equipment, the incentives motivating such investment are weaker than for homeowners. This paper aims to quantify the magnitude of the split-incentive problem in the Australian private rental housing market by invoking a modelling approach where energy expenditure is estimated as a function of housing tenure, dwelling type, location, climate and other socio-demographic variables. We find no evidence in support of the split-incentive hypothesis in Australia. The paper concludes that differences in housing policy arrangements could be critical to the presence and importance of split incentives.

TI  - Towards energy self-sufficiency in wastewater treatment by optimized sludge treatment
T2  - WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The role of sludge in renewable energy production and the final disposal of sludge are topical issues. The cost of sludge treatment account for a significant share of the total running costs of a WWTP. By increasing the efficiency of sludge treatment, significant savings can be achieved. Savings can be gained e.g. by more efficient energy utilisation of sludge, combined with optimised wastewater treatment processes. In addition to cost efficiency, environmental sustainability of the applied solutions is crucial. The energy balance and green house gas emissions can be used as tools to evaluate the sustainability of sludge treatment options.
   This paper presents a case-based comparison of energy balances, green house gas emissions and costs of municipal wastewater sludge process chains based on anaerobic digestion or incineration. Information from existing plants was used for conducting the study. Several utilisation options were covered for biogas energy as well for energy from sludge incineration.
   Based on the results, sludge incineration was the most expensive option of the studied scenarios, but justified if the heat generated can be fully utilised e.g. in district heating. Based on costs and energy balances as well as green house gas emissions it is most preferable in anaerobic digestion chains to feed the generated biogas to a gas engine to produce electricity and heat. Moreover, thermophilic anaerobic digestion can improve the overall economy of a WWTP provided that the biogas yield is sufficiently higher than in a mesophilic process. However increased odour is a risk in thermophilic digestion.
   The study showed that the most energy efficient process modifications are always very case bound. However the tools developed in this study are generally applicable to waste water treatment plants for similar analyses.

TI  - Environmental Assessment Methodologies for Commercial Buildings: An Elicitation Study of US Building Professionals' Beliefs on Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Voluntary environmental programs (VEPs) have become increasingly popular around the world to address energy efficiency issues that mandatory building codes have not been able to tackle. Even though the utility of voluntary schemes is widely debated, they have become a de facto reality for many professionals in the building and construction sector. One topic that is neglected, however, in both academic and policy discussions, relates to how professionals (architects, engineers, real estate developers, etc.) perceive the rise of voluntary rating schemes. In order to fill this gap in the literature, the present study investigates beliefs underlying adoption behavior regarding one of the most prominent voluntary assessment and certification programs in the U. S. building industry, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) scheme. In this paper, an elicitation study, based on 14 semi-structured interviews with building professionals in the North East of the United States, was conducted to analyze this question. Building on the Reasoned Action Approach, this paper shows that, in addition to more conventional factors such as financial calculations and marketing aspects, the understanding of beliefs held by building professionals offers important insights into their decisions to work with Voluntary Environmental Assessment and Rating Programs.

TI  - Read the label! Energy Star appliance label awareness and uptake among US consumers
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - The Energy Star label program to promote the diffusion of energy efficient home appliances is arguably the most significant government effort to reduce U.S. residential energy consumption. Program effectiveness requires that consumers are aware of the labeling scheme and also change their purchase decisions based on label information. This paper examines the factors associated with consumer awareness of the Energy Star label of recently purchased 'white' major appliances and the factors associated with the choice of Energy Star labeled appliances. The paper finds that household characteristics have a much stronger association with consumer awareness of labels than with the choice of Energy Star appliances. Renting the home. Hispanic ethnicity, being poor or near poor, and living in regions with lower ACEEE scores do, however, decrease the propensity for households to purchase Energy Star appliances. Eliminating these gaps in Energy Star appliance adoption would result in house electricity cost savings of $164 million per year and associated carbon emission reductions of about 1.1 million metric tons per year.

TI  - Economic feasibility of energy efficiency measures in residential buildings
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB  - A study has been performed to develop cost benefit data to be used by a local electric utility in defining a rebate program to encourage energy efficient construction in the Desert Southwest region of the USA. Several potential efficiency upgrades for production homes in the region were identified and an evaluation of each building component was performed using building energy simulation software. A model home developed in Las Vegas was used to calibrate the numerical model and was considered as a basis for further study. The validated building models were then used to predict the annual energy savings and payback periods for various upgrades. In all cases, comparisons were made to code-built houses with the same general overall characteristics. Useful life of most of these upgrades far exceeds their payback periods. It is found that a typical house, with the cost-effective upgrades installed, consumed 42.5% less annual energy compared to a home built to code. A 3.19 kWp PV system installed on the south-facing roof of the home can generate 5982 kWh annually, making it a net-zero (electrical) energy home. PV systems in Las Vegas have encouraging benefit cost ratios when federal and state rebates are considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of Energy Performance Certificates on the rental and capital values of commercial property assets
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper focuses on the effect of energy performance ratings on appraised capital values, rental values and equivalent yields of UK commercial property assets. The study is based on a cross-section of 708 commercial property assets. Incorporating a range of potential confounding factors such as unexpired lease term, vacancy rate and tenant credit risk, we use hedonic regression procedures to estimate the effect of EPC rating on rental and capital values. The study finds no evidence of a significant relationship between environmental and/or energy performance and rental and capital values. A small subset of 24 BREEAM-rated assets is also tested for significant price effects but a statistically significant effect is only confirmed for equivalent yields. Similarly, there was no evidence that the EPC rating had any effect on Market Rent or Market Value with only minor effects of EPC ratings on equivalent yields. The preliminary conclusion is that energy labelling is not yet having the effects on Market Values and Market Rents that would be expected if high EPC ratings were associated with substantial cost savings that are fully reflected in capital values and/or were readily available and taken into account by prospective tenants and buyers.

TI  - Method and system for Multi-Attribute Market Value Assessment in analysis of construction and retrofit projects
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) methods prioritize the alternatives of comparative projects quite accurately. Problems arise when there is a need to determine the utility degrees and market values of the project alternatives. This becomes especially important for establishing the market value of real estate property in tender offers. However, the available MADM methods cannot accomplish this. Thus the authors of this article developed the MAMVA method, which permits determining the utility degrees and market values of project alternatives, and also developed a system on the basis of this developed method. This article presents the proposed Multi-Attribute Market Value Assessment (MAMVA) Method and the Decision Support System for Construction and Retrofit Projects (DSS-CRP). It also presents a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and system. The application of the MAMVA Method and DSS-CRP System for prioritizing and for determining the utility degrees and market values of construction and retrofit projects under consideration for financing by the European Economic Area (EEA) and Norway Financial Mechanism Grant made it possible to decrease the amount of requested support.
   This article also presents the analysis and comprehensive assessment of the noted construction and retrofit projects. These were performed in consideration of the entire life cycle of a project and of needs satisfaction relevant to all the groups interested in a project. The developed MAMVA Method and DSS-CRP System permit assessing the appropriateness of projects under analysis in conceptual and qualitative forms. This method and system automatically submit the values of the project alternatives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of the potential of natural light to illuminate buildings in dense urban environment. A study in Mendoza, Argentina
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB  - Cities display an array of microclimates closely related to the composition of their surfaces and the relationships among their structures. The effect of the shadow cast by a high-rise building is a simple case of this situation. The incidence of the shadow on other buildings or urban spaces can be positive or negative, according to the bioclimatic requirements of the place and season. The understanding of the cause of these effects is key information that helps when planning new urban complexes or refurbishing existing ones.
   Aiming at sustainable urban design, the building sector's energy efficiency, associated with bioclimatic design guidelines, is the most adequate way to achieve the desired goal and its consideration must be a priority in every situation where a high substitution potential of fossil by renewable energies exists, and it is available through control of the urban environment's morphology.
   To make the solar energy use feasible in urban environments it is necessary to incorporate design guidelines into building and urban normative as parts of integral planning by compatibilizing desirable levels of solar access with urban density and considering shape and orientation of parcels, buildings and streets.
   The paper presents the results of a study in Mendoza City, Argentina, on the daylighting potential in residential buildings, obtained through simulation and measurements "in situ". The electric energy consumed for lighting was analyzed, comparing different unit values for the apartments in the buildings of the city, considering their morphology and orientation.

TI  - On the economics of energy labels in the housing market
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Energy efficiency in the residential housing market can play an important role in the reduction of global carbon emissions. This paper reports the first evidence on the market adoption and economic implications of energy performance certificates implemented by the European Union. The results show that adoption rates are low and declining over time, coinciding with a negative sentiment regarding the label in the popular media. Labels are clustered among smaller, post-war homes in neighborhoods with more difficult selling conditions. We also document that geographic variation in the adoption rate of energy labels is positively related to the fraction of "green" voters during the 2006 national elections. Within the sample of labeled homes, the energy label creates transparency in the energy efficiency of dwellings. Our analysis shows that consumers capitalize this information into the price of their prospective homes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Enhanced supervision strategies for effective reduction of building energy consumption-A case study of Ningbo
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the reasons for ever growing energy consumption in buildings and to give enhanced supervision strategies for reduction of building energy consumption compared to regular ones. A case study of Ningbo city was used to make a detail analysis. Several factors were determined as the reasons for ever growing building energy consumption including climate change, household electricity load increase, the growth of real estate, fast-growing household electrical appliances, high energy consumption in existing buildings, changes in industrial structure and the lack of enhanced government supervision. Then the discussion of suitable countermeasures shows that only enhanced supervision strategies are currently applicable. Finally, it is concluded that enhanced government supervision strategies, including the establishment of a strict control system for new built buildings through information integration and encryption, establishing an energy efficiency supervision system of large-scale public building and a carrot-and-stick approach with added expert checklist for the building application of renewable energy, showed great advantages in promoting building energy efficiency in Ningbo. compared with other cities. These supervision strategies are applicable in other cities as they are in the similar situations in the enforcement of building energy efficiency. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Design optimisation for a low energy home in Sydney
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - A simple model for a detached house in Sydney is optimised using a building energy simulation program to reduce the annual heating and cooling requirement to the point where a heating and cooling system is no longer necessary. A net present cost analysis, including the construction cost, the HVAC capital cost, and the electricity cost for space heating and cooling, is used to conduct the optimisation. The insulation thickness of the walls and roof, the window type, the thickness of an internal thermal mass wall, and the night ventilation air change rate were varied in the optimisation. Results for the best performing optimisation cases are presented and compared with the net present cost for a similar house, designed to meet the BASIX energy efficiency requirement for New South Wales. The best performing optimisation cases are shown to have a lower net present cost than the equivalent BASIX compliant house. With a view towards creating an operationally zero energy house, an optimisation case with a very low space energy requirement is selected and a photovoltaic system is sized to cover the remaining household electricity consumption over the course of a year.

TI  - The European Commission's light bulb decree: Another costly regulation?
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Since September 2009, Regulation 244/2009 of the European Commission enforces the gradual phase-out of incandescent light bulbs. As of September 2012, only energy-efficient lighting sources will be allowed for sale. Among these are halogen light bulbs, light-emitting diodes (LED), or compact fluorescent light bulbs-often referred to as energy-saving light bulbs. The Commission's justification for the phase-out of conventional light bulbs maintains that a reduction in the electricity consumed will not only lead to lower energy cost for private households and industrial consumers, but at the same time lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This article discusses possible reasons for the slow market diffusion of energy-saving light bulbs and shows that the investment in energy-efficient light bulbs does not necessarily lead to significant cost reductions. Drawing on some illustrative examples, we demonstrate that the use of cheaper incandescent bulbs instead of energy-saving light bulbs can be economically rational in cases of rather low usage times, in which the higher initial purchasing price might only pay off after very long time spans. Furthermore, due to the coexistence with the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), this regulation attains no additional emission reductions beyond those achieved by the ETS alone. We thus conclude that the general ban of incandescent light bulbs is inappropriate and should be abolished by the Commission. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Life cycle cost implications of energy efficiency measures in new residential buildings
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - The importance of the built environment from an environmental impact and energy use perspective is well established. High thermal efficiency of the constructed building envelope is a key strategy in the design and construction of buildings which limit use of active space conditioning systems. Australia's current housing stock is thermally poor and national energy performance standards are relatively weak when benchmarked against international best practice. A lack of data has impeded the policy debate and a significant gap in analysis remains a lack of empirical research into the life-cycle cost implications of increased building thermal efficiency, particularly for residential buildings. This paper applies an integrated thermal modeling, life cycle costing approach to an extensive sample of dominant house designs to investigate life cycle costs in a cool temperate climate, Melbourne Victoria. Empirical analysis provides new insights into lifetime costs and environmental savings for volume housing design options and identifies sensitive factors. Results suggest that the most cost-effective building design is always more energy efficient than the current energy code requirements, for the full time-horizon considered. Findings have significant policy implications, particularly in view of present debates which frequently present higher energy efficiency standards as prohibitive from a costs perspective.

TI  - Air conditioning in the region of Madrid, Spain: An approach to electricity consumption, economics and CO2 emissions
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - An understanding of electricity consumption due to residential air conditioning (AC) may improve production and environmental impact strategy design. This article reports on a study of peak and seasonal electricity consumption for residential air conditioning in the region of Madrid, Spain. Consumption was assessed by simulating the operation of AC units at the outdoor summer temperature characteristics of central Spain. AC unit performance when operating under part load conditions in keeping with weather conditions was also studied to find cooling demand and energy efficiency. Likewise final electricity consumption was computed and used to calculate energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). Cooling demand, when family holidays outside the region were factored into the calculations, came to 1.46 x 10(9) kWh. Associated seasonal electricity demand was 617 x 10(6) kWh and seasonal performance of AC units around 2.4. Electricity consumption in the whole region was observed to peak on 30 June 2008 at 5.44 x 10(6) kW, being the load attributable to residential AC 1.79 x 10(6) kW, resulting about 33% of the total peak consumption. The seasonal cost per household was about (sic)156 and the total equivalent warming impact was 572 x 10(3) t CO2. The method proposed can be adapted for use in other regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Beyond Profitability of Energy-Saving Measures-Attitudes Towards Energy Saving
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER POLICY
AB  - Private homeowners can save considerable amounts of energy and money, if they retrofit their homes according to up-to-date energy efficiency standards. From an expert point of view, many of these technical measures are profitable in relatively short payback times, if only additional costs are considered. Apparently, many homeowners do not follow this type of rationality and do solely not regard their refurbishment as an investment. Drawing on the results of an empirical survey of retrofit activities among 1,008 homeowners in Germany, it is argued that refurbishments are the outcome of a broader decision which is shaped by an alliance of economic and non-economic motives and goals. Energy-saving measures is expected to lower the burden of operating costs in a perceptible way and secure the value of the house, but they must also correspond to needs like comfort, convenience or belonging in order to be realized.

TI  - Affordable passive solar design in a temperate climate: An experiment in residential building orientation
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB  - Improved energy efficiency in new residential buildings is typically being sought across the developed world through changing requirements in building and/or planning regulations. Stringency is set to further increase significantly in attempts to meet climate change mitigation goals. However, new regulation is usually met with reticence from sectors of the building industry, one reason being the additional costs implied in meeting higher performance standards for more energy efficient buildings. One low cost option, investigated in this paper, is to orient buildings in order to maximise their passive solar benefits. Using a range of 81 different detached dwelling designs, a modelling experiment was conducted in order to assess the implications of orientation on modelled thermal energy efficiency. Design adaptability to orientation change was modelled across two scenarios; current building energy efficiency standards and pending improved energy efficiency standards. The effect of size and overall energy efficiency rating was included in consideration of variance across orientations. Results show that higher standards are easier to apply to smaller dwellings, and costs are lower. Also, higher performing designs are more flexible across different orientations, producing lower standard deviations of mean ratings. The findings indicate that passive solar design is a concept that can readily be incorporated into house plans at the design stage. Recommendations for further empirical research are also made.

TI  - Opportunities and challenges in rebuilding tornado-impacted Greensburg, Kansas as "stronger, better, and greener"
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
AB  - A May 2007 tornado destroyed 95% of aging, declining Greensburg, Kansas. The city took the opportunity to build back ''stronger, better, and greener,'' enforcing upgraded codes, requiring cityowned buildings to meet LEED Platinum level standards, and recommending energy-efficiency housing in a new Sustainable Comprehensive Plan. Using information collected from surveys of Greensburg tornado survivors, interviews, and publications, we examined the housing-related recovery, including the emergency provision of temporary shelter and rebuilding permanently. Although temporary shelter kept residents nearby for rebuilding, given the gap between insurance policy limits on the aging housing stock and rebuilding costs, housing affordability is a critical issue in Greensburg's recovery. Local, state, and federal support have made construction of municipal buildings at LEED Platinum level and some affordable and green housing projects possible. However, far greater public and private sector funding for affordable workforce housing, in conjunction with broader economic and job development, is needed.

TI  - Barriers and drivers to green buildings in Australia and New Zealand
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB  - Purpose - Improving energy efficiency of buildings and appliances has been shown to be the most cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this research is to identify householders' lifestyle choices within homes that impact on energy use and their motivation to conserve energy. The results help to identify methods to increase the uptake of sustainability practices that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in residential buildings.
   Design/methodology/approach - A postal survey was adopted as the quickest and most cost-effective way of surveying a large sample of householders across Australia. The survey was sent to 2,500 randomly selected residents, 500 in each of the five largest Australian cities by population.
   Findings - The results identified that barriers to energy efficiency in households include: larger homes and smaller households; initial costs of sustainable features, and a lack of consumer information about benefits and savings from incorporating energy-efficient devices. The most common reason why people are not acting in more sustainable ways is inconvenience or laziness.
   Research limitations/implications - The response rate was very low and retired persons were over-represented, as they are the people with more time to answer surveys. Further research is warranted to achieve a larger, more representative sample.
   Practical implications - These results will be useful to Government policy makers as they help to identify methods to increase the uptake of sustainable features and energy conservation in homes.
   Originality/value - This study is the first attempt at a nation-wide study of residential behavior to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in homes.

TI  - Towards a Brazilian standard for naturally ventilated buildings: guidelines for thermal and air movement acceptability
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - The Brazilian Federal Government has been recently promoting energy-conservation initiatives, most notably the 'Thermal Performance in Buildings - Brazilian Bioclimatic Zones and Building Guidelines for Low-Cost Housing' and the 'Federal Regulation for Voluntary Labelling of Energy Efficiency Levels in Commercial, Public and Service Buildings'. These new regulations provide information for designers based on Brazil's climate requirements, with specific advice related to lighting systems, HVAC and the thermal envelope of buildings. Nevertheless, requirements for naturally ventilated indoor environments appear as an open category without clear criteria. To address this, the paper proposes guidelines for naturally ventilated environments in which specific thermal and air movement acceptability goals must be achieved. The guidelines are based on results from field experiments in non-residential naturally ventilated buildings in different climatic zones as well as drawing on other studies. The proposed guidelines consider occupants' adaptive potential as well as thermal and air movement acceptability. Combining thermal acceptability with air movement acceptability is a key design challenge. Permissible operative temperature ranges are based on the ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort standard, and minimum air velocity requirements within the occupied zone are specified. Considerations also included 'active' occupants and specific control over openings and fans. Le Gouvernement federal bresilien encourage depuis peu les initiatives en faveur des economies d'energie, et tout particulierement les initiatives << Performances Thermiques des Immeubles - Zones Bioclimatiques Bresiliennes et Directives de Construction pour les Logements a Faible Cout >> et << Reglementation Federale pour l'Etiquetage Volontaire des Niveaux de Rendement Energetique des Immeubles Commerciaux, Publics et de Services >>. Ces reglementations nouvelles fournissent aux concepteurs des informations basees sur les exigences climatiques du Bresil, et s'accompagnent de conseils specifiques relatifs aux systemes d'eclairage, aux systemes CVCA et a l'enveloppe thermique des immeubles. Neanmoins, les exigences relatives aux environnements interieurs a ventilation naturelle apparaissent comme une categorie ouverte sans criteres clairs. Pour traiter ce probleme, le present article propose des directives pour les environnements a ventilation naturelle dans lesquels des objectifs specifiques d'acceptabilite thermique et en matiere de circulation d'air doivent etre atteints. Ces directives sont basees sur les resultats d'experiences de terrain menees dans des immeubles non residentiels a ventilation naturelle dans differentes zones climatiques, mais s'appuient egalement sur d'autres etudes. Les directives proposees prennent en consideration le potentiel adaptatif des occupants aussi bien que l'acceptabilite thermique et en matiere de circulation d'air. Reussir a combiner l'acceptabilite thermique et l'acceptabilite en matiere de circulation d'air pose un probleme de conception essentiel. Les plages de temperature de service admissibles sont basees sur la norme de confort adaptatif ASHRAE 55, et les exigences minimales quant a la vitesse de l'air dans la zone occupee sont precisees. Ont egalement ete pris en consideration les occupants << actifs >> et les commandes specifiques des ouvertures et des ventilateurs.

TI  - BARRIERS AND IMPEDIMENTS TO A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PROMOTING SUPER-ENERGY-EFFICIENT (SEE) HOMES
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING
AB  - Reducing energy consumption and environmental impacts of homes remains a critical task for researchers and practitioners. Although numerous energy efficient (EE) home strategies have been developed, their adoption across the entire industry has still been limited. Nationwide, only a small number of EE homes have been built under several well-known EE home programs. Therefore, the research question of, "what prevents EE homes from being widely accepted and built?" needs to be addressed and investigated thoroughly. This paper presents the findings-a comprehensive set of barriers and impediments to the wide spread adoption of EE homes-from an on-going effort made by an alliance of researchers, educators, builders, suppliers, appraisers, real estate agents, and other parties associated with the home construction industry. These findings are being used to develop and implement a holistic action plan to advance the cause of EE homes through research, education, and outreach. The provided insights will also help other researchers, educators, practitioners and government agencies re-evaluate the strategies used in promoting EE homes and improve the effectiveness of on-going and future programs.

CP  - International Conference on Green Buildings and Sustainable Cities (GBSC)
AB  - The Directive EPBD introduced Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) an energy policy tool. The aim of EPC is to inform building buyer about energy performance (and energy cost) of buildings. They represent a specific energy policy tool to orientate building sector and retail market toward higher energy efficiency building. The Real Estate market was built in different periods, and in each of these periods the building envelope or the heating plant had different kinds of energy performance. Therefore, in real estate, each building-period has a determinate incidence respect total existing buildings, and they have different energy consumption incidence respect total energy national consumption. The EPBD recast highlight the relation between building elements or technical building system, energy rating and cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements. In present paper a discussion about Directive's news, Italian EPC and real estate market prospective is presented. Furthermore we proposed a reflection about link between energy cost, energy rating and building property value. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Among the other many qualities of a building, that of energy consumption for in house comfort is not to be ignored, because reduced energy consumption signifies not only reduced maintenance costs but also environment protection by diminishing greenhouse gas emissions. The value of the real estate, and in the last instance its price also depend on its heat, electric and gases volume, and this consumption is established by the Energy Performance Certificate. The Energy Performance Certificate of the real estates should be mandatory in Romania starting with January 1st 2011, date from which no building without this act should be constructed, sold or rent. But when analysing the Romanian legislation you realise that obtaining or using such Certificate is optional.

TI  - Applying a multi-objective optimization approach for Design of low-emission cost-effective dwellings
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Modern buildings and their HVAC systems are required to be not only energy-efficient but also produce fewer economical and environmental impacts while adhering to an ever-increasing demand for better environment. Research shows that building regulations which depend mainly on building envelope requirements do not guarantee the best environmental and economical solutions. In the current study, a modified multi-objective optimization approach based on Genetic Algorithm is proposed and combined with IDA ICE (building performance simulation program). The combination is used to minimize the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)-eq) emissions and the investment cost for a two-storey house and its HVAC system. Heating/cooling energy source, heat recovery type, and six building envelope parameters are considered as design variables. The modified optimization approach performed efficiently with the three studied cases, which address different shimmer overheating levels, and a set of optimal combinations (Pareto front) was achieved for each case. It is concluded that: (1) compared with initial design, 32% less CO(2)-eq emissions and 26% lower investment cost solution could be achieved, (2) the type of heating energy source has a marked influence on the optimal solutions, (3) the influence of the external wall, roof, and floor insulation thickness as well as the window U-value on the energy consumption and thermal comfort level can be reduced into an overall building U-value, (4) to avoid much of summer overheating, dwellings which have insufficient natural ventilation measures could require less insulation than the standard (inconsistent with energy saving requirements) and/or additional cost for shading option.

CP  - International Conference on Computer Communication and Management (ICCCM 2011)
AB  - Energy use in the building sector shares a great portion of world energy and accounts for a lot of green house gas. It is necessary to increase energy efficiency in the building sector to reduce energy cost and green house gas emissions. This paper proposes a building energy management system based on ontology, inference rules, and simulation. Ontology modeling has the advantages of information reusability, extensibility, and interoperability. It enables the BEMS to be easily deployed in the field. Building energy simulation helps the inference rules accumulated. The efficiency will be increased in proportional to the number of inference rules. The feasibility of the proposed BEMS model is shown through the pilot system. The proposed model is expected to greatly contribute to the energy saving and the reduction of green house gas emissions.

Then an adverse selection game model of the real estate developers and the energy-saving product manufacturers is brought up in the energy-efficient product market, drawing a conclusion that developers in the consumer class tend to buy some non-energy-saving building product. Through the analysis of the model and the practical examples, a solution - signal display is put forward towards the whole building energy market adverse selection problem. However, the government in providing signals to the platform can not fully grasp the authenticity of the signals provided by the building energy regulation sector and the energy-saving manufacturers and developers. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to carry out the building energy regulation sector re-regulation.

AB  - In Brazil energy efficiency standards for cold appliances was established in 2007. A specified single set of MEPS (minimum energy performance standards) for refrigerators, freezers and freezer refrigerators was implemented without evaluating its impacts and estimation of potential electricity savings. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the impacts of the Brazilian MEPS for cold appliances. It uses a bottom-up approach to estimate residential end-use consumption and to evaluate the energy saving potential for refrigerators. The household electricity consumption is projected by modeling appliance ownership using an econometric approach based on the recent household survey data. A cost-benefit analysis for more stringent standards is presented from the perspective of the society and electricity customers. The results showed that even considering the current market conditions (high discount rate for financing new efficient equipment) some MEPS options are advantageous for customers. The analysis also demonstrates significant cost-effective saving potential from the society perspective that could reach 21 TWh throughout the period of 2010-2030-about 25% of current residential consumption.

TI  - Energy efficiency measures and conversion of fossil fuel boiler systems in a detached house
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY
AB  - There is a large potential to reduce primary energy use and CO2 emissions from the Swedish building stock. Here detached houses heated by oil, natural gas or electric boilers were assessed. CO2 emissions, primary energy use and heating costs were evaluated before and after implementing house envelope measures, conversions to more efficient heating systems and changes to biomass fuel use. The study included full energy chains, from natural resources to usable heat in the houses. The aim was to evaluate the societal economic cost effectiveness of reducing CO2 emission and primary energy use by different combinations of changes. The results demonstrated that for a house using an electric boiler, a conversion to a heat pump combined with house envelope measures could be cost efficient from a societal economic perspective. If the electricity was based on biomass, the primary energy use was at the same time reduced by 70% and the CO2 emission by 97%. Large emission reductions were also seen for conversions from oil and gas boilers to a biomass-based system. However, for these conversions the heating cost increased, leading to a mitigation cost of around (sic)50/tonne C avoided. The price of oil and natural gas greatly influenced the competitiveness of the alternatives. House envelope measures were more cost-effective for houses with electric boilers as the cost of energy for this system is high. The results are specific to a Swedish context, but also give an indication of the potential in other regions, such as northern European and large parts of North America, which have both a cold climate and a widespread use of domestic boilers.

T2  - MAUERWERK
AB  - Rely on the future - Project report of a new building two-family house as an energy-value-house. In the Year 2007 Xella already started the energy-value- house-initiative. The topical reason was the uprising discussion about climate protection and the announce-ment for further tightening of the energy efficiency requirements in 2009 and following from 2012. With the aim to develop a prime quality and sustainable solid housing concept, builders of family-homes were invited to workshops. These workshops were offered nationwide and were accompanied by an expertise-team from the fields of building physics, heating and ventilation engineering, building biology, value added sales and finance. The results of these workshops were summarised in a catalogue of criteria's for energy-value-houses. In the following workshops and information meetings, new partners were attracted to join the concept and the concept was continuously improved. In the following paper the extraordinary qualities of an energy-value-house will be showed on a realized object of a two-family-house.

TI  - Consumer voices: adoption of residential energy-efficient practices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - The purpose of this research is to identify constraining variables that may impinge on adopting energy-efficient practices, materials, equipment and technology in households. The intent is to uncover relationships of attitudes, beliefs, knowledge and other resource constraints to: (1) existing housing adaptations and adjustments for energy efficiency; and (2) more efficient use of energy in homes. A second objective is to identify existing practices used to reduce energy use and the adaptations made to the existing structure, materials, equipment and technology for energy efficiency as well as their intentions to make future adaptations. Constraint variables include knowledge of existing energy-efficient practices and technology; economic constraints (household income, cost as a problem, financial need and existing energy costs); obstacles to making changes (lack of information, assistance, time, cooperation, trained persons and the condition of home); and demographic variables (age, education level and urban/rural). Attitude and belief constraints include measures of felt responsibility for energy use-related actions that impact the natural resources and environment, and measures of concern. These constraints may impinge on or contribute to making energy-efficient changes in residential households. Questionnaires were mailed to a random stratified sample of 800 households in Nebraska (US state) in April and May of 2008, resulting in a 29% return rate. The analysis indicates that the research produced information about constraining factors that impact the existing energy-efficiency levels of households. The use of energy-efficient equipment and technology, and behaviour practices that reduce energy use are related to those barriers. However, residential energy use and behaviour change result from a range of psychological and contextual influences on behaviour. Behaviour is often inconsistent with attitudes because of the presence of various constraining factors that preclude consistency with behaviour. Educational programmes have a challenging task if they are to alter attitudes and norms to overcome situational constraints. It may be more fruitful to educate and to remove the constraints impinging on those who already have a positive attitude about the need to increase energy efficiency for whatever reason.

TI  - Public awareness of "green" and "energy efficient" residential property An empirical survey based on data from New Zealand
T2  - PROPERTY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the buyer awareness and acceptance of environmental and energy efficiency measures in the New Zealand residential property markets. This study aims to provide a greater understanding of consumer behaviour in the residential property market in relation to green housing issues
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on an extensive survey of Christchurch real estate offices and was designed to gather data on the factors that were considered important by buyers in the residential property market. The survey was designed to allow these factors to be analysed on a socio-economic basis and to compare buyer behaviour based on property values.
   Findings - The results show that regardless of income levels, buyers still consider that the most important factor in the house purchase decision is the location of the property and price. Although the awareness of green housing issues and energy efficiency in housing is growing in the residential property market, it is only a major consideration for young and older buyers in the high income brackets and is only of some importance for all other buyer sectors of the residential property market. Many of the voluntary measures introduced by Governments to improve the energy efficiency of residential housing are still not considered important by buyers, indicating that a more mandatory approach may have to be undertaken to improve energy efficiency in the established housing market, as these measures are not valued by the buyer.
   Originality/value - The paper confirms the variations in real estate buyer behaviour across the full range of residential property markets and the acceptance and awareness of green housing issues and measures. These results would be applicable to most established and transparent residential property markets.

AB  - Recently, network architectures based on high-density cells with reduced transmit power have been claimed as a promising solution for energy efficiency enhancement. Cell size reduction down to the range 10-50m is the paradigm of femtocells, based on low-cost, user-deployed in-house base stations connected to the operator's core network through DSL links. However, in dense urban scenarios, radio interference arising from multiple femtocells sharing the same spectrum can result in detrimental throughput degradation, with the straightforward consequence of increasing the effective amount of consumed energy per delivered information bit. In this paper, capitalizing on the Distributed Antennas System (DAS) paradigm, we propose a new Wireless over Cable architecture for femtocells (named FemtoWoC architecture) as a green solution that prevents the need of xDSL equipments for connections over cable, and enhances throughput performances through centralized resource management and interference mitigation for multiple femtocells. Benefits of the FemtoWoC solution with respect to the conventional scheme are investigated through simulations by accounting for a realistic LTE cellular deployment.

TI  - Housing, energy cost, and the poor: Counteracting effects in Germany's housing allowance program
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Adequate housing and affordable warmth are essential human needs, the lack of which may seriously harm people's health. Germany provides an allowance to low-income households, covering the housing as well as the space heating cost, to protect people from the consequences of poor housing conditions and fuel poverty. In order to limit public expenditures, payment recipients are required to choose low-cost dwellings, with the consequence that they probably occupy flats with a poor thermal performance. Recipients might therefore exhibit a lower per-square meter rent but in turn are likely to have a higher energy consumption and energy expenditures. Using a large data set of German households, this paper demonstrates that this financially counteracting effect is of negligible magnitude. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CP  - Proceedings of 2010 International Conference of Asia Pacific Network for Housing Research
AB  - Nowadays, low - carbon economy is energetically promoted all over the world, human being's notions of survival and development have been changed fundamentally with the efficient use of energy, the application of emission-reducing technology, the upgrade of industrial structure and the innovation of systems. There exists great potential of emission reduction in real estate market, to implement less carbon emissions and pollution of the construction industry is important to both controlling energy consumption of buildings and achieving low-carbon economy society, therefore, green real estate attracts more and more attentions of the community. However, in the moment, the green real estate is still in its infancy in China and faces many problems, such as the lack of momentum in investing in energy efficiency housing, without clear awareness of green real estate and lake of effective political stimulus.
   This paper firstly analyzes the characteristics of green residence and its current extension pattern in China. It also presents experience reference from developed countries. By means of questionnaire investigation of the potential purchasers and role analysis on developers and government, this paper also puts forward countermeasures to promote the popularization of green residence.

CP  - Conference on Central Europe towards Sustainable Building
AB  - This paper reports the results of a study on the cost implications of achieving greater energy efficiency as measured by House Energy Rating(HER) 'stars' for new housing in Austalia. The results revealed that standard and currently available technologies, such a reflective foil barriers, increased insulation and low emissivity 'e' type glazing provide a means to achieving 6 star ratings at a relatively modest additional cost above the current 5 star standard.
   A further simple cost/benefit analysis reveals that operational savings from predicted reduction in annual energy demand show a payback period for the additional investment in achieving the new 6 star standard of approximately 25 years.

TI  - Two models for benchmarking UK domestic delivered energy
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - From publicly available data, two simple models are developed to help identify the trajectory of total delivered energy to UK households and provide benchmarks for the UK domestic sector. Both models can help to inform policy-makers and the public whether delivered energy in the domestic sector is on track and whether the reductions correspond with the expected impact of a more efficient domestic sector. The annual delivered energy, price, and temperature (ADEPT) model uses multiple linear regression to fit consumption data since 1970 (R(2) = 0.76). Findings indicate that with typical recent heating season temperatures of 7 degrees C and at 2005 energy prices, average household delivered energy is estimated at 21.7 MWh (95% confidence interval = 20.8, 22.6). For every 1 degrees C increase in heating season temperature, average household delivered energy drops by approximately 1 MWh/year. Energy price elasticity is estimated at -0.2, so that a 50% rise in energy prices corresponds to an approximate 10% decline in energy demand. To fit quarterly delivered energy data since 1998, a seasonal temperature energy price (STEP) model is also developed using polynomial multiple regression (R(2) > 0.99). At 2005 energy prices, the average household has a minimum power demand of 1.2 kW (including approximately 0.4 kW electricity) at about 16 degrees C, which rises as external temperatures drop to 5 degrees C, where it begins to plateau at approximately 3.8 kW. The average heat loss coefficient is estimated at 240-320 W/degrees C. Both models find no evidence to date to indicate that changes in delivered energy are beyond those expected due to variations in external temperature and energy price. The seasonal model also provides benchmarks for delivered energy as a response to external temperature and energy price that will be useful for a comparison of building performance evaluations with the national stock, without requiring data for a whole year.

TI  - Real Estate and Facilities Management Alignment to Business Needs: A Conceptual Model
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2010 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION AND REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT, VOLS 1-3
CP  - 2010 International Conference on Construction and Real Estate Management
AB  - Growing international recognition of the important role of real estate facilities as a business resource has led to a more prominent profile of facilities management (FM) as a business practice and as a profession that can contribute to business success. globalisation of markets and supply chains, rapid technological advances and shifting management priorities have altered both the provision and management of corporate facilities and associated support services. To this end organizations have pursued various strategies aimed at better matching between demand and supply, extended the scope for outsourcing, taken energy efficiency measures and introduced more technology solutions; all efforts to better control and manage facilities occupancy costs. FM performance, both in terms of having appropriate real estate facilities and appropriate support services, are keys to support the achievement of corporate goals. This paper proposes a conceptual model for evaluating variables that are critical in aligning FM to corporate business plans. The model is based on identifying an initial four key alignment variables (business needs, facilities solutions, FM services and FM resources) for which alignment criteria can be developed and used to evaluate the degree of alignment between each pair of alignment variables. Further work is being undertaken to validate these variables and alignment criteria as well as to identify any other alignment variables and associated criteria.

TI  - METHODOLOGY FOR REAL ESTATE APPRAISAL OF GREEN VALUE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - Green buildings are considered a quick and effective approach to protect the environment by slowing down the consumption rate of primary energy resources and by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, appraisals of properties should take into consideration this new feature of buildings by implementing data from Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) into real estate assessment. With this respect, a methodology is proposed and analyzed to be considered in the sales comparison real estate valuation process. The originality of the methodology consists of considering the expected costs of the so-called wasted/saved energy as a proxy for depreciations/appreciations of the value of the building due to the obsolete/better energy efficiency. Wasted/saved energy is considered to be the difference between the energy demand of a reference building and the energy demand of the subject property.

T2  - ASHRAE TRANSACTIONS 2009, VOL 115, PT 1
CP  - Winter Meeting of the American-Society-of-Heating-Refrigerating-and-Air-Conditioning-Engineers
AB  - A house was constructed in Carbondale, IL, in the mixed humid climate region, using the best current construction methods with commonly available materials. Good passive solar characteristics were obtained by properly orientating the house to have many south-facing windows with proper overhangs which provided 23% of the energy needed for heating. The house also included 15 cm (6 in) thick insulated walls, insulated concrete forms for foundation walls, insulated rim joist, a ground-source heat pump, Energy-Star windows, clothes washer refrigerator and compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs).
   Electrical usage data was metered separately for heating, air conditioning, hot water, lights and appliances. The energy used by the actual house was compared to the same sized house built to the International Energy Code Council 2004 Residential Energy Code. The actual house used 7809 kWh (50%) less than the code house for an annual cost savings of $826. The annual on-site electricity used by the house was 19.8 kWh/m(2). Cost of the energy-efficient improvements in the actual house was $7,990. The house was very cost-effective by using commercially available materials and employing an on-site general contractor knowledgeable in maintaining the high energy-efficiency standards designed into the house, coordinating the work, and allowing the homeowners to perform manual tasks. This method resulted in a price of $1,062/m(2) ($99/ft(2)) of finished floor area, noticeably less than a comparable house in the region.

TI  - Thermal behaviour and ventilation efficiency of a low-cost passive solar energy efficient house
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB  - Low-cost houses in South Africa are characterized by poor craftsmanship and design with no regard to energy efficient passive solar design features resulting in high electrical energy consumption, uncomfortable indoor thermal environment and poor ventilation efficiency. Incorporating energy efficiency passive solar design strategies and correct material choice can significantly reduce energy consumption in buildings. This paper presents the effects of fly ash to brick properties, thermal comfort analysis and the impact of the ventilation components to the indoor environment of a low-cost energy efficient passive solar house constructed using fly ash bricks. The addition of fly ash to clay improved brick properties. The house was monitored for a period covering all the South African seasons. In summer, the passive solar house was found to be thermally comfortable for 66% of the period monitored, while for winter it was about 79%. Windows were found to have a higher impact on the ventilation rates than doors. The indoor carbon dioxide concentration monitored over night was found to be 0.248%, which is less than the maximum range limit of 0.500%. The performance of the house was seen to depend on how the occupants operate the house. The house was found to create a thermally comfortable indoors environment and experienced minimal temperature and humidity swings, with a better performance in winter than summer.

TI  - Energy-using appliances and energy-saving features: Determinants of ownership in Ireland
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - Energy usage and energy efficiency are of increasing concern in Ireland. Regression analyses on a large household micro-dataset reveal that those homes that have more energy-saving features are also likely to have a high 'potential energy use'. Statistically significant dwelling features include location, value and dwelling type, while household features such as income, age, period of residency, social status and tenure type are also important.

TI  - Monetary benefits of preventing childhood lead poisoning with lead-safe window replacement
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Previous estimates of childhood lead poisoning prevention benefits have quantified the present value of some health benefits, but not the costs of lead paint hazard control or the benefits associated with housing and energy markets. Because older housing with lead paint constitutes the main exposure source today in the US, we quantify health benefits, costs, market value benefits, energy savings, and net economic benefits of lead-safe window replacement (which includes paint stabilization and other measures). The benefit per resident child from improved lifetime earnings alone is $21,195 in pre-1940 housing and $8685 in 1940-59 housing (in 2005 dollars). Annual energy savings are $130-486 per housing unit, with or without young resident children, with an associated increase in housing market value of $5900-14,300 per housing unit, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Net benefits are $4490-5,629 for each housing unit built before 1940, and $491-1629 for each unit built from 1940-1959, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Lead-safe window replacement in all pre-1960 US housing would yield net benefits of at least $67 billion, which does not include many other benefits. These other benefits, which are shown in this paper, include avoided Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, other medical costs of childhood lead exposure, avoided special education, and reduced crime and juvenile delinquency in later life. In addition, such a window replacement effort would reduce peak demand for electricity, carbon emissions from power plants, and associated long-term costs of climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - How consumers value healthy houses: a preliminary segmentation of Canadian households
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
AB  - As part of a larger research project which examined the concept of healthy houses in Canada, this study provides a preliminary assessment of potential segments of Canadian householders based on their attitudes about two indoor environmental quality (IEQ) attributes (indoor air quality and lighting). Additionally, concerns about energy efficiency in the home are also addressed. A nationwide survey of households (n = 784) was conducted to search for indications of segments of Canadian householders that value their homes' indoor environments and energy efficiency, thus addressing issues of consumer interest for healthier homes. Similar groups of householders were derived based on their levels of agreement with a variety of statements regarding some indoor environmental quality attributes and energy efficiency. The specific goals were: (1) to identify segments within Canada which indicate the presence of potential consumers of healthier houses on a broader scale; and (2) to characterize these groups using attitudinal and demographic variables. Segmentation in this study was conducted using a k-means cluster analysis, with the clusters being characterized using demographic and attitudinal information. Results indicated that there is indeed an identifiable segment within the Canadian housing sector for products and services associated with the healthy housing concept. Although housing and policy recommendations are not explicitly made, both private and public stakeholders in the Canadian housing sector could benefit by taking note of these findings.

TI  - Potentials and costs of carbon dioxide mitigation in the world's buildings
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Buildings are responsible for over a third of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. A significant share of these emissions can be avoided cost effectively through improved energy efficiency, while providing the same or higher level of energy services. How large is this emission reduction potential globally and how much will it cost for society to unlock it? This paper provides answers to these questions, presenting the results of bottom-up research conducted for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on the assessment of 80 country- or regional-level mitigation studies throughout the world. First, the paper analyses the findings of these studies in a common framework. Then, it aggregates their results into a global estimate of CO2 mitigation potential. The paper concludes that by 2020 it is possible to cut cost effectively approximately 29% of buildings-related global CO2 emissions, the largest among all sectors reported by the IPCC, representing a 3.2GtCO(2)eq. reduction. Developing countries house the largest cost-effective potential with up to 52% of building-level emissions, whereas transition economies and industrialised countries have cost-effective potentials of up to 37% and 25%, respectively. Energy-efficient lighting was identified as the most attractive measure worldwide, in terms of both reduction potential and cost effectiveness. If this potential is realised, the building-related CO2 emissions would stay constant over 2004-2030. These stabilisation levels (if achieved by all other sectors) would cancel about 3 degrees C temperature increase over the projected period of time. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A software-to-hardware self-mapping technique to enhance program throughput for portable multimedia workloads
T2  - DELTA 2008: FOURTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ELECTRONIC DESIGN, TEST AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 4th IEEE International Symposium on Electronic Design, Test and Applications
AB  - Continuously increasing demand for richer functionality, faster real-time communication, smaller feature size, longer battery life, more elevated security, and higher reliability is pushing the design for portable multimedia applications into the era where a single system is consisted of a general-purpose CPU interacting with several application-specific accelerating components and co-processors to fulfill the ever diverse constraints imposed multi-directionally. The inter-component communication overhead, along with the engineering efforts required to integrate, verify, and validate such heterogeneous systems are scaled disproportionally as the complexity of such systems continue rising skyrocketedly. Moreover, due to limited instruction encoding space and the need to maintain back-ward compatibly in the future designs, designers are often forced to include only a very small subset of the total desired functionalities on chip, despite there can be more than sufficient silicon real estate to incorporate these specialized operation units. This paper proposes a cost-effective technique of incorporating diverse functionalities into a single versatile hardware acceleration unit, called VPU, to replace the conventional ALU on a CPU. The proposed VPU can supply the general-purpose CPU with a rich set of operations, which may supersede some or even all of the heterogeneous cores. The superseded hardware components are removed to reduce the integration and communication overhead. The issues of limited instruction encoding space and future backward compatibility are resolved by our proposed dynamic instruction re-mapping technique, in which the instruction bit fields can be redefined on the fly to allow instruction space reuse at run time.

TI  - Economic Advantages of Applying Model Predictive Control to Distributed Energy Resources: The Case of Micro-CHP Systems
T2  - 2008 MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON CONTROL AUTOMATION, VOLS 1-4
CP  - 16th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation
AB  - The increasing presence of distributed energy resources, information, and intelligence in the electricity infrastructure increases the possibilities for larger economic efficiency of power systems. This work shows the possible cost advantages of applying a model predictive control (MPC) strategy to residential energy systems. MPC can take future information on energy demand and prices into account and might lead to lower energy costs for end consumers. The main objective in this paper is to illustrate the potential for operational cost savings when adopting MPC in the local control of residential energy systems, thereby mainly focusing on micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) systems. We conclude that the pricing regime of household energy has a large influence on potential cost savings.

TI  - Perspectives on implementing energy efficiency in existing Swedish detached houses
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - In this study, we first analyse energy-efficiency measures in existing electrically heated houses in Sweden from a societal economic perspective. Measures to a house envelopes and to energy supply chains are evaluated through a system analysis approach and we include the external costs of climate change and the effect of different Swedish climatic zones. We find that in a typical house from the 1970s, conversion from electric heating is highly motivated since the mitigation cost of conversion is lower than the estimated external costs of emitted CO2. Both conversions and house envelope measures are more motivated in the northern part of the country, where there is a higher heat demand. A successful implementation of changes requires them to be attractive for consumers to adopt. We therefore secondly analyse the economic conditions for Swedish house owners to implement societal economic cost-efficient measures. We include the economic influence of an investment subsidy for heating system conversion, an income tax deduction for changing windows, customer electricity tax, real estate tax and of the cost of purchased energy from different energy suppliers. Apart from the economics, several other factors affect a house owner's decision to change heating systems. We therefore thirdly analyse house owners' perceptions of different heating supply alternatives based on the results of two comprehensive questionnaires. These different perspectives are combined in a discussion whether the studied policy instruments encourage house owners to implement changes in accordance with the energy-efficiency goals of decision makers. We find that the investment subsidy could be useful to break the lock-in effect of resistance heaters, which house owners seemed to experience. The electricity tax makes heating systems in line with national goals more competitive and efficiency measures to the house envelope more profitable. The reduction of the electricity tax in the northern part of the country has the opposite effect. Also, the increase in real estate tax when implementing energy-efficiency measures gives a contradictory message. The price differences between energy suppliers has a larger impact on the house owners' economic conditions than both subsidies and tax rate changes, and possibly also affect the house owner's attitudes towards various systems.

TI  - Implementation of energy efficiency in residential areas - Public policies versus energy suppliers
T2  - FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BUILDING ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT, PROCEEDINGS VOLS 1-3
CP  - 1st International Conference on Building Energy and Environment (COBEE 2008)
AB  - In order to realise the potential for energy efficiency in residential areas it requires influencing the many individual house owners that make the decisions. We compare how Swedish energy policy and Swedish energy suppliers influence the house owners in taking decisions about heating systems and house envelope measures. An economic analysis shows how energy policy and electricity cost affects the house owners' economic situation. The house owners' perception is analysed through comprehensive questionnaires, sent out both before and after the implementation of a heating system conversion subsidy and a district heating marketing campaign by an energy supplier. We conclude that a heating system conversion subsidy and electricity tax give relevant incentives to act according to the national policy. We show that the effect on the annual cost of most of the studied policy measures was smaller than the price variations between different energy suppliers. The energy supplier can largely influence both the economic situation and the perceptions of the customers.

TI  - Innovation in Homebuilding and the Future of Housing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION
AB  - Problem: The future of housing depends in part on innovation by homebuilders. Planners should know how to influence innovation in homebuilding in order to promote innovative practices that conserve the environment, improve quality, and reduce costs.
   Purpose: This article explains challenges involved in innovation in home building, as well as providing planners with strategies to influence innovation in the industry.
   Methods: I review the literature and identify sources of resistance to or acceptance of innovation in home building. I also report the results of two national surveys of innovation adoption and use regression analysis to test variables likely to inhibit or promote innovation.
   Results and conclusions: Small builders receptive to innovation are likely to be led by a technology champion and to build custom homes for a relatively affluent and informed clientele. These firms provide a likely audience for technology innovations that require more upfront investment, as with some green building products, but can be marketed as highly innovative to home-buyers interested in higher performance in energy efficiency, sustainability or durability. In order to impact a larger portion of the housing market, large production builders should be the target for innovations that contribute to affordability in entry-level homes or to energy efficiency, sustainability and durability in higher priced houses.
   Takeaway for practice: Planners aiming to encourage innovation in homebuilding should craft strategies that recognize the opportunities, the structure of the industry, and the factors influencing innovation adoption. Local builders with owners who champion innovation are good targets for demonstration programs that involve custom homes. Larger production builders will want strategies that can be replicated in multiple market areas, and are likely to avoid localities whose codes and regulations would require them to change their production models.

TI  - Responsible property investment criteria developed using the Delphi Method
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - This paper helps define responsible property investing (RPI) by using the Delphi Method to prioritize criteria for the evaluation of property investments. An international panel from the real estate and social investing sectors evaluated 66 criteria in terms of materiality to investors and importance to the public interest. A moderate to strong level of consensus was achieved. Criteria were ranked in terms of their materiality for financial performance and their importance to the public interest. Top ranked criteria were energy efficiency and conservation, high level of public transport services, transit-oriented development, daylight and natural ventilation, and contributes to higher density, mixed-use walkable places. There were few to no significant differences among the panellists by industry, gender or nationality. Factor analysis uncovered ten dimensions underlying the criteria. Based on this analysis, the panel would emphasize the creation of less automobile-dependent and more energy-efficient cities where worker well-being and urban revitalization are priorities. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating tools were compared with the results and found to be much stronger on environmental criteria than social concerns. The results can guide RPI portfolio audits, database development, third-party assessments of property companies, strategic consulting, the development of corporate reporting standards, RPI certification procedures, updated green building assessment tools, and cost-benefit studies to help guide asset managers.

TI  - Residential implementation of critical-peak pricing of electricity
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - This paper investigates how critical-peak pricing (CPP) affects households with different usage and income levels, with the goal of informing policy makers who are considering the implementation of CPP tariffs in the residential sector. Using a subset of data from the California Statewide Pricing Pilot of 2003-04, average load change during summer events, annual percent bill change, and post-experiment satisfaction ratings are calculated across six customer segments, categorized by historical usage and income levels. Findings show that hi.-h-use customers respond significantly more in kW reduction than do low-use customers, while low-use customers save significantly more in percentage reduction of annual electricity bills than do high-use customers-results that challenge the strategy of targeting only high-use customers for CPP tariffs. Across income levels, average load and bill changes were statistically indistinguishable, as were satisfaction rates-results that are compatible with a strategy of full-scale implementation of CPP rates in the residential sector. Finally, the high-use customers earning less than $50,000 annually were the most likely of the groups to see bill increases-about 5% saw bill increases of 10% or more-suggesting that any residential CPP implementation might consider targeting this customer group for increased energy efficiency efforts.

TI  - Determinants of residential space heating expenditures in Germany
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - We first examine the determinants of household expenditures on space heating and hot water supply in Germany. A number of socio-economic characteristics of households are included along with building characteristics. Our analysis covers information on more than 12,000 households in Germany for the years 1998 and 2003.
   The analysis continues by investigating whether different kinds of households are affected differently by increases in energy prices. Households in owner-occupied properties are less affected compared to those in rented accommodation, this could be because owners are more likely to have installed energy-efficient heating and hot water supply systems and landlords have less of an incentive to improve the conditions of their rented accommodations. An energy policy targeting especially the latter group might benefit not only households in rented accommodation, but might also increase energy-efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well.

TI  - An ex-ante evaluation of a White Certificates scheme in The Netherlands: A case study for the household sector
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Increased efficiency of energy demand is generally recognized as a very cost-effective strategy to reduce energy requirements and the related environmental impacts (e.g. the greenhouse effect). In order to improve energy efficiency the use of innovative market mechanisms, such as the White Certificates (WhC), has been proposed. The basic idea underlying this policy instrument is that specific energy saving targets are set for energy suppliers or energy distributors. These requirements must be fulfilled in a predefined time frame. The focus of this paper is on the effect on energy efficiency improvement, on the behavior of the end consumers and the market of energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, we study the possible effects of WhC in The Netherlands by means of a theoretical analysis and an empirical bottom-up model. We compare concrete energy efficient technologies in terms of cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency improvement. In combination with existing Dutch policies for energy efficiency improvement in the built environment, the contribution of this innovative scheme could enhance the accomplishment of energy efficiency targets. In this paper, two packages of energy saving measures of a WhC scheme are studied for Dutch households. The costs of these technologies are estimated through the use of different discount rates, which imply overcoming of the market barriers through the use of the WhC. A scheme that includes all available technologies as flexible options appears as a realistic solution and can generate cost effectively up to 180 PJ primary energy savings and 4550 ME cumulative net savings in the year 2020, at a discount rate of 5%, under the precondition that the policy and administrative costs can be kept low.

CP  - 10th Conference of the International-Building-Performance-Simulation-Association
AB  - Residential Building Energy Efficiency (RBEE) becomes more important in recent years in China. From 1986, Chinese government has carried out a series of codes of RBEE, but for kinds of reasons, the effect is not perfect enough. One important reason is
   In order to promote the development of RBEE, an energy labeling system was presented in this paper. In this labeling system, the real estate company was requested to label the energy consumption data of the houses to be sold on the sales documents, and show this data to the consumers. With propagandistic and economical ways, government needs to guide the consumers to select energy efficient houses. In further, the real estate company will be driven by the market to build more energy efficient houses and apartments, and correlative products and research will be promoted. So, the energy labeling system is a system that accelerates the development of RBEE with the power of market.
   Some key problems were also discussed in this paper, such as, the scale of the labeling objectives, and the type of label. This paper also point out that the data of label should come from simulation, but not measurement or expert. The operation mechanism was also presented, which include how to do the simulation, how to ensure the accuracy of labeling data, etc.

TI  - Dynamics of technology shifts in the household sector-implications for clean development mechanism
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
CP  - 2nd Asian Energy Conference
AB  - The present paper attempts to analyse the dynamics of energy end-use technology shifts in the household sector in India. The technology shifts can be categorized as naturally occurring shifts (with increasing household incomes and availability of energy carriers) and policy-induced shifts (by creating a favourable environment). Initially, the households energy usage patterns, types of energy carriers and the technologies in use are analysed using the data from the National Sample Survey (1999-2000). The energy consumption is disaggregated according to end-use activity and by income groups for rural as well as urban households. It is observed that large variations in energy use exist across different sections of households-urban/rural, low/high-income groups, etc. Further, the paper provides a methodological framework for the diffusion of energy-efficient technologies, and the implications of such diffusions for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). It analyses the reasons for the gap between possible and practical implementation of energy-efficient measures, study the reasons for households not using the cost-effective technologies available to them, the benefits of innovation of energy efficiency, and the required policies and specific proposals for government intervention to achieve the potential for the CDM.

AB  - Key elements of present investment decision-making regarding energy efficiency of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings are the marginal costs of energy efficiency measures and incomplete knowledge of investors and architects about pricing, co-benefits and new technologies. This paper reports on a recently completed empirical study for the Swiss residential sector. It empirically quantifies the marginal costs of energy efficiency investments (i.e. additional insulation, improved window systems, ventilation and heating systems and architectural concepts). For the private sector, first results on the economic valuation of co-benefits such as improved comfort of living, improved indoor air quality, better protection against external noise, etc. may amount to the same order of magnitude as the energy-related benefits are given. The cost-benefit analysis includes newly developed technologies that show large variations in prices due to pioneer market pricing, add-on of learning costs and risk components of the installers. Based on new empirical data on the present cost-situation and past techno-economic progress, the potential of future cost reduction was estimated applying the experience curve concept. The paper shows, for the first time, co-benefits and cost dynamics of energy efficiency investments, of which decision makers in the real estate sector, politics and administrations are scarcely aware.

TI  - Policy deficiencies in promoting building energy efficiency in mainland China
T2  - Proceedings of CRIOCM 2006 International Research Symposium on Advancement of Construction Management and Real Estate, Vols 1 and 2
CP  - International Research Symposium on Advancement of Construction Management and Real Estate
AB  - China has set sustainable development as one of its basic national policies. Because energy consumption in the construction industry accounts for a distinct part of the total social energy consumption, it attracts more attention than before. Many laws, ministry regulations, construction standards related to construction energy efficiency have been set in recent years. However, data from recent official investigations shows that most construction activities in mainland China, both new buildings and existing ones, do not meet the energy efficiency requirements. This paper analyses the reasons from three aspects, all of which are related to public regulations. First, the pricing mechanism and supply system of energy remain a strong characteristic of a planned economy. This non-market orientation weakens consumers' attention to energy consumption expenditure, which discourages them to buy the high-price energy-efficient buildings. Second, in a flourishing real estate market, the developers have no economic incentives to provide the high-cost energy-efficient buildings; also, they do not have such pressure from public regulations. Third, the information asymmetry in the energy-efficient building market leads to a Lemon Market. The study also identifies other deficiencies in the policy mechanism, especially the legal system, to promote building energy efficiency in Mainland China.

TI  - Justifying sustainable buildings - championing green operations
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE REAL ESTATE
AB  - Purpose - A fundamental contribution that a corporate real estate (CRE) manager can make to the industry and to the world is the sincere attempt to implement green operations within their buildings portfolio. Reducing an organization's environmental impact is a strategic issue that not only reaches across each constituent part of its own operations and activities, but extends to include those of its suppliers and those who use its goods and services. Facility and real estate managers can demonstrate their value by participating in formulating and implementing policies for reducing the organization's environmental impact, redefining their role as one that underpins mainstream organizational and business needs, and bringing value to their organization while positively impacting the global environment. This paper seeks to address these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - A review of current literature on the topic of sustainability and the background of the sustainability movement in the US was undertaken to develop key findings.
   Findings - Organizations that adopt environmental responsibility and then take action are capable of building more secure and prosperous positions within the global economy. Five significant factors were found to endorse the business case for sustainable building design and operation. These include resource efficiency, energy efficiency, pollution prevention, harmonization with the environment, and integrated and systemic approaches, including environmental management systems.
   Practical implications - Since, real estate is a fixed capital investment, any improvement to the asset should be considered, especially one as significant as sustainability efforts that also contribute to improved organizational impact.
   Originality/value - Considering the reality of financial pressures, this paper attempts to provide background and information for managers to develop their own sustainability objectives to improve the value of CRE assets.

TI  - CEPHEUS results: measurements and occupants' satisfaction provide evidence for Passive Houses being an option for sustainable building
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Passive houses offer extended living comfort with only 15-20% of the space heating demand of conventional new buildings while the extra costs of this standard are only about 10% of the total building costs. In the first part of this paper, detailed measurements for 11 "Passive House" projects with more than 100 dwelling units from the EU-funded demonstration project CEPHEUS (Cost Efficient Passive Houses as European Standards) are presented.
   All projects exhibit extraordinarily low space heat consumptions. Compared with ordinary, newly erected buildings, 80% of the space heat consumption could be saved. The total primary energy consumption (including household electricity) was less than 50% of that of conventional new buildings. The measurements show that the buildings also offer comfortable indoor conditions in both summer and winter.
   Several social research studies revealed that the users are well pleased with their homes. The second part of the paper focuses on low-income tenant's satisfaction in the world's first multi-story Passive Houses in Kassel, Germany. This building contrasts sharply with the "standard" Passive House, occupied by its owners. A 2.5 year study was conducted from spring of 2000 to autumn of 2002. The development of opinions, attitudes, behaviour, and satisfaction over time could be recorded. The building is a clear success, the tenant's satisfaction is high.
   It is concluded that this building type fulfils the conditions of sustainability in social, ecological and economic respects and should therefore be disseminated on a larger scale. To this end, the last part of the paper describes the development of the Passive House standard in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, from the first demonstration project in 1991 to about 3500 dwelling units today. The prerequisites for this development are analysed. Finally, the authors give their view about the political possibilities for pushing Passive Houses into the market as well as for stimulating a market pull for this comfortable and energy efficient building type.

TI  - Multi-agent behavior evolutionary analysis on building energy efficiency economic incentive system in China based on cellular automata
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT SCIENCE & ENGINEERING (13TH), VOLS 1-3
CP  - 13th International Conference on Management Science and Engineering
AB  - Building energy efficiency (BEE) economic incentive system is an enormous system of multi-agent, which includes government departments, design institutes, construction units, real estate development enterprises, purchasers and energy service companies etc. It has a widely internal relationship and a character of multi-layer, multi-function, dynamic, open and mutually learning, so it is conformed that this system has the basic character of complex system. As a rational method to solve the problem of complex system, Cellular Automata (CA) can analyze the grid dynamic model which is not only discrete in temporal and spatial aspects but also partial in temporal consequence and spatial mutual relationship. Under some certain simple units and regulations, CA can simulate the complex system veritably. With the bottom-up modeling method of CA, this study. establishes an evolutionary model of multi-agent for BEE economic incentive system in China through analyzing the complex character of this system. Based on the analytic result of evolving processes, it is recognized that the influence factors of promoting BEE economic incentive policy involves behavior preference, macro environment factors and different, actual conditions of local regions.

TI  - Willingness to pay and preferences for healthy home attributes in Canada
T2  - FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL
AB  - This study examined aspects of the "healthful living" concept in the Canadian housing market. This project focused on identifying what Canadian householders value and desire in the indoor environment of their homes, particularly with respect to the indoor air quality, lighting, and acoustics. A nationwide survey consisting of 3,592 Canadian households was conducted, revolving around issues of consumer demand for healthier homes. The major topics assessed were: 1) willingness to pay for better indoor environmental quality; and 2) householder choices and preferences for healthful living attributes. Modeling using logistic regression was conducted to determine whether the likelihood of paying more for better indoor environmental quality features could be predicted. Products and materials promoting energy efficiency, natural light, better insulation, and nonallergic qualities were preferred in a choice/preference question of nine attributes regarding healthier homes. There seem to be market opportunities for the healthy home concept to establish itself in the Canadian housing sector, which may serve to benefit the Canadian wood industry.

T2  - IABSE Conference New Delhi, India 2005: ROLE OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS TOWARDS REDUCTION OF POVERTY
CP  - Conference of the International-Association-for-Bridge-and-Structural Engineering
AB  - Sustainable building materials, especially natural ones are generally low -cost compared to manufactured materials, thus sustainable building materials are lower in embodied energy and toxicity than man-made ones. They require less processing and are less damaging to the environment. Consequently, traditional architecture, all over the world, depended basically upon building materials available in the contiguous environment. These local materials are better suited to environmental conditions and purchases support area economies, like adobe, stone and palm trunks, which are theoretically renewable besides their efficient thermal performance. Sustainable building materials are usually part of society sustainable development for they often depend on local labor and available raw resources, which means that building with sustainable building materials contribute in housing affordability, offering in the same time, more employment opportunities. This leads to reduce poverty levels in many countries in the world.
   This paper aims to study the factor of choosing building materials that conform to the Gulf region, as an entrance for developing the process of facilitated housing, and illustrating the role of its contribution in rationalizing consumption of power sources. Use of sustainable building materials achieves the economic objective, which is reducing the initial and operating costs of housing utilities and making it affordable within the economic power and the same time minimizing air toxicity and environment pollution.

TI  - Architecture of an energy independent house in the County Splitsko-dalmatinska
T2  - Energy and the Environment 2004, Vol II
CP  - 19th International Congress on Energy and the Environment
AB  - The concept of an energy independent house intended for rural tourism on islands represents a model for designing houses in. rural areas lacking a developed utility infrastructure network. The high quality of construction and a high level of the external building envelope (including the orientation of the house and an adequate relationship between the surface area and the building's volume) have reduced transmission and ventilation losses to a minimum. Additional insulation of the external building envelope raises the construction costs by 10-12 per cent and reduces heat losses through the house's envelope tenfold (from approximately 150 kWh/m(2) a year to less than 15 kWh/m(2)). The use of renewable energy sources for heating and electricity increases the costs of installing the energy supply system in the house and makes the construction in general more expensive by some 30 per cent. However, taking into account that no conventional heating system (and associated maintenance costs) is any longer necessary, that annual heat consumption of such a house is below 15 kWh/m(2) (total energy consumption is below 40 kWh/m(2)), the concept of a house self-sufficient in terms of energy becomes absolutely cost-effective in the short and in the long run. The system is even more cost-effective if such houses are grouped in villages or settlements of 8-10 houses, when the major part of the energy supply system may be provided from a central source. Viewing the past activities related to deliberations about energy future of the County Splitsko-dalmatinska, an ecological house, self-sufficient in terms of energy, as an element of an autonomous solar village intended for rural tourism on islands is a logical continuation of a practical implementation of research results regarding energy development of the County. Its islands show an extremely great potential for the development of eco-tourism and organic agriculture. An energy independent ecological house, located in a rural area with no utility infrastructure, combined with renewable energy sources, represents a model for a successful fulfilment of strategic development determinants of the County Splitsko-dalmatinska.

TI  - Renewable energy for passive house heating Part I. Building description
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - A passive house is a cost-efficient building that can manage throughout the heating period, due to its specific construction design, with more than 10 times less heat energy than the same building designed to standards presently applicable across Europe. Its extended thermal insulation and enhanced air-tightness removes the need for temperatures higher than 50 degreesC. This makes renewable energy sources particularly suitable for heating, cooling and domestic hot water production. Modeling of renewable energy usage for space heating requires as a preliminary stage the detailed description of the building structure, of the HVAC equipment and of the internal heat sources. This paper shows the main data used to model the thermal behavior of a passive house. Details about Pirmasens Passive House (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany) are given, as for example, the internal heat sources, including electric appliances, heat and humidity released by human bodies, thermal internal facilities as hot and cold water pipes. All these are quantified by using statistically derived data. A detailed time schedule for a standard German family with two adults and two children was prepared. It takes into account the national celebrations, vacation and weekends among others. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Housing conditions, energy efficiency, affordability and satisfaction with housing: A Pan-European analysis
T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - Energy-efficiency levels in housing vary considerably across Europe. Poor energy efficiency results in a number of social problems, including fuel poverty and ill health, as well as excess energy consumption which leads to high levels of energy-related environmental emissions; the policy context for these air pollutants is now well established. In light of these policy-drivers, this paper presents a cross-country analysis of housing conditions, energy-efficiency levels, affordability and satisfaction with housing in 14 European countries using longitudinal datasets from the European Community Household Panel for the years 1994-97. Very little empirical analysis of European housing conditions has been undertaken previously. The results indicate the existence of three main typologies in Europe as regards housing conditions, with serious housing deprivation in southern Europe, in terms of poor thermal efficiency, high fuel poverty, burdensome housing costs and low housing-satisfaction rates. In northern Europe, problems of damp and overcrowding are found, especially in the UK, Ireland, France and Belgium. The policy implications of these findings are outlined.

TI  - Computation of variations in net profit due to energy efficiency measures
T2  - ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
CP  - 1st International Conference on Sustainable Energy, Planning and Technology in Relationship to the Environment
AB  - Savings from energy conservation can be evaluated on the basis of different measures, such as parameter studies, life cycle costing, and investment return in financial terms. In this paper, we report the development and evaluation of a tool for estimations of the return on financial investment in energy conservation.
   The tool was designed for evaluations in the design stage for commercial buildings. The method for calculating the investment return was based on three components: 1) An estimation of the building production cost. 2) A simulation of the energy use based on the building specification. 3) A traditional present value computation. From this calculation the investment return was calculated in terms of net profit, from the net rental income, property value and investment costs.
   The tool has been evaluated on the basis of data from completed buildings. These investigations indicated that the simulated energy use and building production costs were reliable. The tool has in addition been used and evaluated by HVAC-engineers and real estate developers at the company NCC AB in Sweden. Based on this evaluation it was concluded that the obtained method for illustrating the investment return capacity of energy conservation measures shows promising features for future use in discussions of energy efficiency in buildings.

TI  - High efficiency household appliances and low income families in Italy
T2  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES AND LIGHTING
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Energy Efficiency in Household Appliances and Lighting
AB  - With increasing globalisation of the economy, income distribution and consumer preferences are changing. This may impact upon the possibility for low-income families to purchase and utilise energy efficient home appliances.
   The aim of the study is to access the present degree of difficulty that low income families in Italy have in purchasing high efficiency refrigerator/freezers and clothes washers.
   Results show that, given their substantially lower level of expenditure for household appliances, the higher prices of energy efficient models represent an obstacle for these families in Italy to overcome energy inefficiency and energy poverty. an important input to energy policy. Over two million 600 thousand families, 11.9 percent of the total families in 1999 are estimated to be below the poverty threshold based upon consumption. An independent survey shows that these families possess less technologically advanced models, keeping them for a much longer period of 36 years, more than double the recommended lifetime of 15 years, and four times the national average of nine years. This technical disadvantage is aggravated by the additional operating costs of the more inefficient models. The higher prices of the more efficient models make it difficult for the poor families to afford them. Even at the annualised price of the average refrigerator - belonging to the energy efficiency C class - the annual expenditure of the poor families in Italy is less than half that necessary to purchase this model, consistent with the longer turnover rates. According to latest statistics in 1999, the B model is priced 70% above the C model in Italy, making it very difficult for poor families to purchase the more efficient models. Extrapolating the relative consumption data to other European countries and comparing it to local prices indicates that the situation may be similar in other EU Member States.
   The implications for energy and social policy are clear: without some form of public incentive it is unlikely that poor families in Italy will purchase the energy efficient models, remaining in an energy poverty trap for many years to come.

TI  - Estimating future elasticities of substitution for the rebound debate
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Because they lower the cost of using energy in production and consumption activities, energy efficiency improvements may lead to a rebound effect, in which the demand for energy increases to offset partly or completely the initial energy saving. The magnitude of the rebound effect depends on: (1) the extent to which the effective costs of energy services (capital and operating) actually decrease from efficiency improvements, (2) the technical and economic ease with which energy and other inputs to production and consumption (capital, labour, materials) can be substituted when the effective cost of using energy does in fact decrease, (3) the response of intermediate and final demands to changes in the cost of energy services (structural change), and (4) the response of energy service demand to changes in income. Estimates of (1) and (2) together, which is the elasticity of substitution (ESUB) between capital and energy, have been criticized in the past for either not being explicit about what is technically possible in future (critique of top-down) or ignoring the intangible costs facing firms and households when considering and implementing energy efficiency investments (critique of bottom-up). In this study, we attempt to address these two concerns by using a technologically explicit and behaviourally realistic, technology simulation model to estimate long-run, future ESUB values for capital and energy for the Canadian economy. Our simulations suggest that the capital-energy ESUB may be lower than assumed by most studies that ignore behaviour, suggesting only weak substitution between capital and energy. Ironically, this could mean that our energy efficiency efforts will be less effective than sometimes thought but that the rebound effect will also be relatively small. However, estimates of (3) and (4) must be combined with our findings to assess the full magnitude of the rebound effect. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Hong Kong Real Estate Developers Organisation have established a voluntary eco-labelling scheme for buildings in Hong Kong known as HK-BEAM (Hong Kong Building Environmental Assessment Method). It's use is as a tool to assess environmental impacts caused by buildings. It aims to encourage the adoption of more environmentally friendly building design. The assessment covers global, local and indoor issues. This paper reviews the benefits and difficulties of adopting this labelling scheme and highlights those areas where further work is needed to set international standards for the use of sustainable materials and increase the uptake of energy efficiency in building design and operation.

TI  - Energy efficiency and social equity in South Africa: seeking convergence
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - At the broadest level, one of the key challenges facing post-apartheid South Africa is to achieve a balance between equity and efficiency goals. On the one hand, the democratic government wishes to improve the quality of life of the majority of the population, whilst on the other, the country needs an efficient and internationally competitive economy. At the more specific level of household energy policy, this efficiency-equity linkage represents a key challenge for policy-making and implementation: it is essential that convergence is sought between household energy strategies aimed at improving energy efficiency, and those strategies which improve the living conditions of the poor. This paper begins by reviewing developments in South Africa's household energy sector in the early-1990s, most notably the national electrification plan which was launched in 1991. Despite the attention given to energy efficiency in the government's new energy policy, energy efficiency considerations have not yet emerged as a major force in the energy sector. A range of economic and institutional reasons for this are identified and considered. Finally, two interventions on which some progress has been made, are described: these include insulation and thermal performance projects in new low-cost houses, and a compact fluorescent lighting programme.

TI  - Biomass energy systems for single family houses - Efficiency, emissions and costs
T2  - BIOMASS FOR ENERGY AND INDUSTRY
CP  - 10th European Conference and Technology Exhibition on Biomass for Energy and Industry
AB  - Biomass can be used for the production of electricity, heat and/or liquid fuels. The energy efficiency, emissions and costs, however, will vary among the different energy carriers produced and the technologies used. In this study, heat production with local, electric heat pumps and biomass-fired pellet boilers in single family houses was analysed. The primary energy sources used are logging residues and crude oil. Diesel is used for the recovery and transportation of logging residues. The electricity required for the heat pump is produced in biomass-fired condensing plants. Cost and fuel consumption as well as CO2, SOx, NOx and HC emissions were calculated for each step in the whole fuel chain. The primary energy use and the emissions of CO2, HC, NOx and SOx are about two limes higher for the pellet boiler system than for the heat pump system. The impact on the emission of CO2, HC and NOx of longer transportation is significant in all systems. The heat production with the heat pump system, however, is more expensive than with the pellet boiler system.

TI  - Environmental impact of residential heating and cooling system energy efficiency upgrades
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN POWER CONFERENCE, VOL. 60, PTS I & II
CP  - 60th Annual Meeting of the American-Power-Conference
AB  - Over the nest twenty years, increased generation from primarily fossil fuel-fired plants will satisfy a growing demand for electrical energy. Atmospheric emissions of CO2 and other combustion products from such generation pose an increasing risk to the Earth's ecosystems. Most emissions attributable to the residential sector result from the use of space heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, there is much potential to lower peak energy demand, reduce atmospheric emissions, and cut energy costs to households by increasing the efficiency of space heating and air conditioning units. This article examines the potential impact of upgrading aging residential heating and cooling equipment in the United States to energy efficient, environment-friendly technologies. Resulting potential savings in energy and reductions in adverse environmental impacts are discussed.

TI  - Household energy consumption patterns: The energy ladder approach
T2  - ENERGY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: IS SUSTAINABLE GROWTH POSSIBLE?, VOLS 1-3
CP  - 20th Annual International Conference of the International-Association-for-Energy-Economics
AB  - There are contrasting differences between the household energy consumption in the rural versus urban households. In the rural areas mostly traditional fuels like fuelwood are used which are at available to the households at zero monetary cost. The availability of these traditional fuels like fuelwood is becoming severely restricted due to fast depletion of the local forests and the non-availability of an alternative source of fuel. Based on the consumption expenditure patterns it can be observed that the expenditure on fuel which is at a subsistence level in the beginning will slowly shift towards commercial forms of energy for the sake of convenience and energy efficiency.
   The responsiveness of fuel expenditure for changes in income, and the type of fuel used has not been done for All India. This study addresses the shifts in the fuel source with an increase in income, in the framework of energy ladder. Fuel - wise demand for energy was also studied. The energy ladder is a concept used to describe the way in which households will move to more sophisticated fuels as their income increases. For this national sample survey data given by the NSSO for all India rural and urban areas was used. The rounds covered were 27, 28, 32, and 38. Four main fuels were chosen for study, namely, coke, fuelwood, kerosene, and electricity.
   It was found that in the rural areas, there was an increase in the use of kerosene and electricity over the rounds. In the urban areas, all the fuels first registered an increase, then decreased in the 38th round, showing the possibility that other fuel sources may have assumed importance in the household sector, like LPG. In the case of expenditure on energy according to income (expenditure) classes, the rural areas registered a decrease in the expenditure with the increase in income. On the other hand, the urban areas showed an increase in the total expenditure on energy with an increase in income.

TI  - The attitudinal differences in source separation and waste reduction between the general public and the housewives in Hong Kong
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - As in most Western communities, source separation of household waste has gained popularity among the general public in Hong Kong. Despite an increasing number of married women involved in full time paid work, women are most involved in waste management in most Hong Kong families. Thus, the attitude of this social group-housewives-is decisive in the success of the source separation of household waste and other recycling related activities.
   Attitudinal differences between housewives and the general public were found with respect to the amount of avoidable waste, the incentive level of waste collection charges, the acceptable level of a green premium, the support of source separation of household waste and a deposit-refund system on beverage containers and cell batteries. Although housewives were also found to support waste recycling and reduction, the intensity of support was more modest in general than in the rest of the Hong Kong population, with the exception of the deposit-refund scheme for beverage containers. At the same time, economic incentive is a more powerful drive for housewives than for the general public at large for enhancing waste recycling and reduction. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

TI  - Energy efficiency of formal low-cost housing in South Africa's Gauteng region
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
AB  - A large percentage of South Africa's population is at present housed in low-cost dwellings. Furthermore, more than 2 million new houses must be built over the next 10 years to alleviate the current housing shortage. Unfortunately the existing houses are very energy inefficient and if nothing is done now, the new houses will surely also be inefficient. It would have a tremendous impact on the inhabitant's disposable income, health as well as their environment if these low-cost houses could be made energy efficient. This prompted the authors to investigate retrofit options to improve the energy efficiency of existing houses and to evaluate energy efficiency design concepts for new houses. The energy efficiency of the improvements was evaluated by means of computer simulations. Ceiling insulation was found to be the best retrofit for the typical formal low-cost house. By retrofitting existing formal low-cost houses with insulation integrated ceilings the Gauteng region could save $12 million in electricity costs per year and $0.79 billion in peak demand electricity supply. If the proposed new houses are supplied with insulation integrated ceilings the Gauteng region could save approximately $2 million in electricity costs per year and $224 million in peak demand electricity supply.

TI  - Civano-Tucson Solar Village: A model sustainable community
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST NATIONAL PASSIVE SOLAR CONFERENCE
CP  - 21st National Passive Solar Conference - Sundancin in the Smokies (Solar 96)
AB  - Civano, or Tucson Solar Village, is a model for sustainable communities. The community planning process actively incorporated the efforts & commitment of the citizens of Tucson, motivated by a desire to live in such a community. establishing performance standards, there was a struggle to balance high standards with the realities of the housing market. Current practices were examined to develop a baseline to be used as a point of reference for tracking the project.
   Energy standards were developed with the assistance of computer modeling to predict energy savings of individual solar and energy efficiency strategies. Costs associated with the strategies were calculated to determine economic feasibility. The end result is the Civano Energy Code, now being used on a voluntary basis. It's widespread use is the next logical step in improving energy efficiency in Tucson homes.
   The City of Tucson is implementing a marketing and education program and will participate initially in monitoring the results.

TI  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF ULTRA-LOW-COST HOUSING
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Housing is a problem in all developing countries. Presently South Africa has a large urbanization drive, to such an extent that over the next 10 years 1300 houses per day must be built to alleviate the problem. Most of the the houses currently being erected could be described as ultra-low-cost houses. These houses ale constructed by their owners in record time from corrugated iron. Advantages are the accessibility of building material and straightforward building techniques.
   Unfortunately the dwellings are thermally and energy inefficient. As a result inhabitants spend a disproportionate percentage of their income on winter heating. They use highly polluting and low energy content fuels such as wood and coal. This presents health risks and burdens the environment and natural resources.
   This paper evaluates the potential of inexpensive modifications which contribute to improved living and environmental conditions. Investigations ale based on a unique analysis method which is eminently suitable for application to the problem. Modifications such as cardboard insulation showed the most potential. Although often available fr ee of charge as waste products, results indicate that a definite cost saving incentive exists even if owners have to buy the cardboard.
   Modifying the houses as suggested reduces energy requirements and the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by up to 75%. The subsequent reduced burning of wood and coal also improves indoor living conditions. Implementing the results of this study thus will not only benefit the inhabitants of ultra-low-cost housing bur will also help to preserve the environment.

TI  - ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF FORMAL LOW-COST HOUSING
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
CP  - World Renewable Energy Congress III - Climate Change, Energy and the Environment
AB  - South Africa aims to build 3 million houses in the next six years. The most energy efficient design has to be identified to ensure the optimal use of South Africa's resources and to create a prosperous environment for her inhabitants. For this purpose the various formal low-cost house concepts on the market were evaluated and the projected impact on the country calculated. Houses were evaluated by means of a computer programme, Quick. Through simulations it was found that the common brick building built according to passive design guidelines is the best performer. The difference between the best and worst performer accounts to predicted direct cumulative savings in energy costs for a country like South Africa of over R180 million (US$72 million) per anum.

TI  - AN ECONOMETRIC-ANALYSIS OF RESIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES ON ENERGY-CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE ENERGY-SOURCES
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - Economic theory suggests that residential expenditures on energy conservation and renewable energy sources will be determined by the ability of households to purchase conservation inputs, their incentive to invest in conserving energy, the energy efficiency of existing homes and miscellaneous factors such as climate and age of the home-owner. Empirical analyses of energy-related expenditures reported on individual income tax returns confirm the importance of household income, energy price increases and climate conditions in determining energy conservation investments. Income tax credits are also found to have stimulated residential spending on conservation and renewable energy.

TI  - ENERGY PERFORMANCE BASED CONNECTION FEES - A CASE-STUDY IN NEW-YORK-STATE
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
AB  - Energy connection fees and rebates, based on the projected energy load or efficiency of new buildings are currently being considered as a policy option for promoting greater energy efficiency in new construction. In theory, a well designed system of connection fees and rebates could provide states and utilities with a revenue neutral means of creating direct financial incentives for the construction of more energy-efficient buildings. However, a recent case study in New York State found that, in practice, many of the most important features affecting building energy efficiency could not be easily incorporated in connection fee programmes, and that implementation of even a scaled down programme would require a level of administrative commitment and resources which would be difficult to maintain. Instead of implementing connection fee programmes, the authors recommend devoting more resources to an approach based on the combined use of building energy rating systems, enhanced codes with better enforcement, and strategically placed financial incentives and design assistance.

TI  - CLIMATE AND HOUSING FORM - A CASE-STUDY OF NEW-DELHI
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
CP  - 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONF ON URBAN CLIMATE, PLANNING AND BUILDING
AB  - New Delhi's climate is a difficult climate to design for, being composite in nature:  it experiences a dry - hot summer with temperatures up to 45-degrees-C and winters with temperatures down to 3-degrees-C and an in-between hot - humid season.  The city of Delhi has a long continuous history and each stage of its development, from medieval times through the colonial period until the New Delhi of today, is to be found intact as a standing record.  Each period of the city's historical development has been marked by a distinct pattern of urban growth.  It is interesting to note that while climate has been an important and constant factor, the overlaying of cultural, socio-economic and technological changes resulted in widely different forms of urban structure being adopted.
   The changes in housing form that occurred through the three stages of the city's development were analysed systematically keeping climate as a constant factor with the variables of construction, urban structure, social patterns and symbolic language being seen as dynamic counterpoints to understand the resultant built form.  This was used to identify principles of housing design of the traditional and colonial forms of housing which could be adopted to serve present-day needs and to identify those irreversible developments which make our present situation significantly different from the past.
   The lessons learnt from the analysis commended:  (a) from the traditional housing form - the value of a tightly knit urban structure that shelters both outdoor and indoor spaces, and the street and court as socially meaningful spatial configurations; (b) from the colonial example - the use of vegetation as a microclimate modifier combined with a relaxation of built density to respond more favourably to humid and cold seasons.  The factors that distinguish the present situation from the traditional and colonial situations are motorized vehicular access, relatively low mass of building construction materials and techniques, and the pressure on land causing high population densities and high-rise construction.
   The lessons of this research are applied to two housing design projects for the middle-income group category of housing.  These architectural solutions, which aim at optimizing environmental qualities for housing along with climatic comfort and energy utilization, suggest some limits of density and land-utilization beyond which environmental quality and energy efficiency would decline.  It is recommended that such design exercises be undertaken to establish both the lower and upper limits of density and land-utilization for housing so as to provide a more holistic basis for fixing town planning norms.
