AB  - On 2 September 1945, representatives of the Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on the deck of the USS Missouri, anchored in Tokyo Bay. So ended perhaps the most reckless of all modern wars, the outcome of which was decided by U.S. technical superiority even before it started. Japan lost in material terms even before it attacked Pearl Harbor: In 1940 the United States produced roughly 10 times as much steel as Japan did, and during the war the difference grew further. ? The devastated Japanese economy did not surpass its prewar peak until 1953. But by then the foundations had been laid for the country?s spectacular rise. Soon its fast-selling exports ranged from the first transistor radios (Sony) to the first giant crude-oil tankers ( Sumitomo). The first Honda Civic arrived in the United States in 1973, and by 1980, Japanese cars claimed 30 percent of the U.S. market. Japan, totally dependent on crude-oil imports, was hit hard by the OPEC oil price rises of the 1970s, but it adjusted rapidly by pursuing energy efficiency, and in 1978 it became the world?s second largest economy. By 1985 the yen was so strong that the United States, feeling threatened by Japanese imports, forced its devaluation through the Plaza Accord. But even afterward the economy soared: In the five years following January 1985 the Nikkei index rose more than threefold. ? It was too good to be true; indeed, the success reflected the working of an enormous bubble economy driven by inflated stock and real estate prices. In January 2000, ten years after its peak, the Nikkei was still at only half its 1990 value, and only recently has it risen above even that low mark. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - There is a growing interest in a sustainable built environment and green technologies are gaining worldwide attention. However, implementing green technologies usually requires more investment than using traditional technologies and the payback period tends to be very long. In China, most developers sell their properties and subsequently transfer the ownership to customers. Hence, a crucial problem for promoting green construction is that developers cannot obtain economic profits (“gold”) from implementing “green” technologies. Meanwhile, other stakeholders, such as property management companies, are also hesitant to adopt green technologies because of the large investment involved and their lack of experience. To tackle this problem, an energy performance contracting (EPC) based framework is proposed, to turn “green” investment into “gold” benefit by careful sharing of the risks existed. The framework was developed by conducting a focus group meeting with three experienced representatives from developer, property management company and energy service company respectively. A real-life case study, which includes both energy efficient system retrofit and new construction, is used to estimate the costs and benefits involved to demonstrate and verify the conceptual framework. The results show that the proposed framework can support the application of green technologies in both types of projects. Economic benefits as well as environmental benefits can be gained for the project stakeholders and the whole society. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

It shows that 82 percent of companies consider the significance of energy efficiency in the selection of green buildings to purchase or rent compared with 63 percent in 2009. However, only 19 percent of developers view the importance of green design due to scarcity of funding that led them to take on any project whether green or not.

AB  - Over the last 30 years, China's economy has boomed. This trend has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty but it has also sharply increased local, regional, and global pollution levels. We look at the rise in air pollution over recent decades, and the perhaps surprising finding that in many of China's urban areas, levels of particulates (of less than 10 microns) have been decreasing during the last 10 to 15 years. We then turn to the costs and tradeoffs of air pollution, including costs to human health, reductions in worker productivity, and how people are seeking to reduce their exposure to pollution as shown by compensating differentials in real estate prices and purchases of masks and air filters. We discuss how rising incomes tend to raise the demand for environmental amenities and thus increase political pressure for environmental protection, and then we turn to the policy tools that China has used to reduce pollution. We conclude by arguing that as China's government is preparing for an additional 300 million people to move to urban areas over the next 30 years, it will have a number of opportunities for China to reduce pollution through a shift from manufacturing to services, along with various steps to improve energy efficiency and resource conservation. Overall, it seems that China is on track to improve its environmental performance in the years ahead. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Energy performance remains a debated topic in real estate, particularly with reference to the capitalisation effect with property value. An emerging corpus of research studies have investigated the relationship between energy performance characteristics and the role of Energy Performance Certificates. Whilst these studies have consistently demonstrated that a pricing effect exists, some recent studies have shown that Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are more complex and inconclusive, particularly when accounting for data limitations and changing model specifications. Moreover, a majority of these studies neglect to adequately account for absolute location and therefore, arguably, do not examine the geographic variation between EPCs and property value across the housing market setting. This study presents one of the first spatial analyses of EPCs using transactions for the Belfast Metropolitan Area. In evaluating whether spatial effects exist between EPCs and house prices, a number of spatial tests are performed and a series of models are developed to account for spatial dependency and determine whether there are any spatially correlating effects. The findings indicate that EPCs comprise a partial effect on house prices, and importantly, there are pricing differentials in the spatial variation in EPCs with the pricing effects conforming to both spatial clustering and randomness.

AB  - Purpose: Property management in commercial real estate (CRE) is an important operational function that needs to be managed because it brings large cost implications to the organization. As India aspires to become a developed real estate market, analysis of the growing importance of automating property services and technology acceptance by stakeholders are two key concerns that need to be explicitly addressed. This study aims to examine the extent of property technology (PropTech) adoption in India and propose a technology-enabled stakeholder management model in Indian CRE. Design/methodology/approach: The research is qualitative in nature and follows the grounded theory approach. Research data were collected by conducting a series of semi-structured interviews with 18 property management professionals from different prominent Indian companies using PropTech. Findings: The findings suggested the nine most typical automated property management functions in Indian CRE. The result of this research is the automated property services model for stakeholder management in CRE. The model demonstrates the value of implementing technology in property services in India. Practical implications: The study provides useful insights into how artificial intelligence (AI) in property management can be applied to address property-related challenges, various stakeholder needs and improve property performance in accordance with energy efficiency policies. Originality/value: This paper attempts to add to the limited body of literature on technology in the property management domain. The model demonstrates how automated property services meet the needs of different stakeholders in CRE and provides remote working procedures within the COVID-19 pandemic context.

AB  - Energy Star, the largest voluntary housing eco-labelling programme in the US, conveys important signals to housing market actors about the energy efficiency of homes. With energy demand from housing being a significant energy consumer and contributor to climate change, gaining insight into the diffusion patterns of these certifications is an important analytical step. Informed by theories of new product adoption, research is used to identify the factors associated with the diffusion patterns of Energy Star certifications into US single-family housing from 2002 to 2013. The findings are generally congruent with recent studies of energy-efficiency adoption patterns in commercial property (real estate) and residential building construction. The key significant predictors of variation in the proportion of Energy Star-certified homes across US core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) are found to be public policy, climate, market attributes, industry characteristics and energy prices.

AB  - The research of household electricity use is still relatively new for Singapore, where apart from some government surveys and sparingly available papers, not much has been done to understand the underlying socio-economic determinants that affect residents’ energy demand. Here, we seek to quantify price and income elasticities, as well as provide reasonable justification for price asymmetry in Singapore using a panel approach across dwelling types and geographical areas. We find that households do not react much to prices, and that price elasticities may decrease as income rises. There is also some evidence of price asymmetry, with surprising results putting responsiveness towards price decreases larger than price increases. This points towards similar behavioural patterns with the rebound effect for household energy efficiency, if found present in future studies. Our findings suggest that there will only be positive responses towards dynamic pricing and higher churn rates if more transparent information is provided on related cost savings, when households are exposed to retail choice in the electricity market after full retail competition is introduced in 2018. In addition, a large role will have to come from cultivating the young to engage in sustainable practices to achieve energy efficiency targets. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The main use of energy in the residential sector in Canada is for space heating. Reductions in residential energy use, therefore, are likely to be achieved primarily through energy-saving retrofits, such as improved insulation. Reasons advanced to explain the foot-dragging of the residential sector in this regard are examined here, along with various policy options. Canadian survey data from 2003 are used to examine and compare the most energy-inefficient households who saw no need for retrofits with other households who provided a similar response, with a view to assessing whether there are factors that can be exploited to increase the uptake of such retrofits. The results suggest there is likely to be no quick fix. In the absence of large retrofit subsidies, with their accompanying free-rider problem, or a multi-pronged strategy that includes a whole array of policy instruments, including one that changes the relative importance of energy costs in household budgets, the outlook for sizeable improvements in residential energy efficiency in Canada via residential retrofits does not appear to be overly promising. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Dans le secteur résidentiel, au Canada, l’énergie utilisée est principalement liée au chauffage. On peut donc en conclure que la meilleure façon de réduire la quantité d’énergie utilisée dans ce secteur est d’apporter aux immeubles des changements qui permettraient d’économiser de l’énergie (une meilleure isolation, par exemple). Dans cet article, nous tentons donc d’expliquer pourquoi les progrès, sur ce plan, piétinent, et nous analysons diverses politiques liées à cette question. Nous avons utilisé des données d’une enquête canadienne de 2003 pour comparer entre eux les ménages habitant des résidences parmi les moins efficaces sur le plan énergétique et n’ayant pourtant pas songé à leur apporter des modernisations, et nous analysons les facteurs qui pourraient contribuer à accroître la réalisation de telles modernisations. Nos résultats indiquent qu’il n’y a visiblement pas de solution applicable rapidement. En l’absence de vastes programmes de subventions pour la modernisation d’immeubles – à laquelle il faut ajouter le problème posé par le fait que des gens profitent indûment de telles subventions –, ou de stratégies à plusieurs volets incluant un large éventail d’instruments de politiques – dont des mesures permettant de modifier l’importance relative des coûts de l’énergie dans le budget des ménages –, il appert que l’on ne peut pas envisager de progrès significatifs pour bientôt dans l’amélioration de l’efficacité énergétique résidentielle au Canada grâce à la modernisation d’immeubles.

AB  - Five triads are presented that can be used as a framework to rank sustainable measures for the built environment in terms of space, transport, energy, water and materials. These new triads are all based on the same known principle of the Trias Energetica, which constitutes a three-step strategy to come to sustainable energy use. Most favourable measures which prevent energy use are defined as the top step and least favourable measures which only benefit the energy efficiency form the last step. In between, the renewable energy sources have found their position. Analogous to this Trias Energetica, the terms ‘Trias Toponoma’ for space-use, ‘Trias Poreutica’ for transport, ‘Trias Hydrica’ for water consumption and ‘Trias Hylica’ for materials are introduced and explained. The framework of triads can be utilized by city planners, architects, facility managers, house owners, real estate agents and other parties in the building sector to communicate and make decisions on adopting sustainable measures, which will help to decrease the environmental impact of the building sector and to stimulate the development of sustainable buildings.

N2  - Government-led interorganizational alliance networks present a sensible opportunity to overcome many societal challenges through collaborative governance. In particular, few researchers have studied alliance networks in the field of energy conservation in commercial buildings--a sector with unique barriers to greater diffusion of innovative cost-saving strategies. We applied an analytic inductive case-based method and social network analysis to study one particular alliance network: the United States Commercial Building Energy Alliances representing interests from retail, commercial real estate, and healthcare sectors. This alliance network was initiated by the United States Department of Energy, with assistance from several federally funded research laboratories in the United States, to promote the diffusion of knowledge and ultimately encourage greater deployment of energy efficiency and clean energy strategies in commercial buildings. We draw upon interview data from 28 cases of private, non-profit, and governmental organizations and complete network data from the alliance participants. We honed in on eight focal cases of governmental organizations to provide insight on how the four forms of energy and environmental data, information, and knowledge shared within an alliance network address the challenge of a vastly underutilized energy resource, namely conservation. Further, we identify and discuss the public's four roles--commissioner, interpreter, marketer, and user--in providing balance to the diffusion of both private and public goods in a network.

AB  - In a new environment marked by the growing importance of Green House Gas emissions, fuel poverty, and energy efficiency in the different national agendas, the comprehension of energy demand factors appears to be crucial for the effectiveness of energy policies. We consider the latter could be improved by targeting specific household groups rather than looking to follow a single energy consumption level target. This article explores the scope of having a disaggregated energy consumption market to design policies aimed at curbing residential energy consumption or lowering its carbon intensity. Using a clustering method based on the CHAID (Chi Square Automatic Interaction Detection) methodology, we find that the different levels of energy consumption in the French residential sector are related to socio-economic, dwelling and regional characteristics. Then, we build a typology of energy-consuming households where targeted groups (fuel poor, high income and high consuming households) are clearly and separately identified through a simple and transparent set of characteristics. This classification represents an efficient tool for energy efficiency programs and energy poverty policies, but also for potential investors, which could provide specific and tailor made financial tools for the different consumer groups. Furthermore, our approach helps designing some energy efficiency score that could reduce the rebound effect uncertainty for each identified household group. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Private homeowners can save considerable amounts of energy and money, if they retrofit their homes according to up-to-date energy efficiency standards. From an expert point of view, many of these technical measures are profitable in relatively short payback times, if only additional costs are considered. Apparently, many homeowners do not follow this type of rationality and do solely not regard their refurbishment as an investment. Drawing on the results of an empirical survey of retrofit activities among 1,008 homeowners in Germany, it is argued that refurbishments are the outcome of a broader decision which is shaped by an alliance of economic and non-economic motives and goals. Energy-saving measures is expected to lower the burden of operating costs in a perceptible way and secure the value of the house, but they must also correspond to needs like comfort, convenience or belonging in order to be realized.

N2  - Consumers' limitations in assessing the lifetime cost of household appliances may sustain the much-cited energy efficiency gap. We analyse the impact of an individual's energy and investment literacy and two different types of decision support on the ability to identify the appliance with the lower lifetime cost in an online randomized controlled trial among two independently chosen samples of the Swiss population. In a decision task, participants choose between appliances with different lifetime cost. One treatment offers a short education programme on how to calculate the lifetime cost of an appliance--via a set of information slides. The second treatment provides access to an online lifetime-cost calculator tool. We find that pre-treatment energy and investment literacy are positively associated with the probability of identifying the appliance with the lowest lifetime cost. Evidence in this paper suggest that both decision aids boost identification of energy-efficient appliances. We discuss strategies to scale up these boosters.

AB  - Providing consumers with information that can lead to more energy-efficient choices can help reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions while reducing costs to consumers. A natural field experiment is conducted in collaboration with an electrical retailer to test strategies for influencing sales of household appliances. The experiment involves two product categories, fridge-freezers and tumble driers. Information on lifetime energy cost of appliances is provided through a label and training of sales staff. For fridge-freezers, the authors find no significant effects. For tumble driers, the combined treatment and training treatment reduce average energy use of tumble driers sold by 4.9% and 3.4%, respectively. The effect is strongest initially, over 12% on average for the first 3 months for the combined treatment but declines over time. The effect is significant at the 5% level for the combined treatment while not significant for sales staff training. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - This article presents an economic framework for evaluating the net benefits or costs of building code regulations through their effect on housing markets, accounting for distributional impacts. The role of building codes can primarily be classified into three scenarios: (1) An industry standard that reduces transaction costs; (2) An isolated quality standard; or (3) A quality standard with spillover effects. To holistically evaluate the impact of a particular building regulation, we propose three major guidelines: (1) Correct market failures; (2) Estimate market impacts; and (3) Account for distributional considerations. This framework is applied to energy efficiency regulations and solar panels in particular. Energy efficiency codes reduce negative environmental externalities and information asymmetry and promote high-quality long-term affordable housing stock; however, the willingness to pay for energy efficiency varies with income. Policymakers must consider how policies intended to promote the welfare of low-income housing residents might create exclusionary impacts due to increasing the cost of supplying housing.

N2  - Residential energy efficiency is a core element of the decarbonisation policy in many nations. In the UK, the established approach to enabling efficiency gains through centralised retrofitting programmes involves socialising costs via consumer energy bills through the Energy Company Obligation (ECO). One UK policy concern is whether less affluent households should receive greater access to ECO funding. However, there is a broader concern that the use of constrained public resources should be justified through wider and sustained economic returns emerging. Here, we consider the (centralised) ECO approach to cost recovery alongside alternative (decentralised) approaches to delivering energy efficiency programmes that either pass costs to beneficiary households or fully socialise costs via income tax. We find the key drivers of both household and wider economy outcomes are the absolute levels of resources actually devoted to enabling efficiency gains and household disposable income freed up to power expansionary processes. The latter in particular brings challenges and trade-offs in terms of meeting both economic performance and social policy objectives, given that resources targeted at higher income households can ultimately free up more real spending ability and sustain greater gains in GDP, employment and household incomes.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether energy efficiency is capitalized in rent and asset value on corporate real estate portfolio. This approach contributes to the research on "green buildings" by using hedonic regression modeling on a portfolio of existing buildings in the French corporate real estate context. Design/methodology/approach - The authors apply hedonic methods on a French corporate real estate portfolio which is composed of industrial, commercial and office buildings. Findings - This model emphasizes two main results: energy efficiency is more capitalized in rent than in asset value and this relationship differs regarding buildings' type. Originality/value - The model suggests that premium for energy efficiency is stronger for commercial and office buildings than for industrial buildings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - Real estate is one of the largest contributors to CO2 emissions yet the industry knows very little about this topic. This paper provides a background on carbon markets and their potential role in a proposed strategy for energy efficiency improvements (EEI). It compares the relationship between an investment decision based solely on electricity prices to one that incorporates the monetary benefit associated with carbon offsets. The findings suggest that a regulated carbon 'cap and trade' system could provide additional value to property owners who pursue EEI strategies. Moreover, carbon offset value differs significantly by geographic location and method by which electrical energy is produced. EEI strategies that take into account carbon offset value could significantly reduce the impact that commercial real estate has on the environment.

AB  - Carbon tax is among the most intensively discussed topics in energy research and policy nowadays, but the question of using carbon tax revenue for environmental and energy policy purposes has received little attention so far. Currently the revenue generated from carbon tax has different usage in the countries worldwide, with only one quarter used for environmental and sustainable energy purposes. Against this background we study whether it can be advisable to use carbon tax revenue for financing energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) programs. Based on the case study of Switzerland, we demonstrate that such a policy approach could not only allow to achieve additional reduction of CO 2 emissions, but also considerable net benefits to household sector with regard to reduction of heating costs, while having rather low program costs for individual households. • Carbon tax and energy programs should be seen as complementary policy mechanisms. • Greater CO 2 savings and net benefits to household sector could be achieved. • Policy costs to individual households are relatively low. • Extended literature review on carbon tax provided. • Policy evaluation with concrete examples of retrofit measures provided.

Under the American Clean Energy and Security Act, buildings must conform to environmentally sound practices with regard to energy efficiency, which does not apply to commercial properties. Due to the economic crisis, various taxes are expected to be levied on high income earners which will impact their purchasing power. A lobby is being formed to ease real estate taxes.

N2  - In the 2010s, major US initiatives framed urban retrofitting as a decarbonization solution. These programs address an obtrusive legacy of industrial capitalism: its built environments shed energy and emissions when they fall into disrepair. Political ecology and economy have been slow to engage retrofitting, an absence that is conspicuous as these fields take on planetary repair as a conceptual provocation and turn in mainstream conservation. This paper explores US retrofitting as a distinctive material repair practice, one born as an energy poverty program amid the scarcity fears of the 1970s Energy Crisis but seeing a renaissance today as a program for green capitalist growth. I interrogate two economies of repair now emerging around retrofitting, energy market and cleantech aspirations to make energy efficiency a resource and articulated efforts to sell retrofits as new green value for real estate development and investment. Such urban revaluation efforts join an expanding array of green gentrification schemes today. Paradoxically, even as would-be green entrepreneurs are drawn to these seemingly intangible and "clean" forms of waste and value-in-waiting, retrofitting presents intransigent materialities. Its decarbonization ambitions demand not just profit-generating urban repair today but large-scale urban maintenance into the future. This need confronts longstanding efforts to render US cities and built environments flexible to recurrent creative destruction in service of ongoing economic growth. Such logics of de/revaluation and essential disposability permit concurrent US programs for gentrification and urban abandonment today. However, decarbonization requires a more substantial confrontation with capitalist ruination-as-usual.

N2  - Uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic of climate change. This paper focuses on uncertainty that is introduced in the implementation of policy, especially as it affects the level and distribution of the burden on households that results from the allocation of emissions allowances. We examine the Waxman-Markey bill (H.R. 2454), with bookend scenarios labeled optimistic and pessimistic. The scenarios vary outcomes associated with allocations to local distribution companies, investments in electricity energy efficiency and technology development. We introduce a third scenario that allocates a substantial portion of allowance value directly to households. We find the average consumer surplus loss per household in 2016 in the optimistic scenario to be $136 and the allowance price is as low as $13.20 per ton. In the pessimistic scenario, the consumer surplus loss rises to $413, with an allowance price of $23.43 per ton. Allocation of allowance value directly back to households provides an intermediate, but more certain, result.

AB  - Energy used in housing is a major contributor to Australia's energy consumption. The country's vastness leads itself into a broad range of climate conditions and each climate zone demands different energy efficient characteristics in housing. Real estate agents play an active role in motivating buyers in purchasing energy efficient housing through advertising. The objective of this research is to examine whether the promotion of house energy efficient features in advertisements is influenced by the climate zones. The research examined detached dwelling advertisements in three climate zones in Victoria, Australia – hot, mild and cool – during the period of 2008 – 2013 with over 40,000 advertisements reviewed. This was complemented by in-depth interviews with nine senior real estate agents practising within these climate zones. Results highlight that energy efficiency features were not considered to be a major factor when advertising residential properties. However, there were differences in advertising characteristics related to energy efficient features across climate zones. Advertisements in colder zones tended to have more energy saving related words. Yet, distinctive design characteristics for different climate zones are not significantly differentiated and agents tend to follow standard wording when describing them. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract As significant contributors to global carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, the international construction sector is under great pressure to mitigate CO 2 emissions and slow global warming more aggressively. The aim of this study is to measure and compare the sectoral CO 2 emission linkages and their structures in the construction sectors of 41 countries over 1995–2009 by combing a hybrid multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model and the hypothesis extraction method. The backward and forward CO 2 emission linkages indicate that the international construction sector plays a significant role in importing CO 2 emissions from upstream industries, while the export of CO 2 emissions to downstream industries is relatively minimal. Four fundamental linkage elements show that the net backward CO 2 emission linkages account for the largest proportion, followed by the mixed and net forward CO 2 emission linkages, while the mixed backward CO 2 emission linkages are relatively small. The leading CO 2 emission inflows are from the energy, resource and raw-material sectors. The outflows from the construction sector are mainly to the real estate and public utilities sectors. Based on these findings, the paper puts forward countermeasures for the global construction sector to improve energy efficiency, promote industrial structure upgrading and improve the policy system for greenhouse gas emission reduction.

AB  - The article reports on the energy proposal to impose strict energy standards of commercial buildings prohibiting emissions of greenhouse gases by the U.S. House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee in June 2007. The Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM) has remarked the unrealistic concept of developing and retrofitting buildings to zero-net energy standards. Thus, Senators were debating the Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 requiring energy-efficiency improvements and electricity consumption standards in federal and commercial buildings. However, a bi-partisan bill creating the Low Carbon Economy Act was introduced which would provide monetary incentives for greenhouse gas producers who could reduce carbon emissions to 60 percent if approved.

N2  - Conveyance, i.e. the fact that an appliance purchased will be left in a dwelling when moving out, may lead homeowners to purchase appliances of lower quality or performance, because the extra costs are not entirely capitalized into the house sales price. Employing a discrete choice experiment with homeowners in the United States, this paper explores the effects of conveyance on homeowners' willingness-to-pay for various attributes of refrigerators. To account for the social nature of purchases when conveyance is likely to occur, it also tests the role of envy (elicited through an incentivized game). The findings provide evidence that conveyors are more likely than non-conveyors to purchase a smaller refrigerator, from a less well-known brand, and with lower customer ratings. In contrast, conveyance was not found to affect homeowners' choices when it comes to energy cost. In addition, envy was found to generally reinforce the negative effects of conveyance on homeowners' willingness-to-pay for several quality and performance attributes. While conveyance and its interaction with envy help explain why some homeowners choose certain quality/performance attributes of appliances, these factors do not appear to explain the energy efficiency paradox.

AB  - Improving the energy efficiency of retail stores has become an important strategy for retailers. However, why do some retailers obtain Energy Star certification for their stores while others do not? We argue that retailers pursue this certification to capture reputational benefits of the Energy Star label when their stock market valuation is low. Using longitudinal data for US retailers (grocery and department stores) over the period of 2002 to 2014, we find that stock market valuation measured by Tobin’s Q explains (1) the likelihood of a retailer obtaining Energy Star certification and (2) the share of Energy Star-certified stores in a retailer’s portfolio. Operating expenses on the other hand do not appear to drive the decision to obtain Energy Star certification. Our results also suggest that the motivations of retailers to obtain LEED and Energy Star certification differ. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - A number of international jurisdictions have articulated a longer term goal of zero emission housing standards. However, in Australia, housing energy efficiency remains a contested policy area. In part, this is due to a lack of clear cost-benefit information on low emission housing standards, including impacts at the household level. This research investigated the lifetime economics of low emission housing options for typical housing in Melbourne, Australia. The analysis found that for a zero emission house, there was an additional capital cost of $25,637. This translated into extra yearly mortgage repayments of $2,117 at an interest rate of 7.89% across 25 years. However, energy efficiency cost savings of $1,547 a year were calculated, leaving a gap of $570/year in additional mortgage repayments. As a result, policy makers in Australia should focus on reducing upfront costs and developing innovative financial frameworks in order to make low emission housing achievable.

AB  - Purpose: The article presents the actual problem of determining cost of construction project implementation. Within the conducted research, an analysis of existing approaches to managing project costs in the face of uncertainty was carried out, including the justification of the possibility of using the contract system for the purpose of optimizing the project, as well as identification of possibilities of cost engineering. Design/methodology/approach: A Case-study method, based on an assessment of the performance indicators of an investment project for the construction of a city boiler house and the project cost analysis using the Earned Value Technique, was used to prove the hypothesis about the effectiveness of using cost engineering. Findings: The results of evaluating the effectiveness of project implementation was substantiated, and the feasibility of applying the EPC contract for the cost optimization was proven. The projects implemented with the EPC contracts have a high potential. EPC/M contracts are widely used in other countries, but in Russia, this type of contract is just beginning to be used. Originality/value: In the result of the analysis, it was revealed that the main factors affecting the cost of the boiler house implementation construction project were the imperfection of the pricing system, the presence of unrecorded work and costs, the inadequacy of the rationing system; the violation of technology and timing of implementation.

AB  - This cost-benefit analysis study considered energy-efficiency measures in low-cost housing, primarily standard 30 m[sup 2] Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) houses. The three packages of interventions that improve the thermal performance of the houses (ceilings, roof and wall insulation, windows and partitions) were found to be economically attractive both from a national and a household perspective. The net benefits from the whole package for a standard RDP home is about 10 per cent of the value of the housing subsidy provided by the government. The same interventions applied to informal housing appear more costly because the lifespan of shacks is taken to be five years. Row houses are particularly attractive, although their social acceptability requires further study. Compact fluorescent lamps and solar water heating are also attractive because of the energy savings they deliver. Apart from saving money, all these measures improve the quality of life of households by increasing comfort and decreasing indoor air pollution. Although the measures have a net social benefit, it does not mean that poor people can afford them. Energy-efficiency measures tend to have high capital costs, while the benefits are spread over many years. With their high discount rates, consumers are often not able to wait for future savings, nor do they have access to capital for investment. Based on our analysis, however, a capital subsidy of between R1 000 and R2 000 (not the full capital cost) is all that would be required to make these measures attractive to poor households across a range of regions and income groups. The no-cost measures of northern orientations: climatically correct window size and placement, as well as the appropriate wall and roof colour have a thermal running cost and environmental impact.

N2  - To address severe air pollution, the Chinese government plans to replace most residential coal stoves in northern China with clean heating devices by 2021. Coal stove replacement started in the "Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)" region and is expanding throughout northern China. Removing coal stoves reduces air pollutant emissions and hence is beneficial for both air quality and public health, as well as offering greenhouse gas mitigation co-benefits. However, there is little discussion of the economic costs of various clean heating technologies. In this study, we estimate total annual costs (TAC, annualized capital costs plus annual operating costs) for rural households, across cities/counties in the BTH region, to replace their coal stoves with several prevalent clean options--air-source heat pumps with fan coils (ASHPwF), electric resistance heaters with thermal storage (RHwTS), natural gas heaters (NGH), and clean coal briquettes with improved stoves (CCIS). We find: 1) Without subsidies, CCIS have the lowest TAC of all clean options. TAC of unsubsidized CCIS approximately doubles TAC of raw coal with improved stoves (RCIS), while unsubsidized electric/gas heaters cost 3-5 times more than RCIS. Thus, it is important for governments to financially support households' replacement of their coal stoves with clean heaters to facilitate widespread adoption. 2) With subsidies, CCIS have the lowest TAC in all regions except Beijing. In Beijing, generous subsides make ASHPwF--the most energy-efficient option--have the lowest TAC. In Tianjin, TAC of subsidized ASHPwF are slightly higher than CCIS and NGH. Throughout Hebei, except for a few severely cold northern counties where gas prices are high, subsidized NGH have lower TAC than ASHPwF and RHwTS. 3) Cost competitiveness of ASHPwF increases as heat demand increases, (e.g., higher desired indoor temperatures, larger home sizes, etc.) indicating that ASHP are good options for households with larger home sizes and commercial buildings. 4) Substantial potential exists to reduce heating expenses by improving building energy efficiency particularly in severely cold regions. 5) Cost advantages of NGH vary sharply with gas prices.

N2  - Purpose: About 27 per cent of the total UK carbon emissions are attributed to residential buildings; therefore, improvements to the energy efficiency of the stock offers great potential. There are three main ways to achieve this. First is a mandatory approach, minimum energy efficiency standards are set and applied to new and existing buildings. Option 2 is voluntary, using energy ratings that classify performance to stimulate awareness and action. Third, financial measures, incentives and taxes, are applied to "nudge" behaviours. Most westernised countries have adopted a combination of Options 2 and 3, with the belief that the market will incentivize efficient properties. The belief is voluntary measures will stimulate demand, leading to value premiums. This paper aims to seek a deeper understanding of the relationship between energy efficiency and the value of residential property in Europe and, by so doing, to determine whether stronger policies are required to realise decarbonisation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reviews the current academic literature and large-scale quantitative studies conducted in Europe, mostly using hedonic pricing analysis to seek a relationship between energy performance certificates (EPCs) and either capital or rental values. It compares these to the reported findings of three case study projects that take a variety of different research approaches, all of which have the ambition to understand market behaviours and stimulate occupier or/and owner demand for energy efficient buildings. Findings: The large-scale academic study results generally show a positive relationship between observed market prices and EPCs, which are commonly taken as surrogates for efficiency; however, outcomes are variable. One large study found energy upgrades may increase value, but not to the point where costs outweigh the value gain. Other studies found high returns on investment in energy efficiency technologies. The case study projects, however, revealed a more nuanced set of arguments in terms of the relationship between energy efficiency and market behaviours. Whilst there is some evidence that energy efficiency is beginning to impact on value, it is small compared to other value drivers; other drivers, including health, well-being and private sector finance deals, may prove more powerful market drivers. Further, the empirical findings reported point towards the emergence of a "brown" discount being more likely to be the long-term trend than a green premium. It is concluded that the current levels of action are unlikely to deliver the levels of decarbonisation urgently needed.

AB  - Abstract Low-carbon energy retrofitting in buildings plays an important role because 75% of European buildings are considered inefficient and more than 40% are currently over 50 years old. The economic reinvestment of energy retrofit actions through reduced energy bills, as energy directives promote, greatly depends upon the energy consumption patterns. In support of the decision-making process towards a low-carbon energy transition in multi-family buildings, this paper introduces a novel assessment method that evaluates the profitability of energy efficiency measures, according to standard operating conditions derived from energy performance certificate procedures and real occupant energy consumption scenarios, through a parametric analysis. The aim is to assess the real energy and economic savings of retrofitting actions, depending on different energy-related occupant scenarios, and to enable comparisons with other buildings, providing a valuable model to identify the most feasible and low-carbon energy strategies in residential energy retrofitting. A Spanish multi-family building from 1942 is taken as the reference case study. The results show that energy savings for dwellings vary up to 80%, and the net present value per dwelling differs by up to 20,000€ between different energy consumption patterns. The most appropriate energy efficiency measures according to low, medium or high consumption scenarios are highlighted. Highlights • Novel method to support the decision-making process in energy retrofitting. • A parametric analysis is made based on different energy consumption patterns. • Consumption profiles based on standard conditions and real behaviour of occupants. • Energy saving and return on investment are evaluated for each consumption scenario. • The method fulfils two main purposes of official procedures from energy directives.

AB  - Abstract: As the labor market in the U.S. remains weak, with high unemployment and sluggish job growth, policymakers at various levels of government are looking for new ways to support job growth and investment during an increasingly tight fiscal climate. Policies that promote the “Green Economy” in general and energy efficiency in particular remain politically popular as potential win–win solutions that will create jobs and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, efforts to promote energy efficiency in the residential sector through rebates and incentives alone have yet to reach critical mass. This paper outlines a policy option for state and local governments to use real estate transfer taxes to generate stronger incentives for home buyers to undertake significant retrofit projects at the time of sale. The economic impact of the proposed energy efficiency transfer tax (EETT) is then modeled for the State of North Carolina, using standard input–output techniques. Ultimately, based on housing sales figures from 2010, a new EETT of 2.5 percent on home purchases would generate a net positive increase of approximately 3485 direct construction jobs and 5900 annually total jobs for the state.

AB  - Abstract—Shortage of nonrenewable energy resources, the pollution arising from extraction and exploitation of these resources, and increasing demand for energy, along with the intermittent nature of renewable resources have resulted in more attention to demand response programs in smart grids. Demand response includes activities like load management, energy efficiency, and energy saving. The residential sector plays a significant role in achieving demand response goals. Home energy management systems shift or restrict a household demand; they consider power price and consumer's wellbeing and improve consumption and production profile of a house. In this work, a price-based, real-time demand response management model is proposed as a home energy management system. The model helps conservative householders save energy and improve energy efficiency through managing electrical appliances. The proposed model can be embedded in an energy control unit or a smart meter and find the optimal operation of the house for next 5 minutes via robust optimization technique, considering uncertainties of power price and distributed generation. The objective is to minimize the electricity costs of a home and improve the role of distributed generation and energy storage system installed inside the home while satisfying user's wellbeing and components constraints. The model is comprehensive, real-time, have high time resolution, and the results show that the model improves the costs of a conservative household. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: We first examine the determinants of household expenditures on space heating and hot water supply in Germany. A number of socio-economic characteristics of households are included along with building characteristics. Our analysis covers information on more than 12,000 households in Germany for the years 1998 and 2003. The analysis continues by investigating whether different kinds of households are affected differently by increases in energy prices. Households in owner-occupied properties are less affected compared to those in rented accommodation, this could be because owners are more likely to have installed energy-efficient heating and hot water supply systems and landlords have less of an incentive to improve the conditions of their rented accommodations. An energy policy targeting especially the latter group might benefit not only households in rented accommodation, but might also increase energy-efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well.

AB  - The article offers effective ways of producing low-cost energy savings for real estate industry. It implies that the landlords must aim for the set point that makes the majority of tenants comfortable and achieves energy management goals. It suggests the need of locking or removing thermostats in publicly accessible spaces to prevent unauthorized adjustments. This energy efficiency awareness can lead to tenant retention and progressive property management.

N2  - We build novel welfare-based price indices for major household appliances that leverage changes in same-model prices and how consumers substitute between exiting, continuing and new models. We then evaluate how minimum energy efficiency requirements and changing criteria for Energy Star^{TM} labels affected these indices in the U.S. between 2001 and 2011, a period of time when some appliances experienced standard changes while others did not. We find that prices declined while quality and consumer welfare increased, especially when standards become more stringent. We also find that much of the price index decline can be attributed to standards-induced innovation, or cannibalism, not to inter-manufacturer competition. Our results also add to a growing body of evidence that the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation due to inadequate account of quality and substitution to new goods.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of distinct types of heating technology and their price impact in German residential real estate markets, considering a wide range of other housing market determinants. The authors aim to test and to verify specifically, whether the obsolescence of heating technology leads to a significant price discount and whether higher technological standards (and environmental friendliness) come with a price premium on the market.Design/methodology/approach The authors create housing market models for rental and sales segments by constructing generalized additive models with explicit multi-layered spatial components. To elaborate a profound and contemporary answer using these models, the authors perform large-sample regression analyses based on more than 400,000 observations covering German residential properties in 2015.Findings First and foremost, the heating system indeed shows significant explanatory importance for measuring housing rents and purchasing price. Second, the authors find that it makes a difference whether clean “green” technologies are implemented or whether “brown” systems with obsolete technology or fossil energy sources is on hand. Ultimately, the authors conclude that while low energy consumption indeed comes with a price premium, this needs to be interpreted together with the property’s heating type, as housing markets seem to outweigh the “green premium” by “brown discounts” if low energy consumption figures are powered by a certain type of heating technology system.Research limitations/implications Aside of a possible omitted variable bias, the main research limitation is constituted by the integration of asking prices in the analysis, as actual transaction prices are not systematically transparent on national level in Germany. Limitations are discussed at the end of the paper.Practical implications This work supports investors who face the challenge of making environmental- and energy-related decisions as well as appraisers who deliver financial fundamentals for such. Third, the paper supports both asset managers as well as investment strategists in argumentation pro-environmental investments beyond all ecological necessity.Social implications This paper contributes to the current discussion on climate change and the eclectic role of real estate in this context. The authors deliver evidence on pricing effects as a measure of socioeconomic acceptance of progressive heating technology and environmental friendliness as an imperative of twenty-first century societies.Originality/value This is the first study on “green premiums” or “brown discounts” that includes heating technology as a potential and distinct driver of value and rents. It is a contemporary contribution and delivers original information on the quantitative impact of contemporary and anachronistic technology in heating to researchers as well as investors and appraisers.

N2  - This paper investigates whether energy performance ratings, as measured by mandatory Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are reflected in the sale prices of residential properties. This is the first large-scale empirical study of this topic in England involving 333,095 dwellings sold at least twice in the period from 1995 to 2012. Applying hedonic regression and an augmented repeat sales regression, we find a positive relationship between the energy efficiency rating of a dwelling and the transaction price per square metre. The price effects of superior energy performance tend to be higher for terraced dwellings and flats compared to detached and semi-detached dwellings. The evidence is less clear-cut for rates of house price growth but remains supportive of a positive association. Overall, the results of this study suggest that energy efficiency labels have a measurable and significant impact on house prices in England.

N2  - In order to further mitigate negative environmental impact, the European Union (EU) has adopted the so called "20-20-20" goals, in which a (primary) energy reduction target is included. Subsequently, the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for buildings (via the Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings) has been implemented in EU member states. In this paper, we examine the impact of EPCs on office revenues. By and large, we find that better EPC ratings have a positive and significant effect on revenues. This research area is important as improved energy efficiency in the built environment is necessary in order to reach the EU reduction target.

AB  - The “Energy Star” certification of residential homes is a recent attempt in the United States to improve energy efficiency in the residential sector by incentivizing home builders to “build green.” We examine the effectiveness of this program by estimating homeowners' marginal willingness to pay for Energy Star residences in Gainesville, Florida. We use single-family residential property sales in Gainesville, Florida between 1997 and 2009. Using the hedonic method, we find that homeowners are willing to pay a premium for new Energy Star homes, but that this premium fades rapidly in the resale market. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract This paper seeks to elucidate whether high levels of non-disclosure lead to adverse market outcomes in the form of the well-known lemons problem. It also empirically tests whether energy-efficiency ratings (EERs) are reflected in both housing sales prices and rents in the Australian Capital Territory, the only Australian housing market with mandatory ratings for all dwellings at point of sale or lease. Using a comprehensive dataset of sale and lease transactions during the period 2011–2016, a hedonic framework is applied. The analysis confirms that both the reported energy-efficiency levels and other sustainability-related characteristics that are not part of the formal rating assessment influence the pricing of both sales and rental transactions. Characteristics such as heating and cooling systems and the presence of solar power generators are significantly reflected in rents and sales prices, as tenants and buyers are likely to estimate their expected utility costs based on the EER. It is also shown that the option of leaving the EER of a rental property unreported presents a moral hazard for landlords of sub-standard properties, in that the likelihood of EER disclosure increases in line with the number of energy-efficient features of a property as revealed in the marketing material. The analysis also reveals that socio-economically disadvantaged areas suffer from disproportionately higher levels of EER non-disclosure, potentially constituting a ‘double disadvantage’ of non-disclosure and low–energy efficiency dwelling stock. From a market and asset-pricing perspective, it thus seems preferable to extend the requirement to obtain and present a valid EER to the rental market. Highlights • This paper explores the link between energy efficiency disclosure regimes and house prices. • The empirical analysis confirms that energy efficiency ratings are reflected in sales and rental prices. • More efficient heating and cooling systems and solar power generators are also significant price determinants. • Voluntary disclosure presents a moral hazard for landlords of sub-standard properties • Socio-economically disadvantaged areas suffer from disproportionately higher levels of non-disclosure.

N2  - In this paper the issue of market capitalization of energy efficient buildings is addressed by considering single-family housing in Sweden and through analyzing as to what extent the market price for a house is influenced by its energy performance. Are Swedish homeowners doing well by doing good? We make use of information provided by the Swedish energy performance certificates for single-family homes matched with data on the corresponding transaction prices, household characteristics and attributes of the neighborhood. The resulting database, covering about 77,000 individual observations, is used to analyze the relationship between the price of a house and its energy performance by means of a hedonic model. Unlike most other studies the energy performance is decomposed into energy consumption and several other variables characterizing the energy system. The main question addressed is if there is a price premium for energy efficient housing in Sweden. Our results differ from earlier studies and indicate no price premium related to the energy consumption but substantial premiums for housing attributes that improve the energy efficiency. A likely explanation is that prospective buyers of new homes base their expectations about future energy consumption on those attributes rather than on the energy consumption of the previous owner.

N2  - We investigate the factors ("drivers") that motivated investment in energy efficiency in commercial real estate office buildings over the 2006-2011 and 2012-2017 period, and looking forward from 2018 in the context of growing concern over carbon emissions around the world. These insights were collected from large Canadian asset managers through interviews conducted in 2017 and 2018. Key findings were that (1) organizations noted an increasing number of factors driving investment decisions over the three periods; (2) cost drivers (payback period and anticipated financial returns) were the top two drivers in 2006-2017; (3) public relations factors became significantly more important looking forward, with brand (reputational impact) as the top-ranked driver and tenant attraction tied for third place; and (4) mitigation against risks such as resilience and anticipated compliance consistently increased in importance. This study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of past, present, and near-future sustainable real estate investment priorities, changing owner behaviors, and the perceived business case for building energy efficiency investments.

N2  - Energy use at the country level is largely influenced by residential energy use, and therefore, understanding household behaviour can contribute towards improving energy efficiency. With the UK target of net-zero emissions by 2050, an understanding of the factors that can reduce residential energy use may help policymakers design policies reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, we analyse the determinants of UK energy expenditure in 2011-2020, by examining the impacts of household factors, dwelling characteristics, and energy prices on household electricity and gas expenditure, separately for owner-occupied homes and rented accommodations. Our results suggest that renters are more sensitive to changes in electricity and gas prices than homeowners, by about 23% and 7% respectively. However, changes in income affect homeowners more than renters. Overall, the results suggest that the key drivers of electricity and gas expenditure are household size, number of rooms, and urban location, with homeowners generally being more sensitive. As renters are more price sensitive, we recommend that policymakers offer monetary or legislative incentives to landlords to make energy efficiency improvements in their rented properties, such as double glazing or solar panels. The government should also use our results to give households recommendations on energy conservation, promoting environmentally conscious behaviour.

N2  - The incremental market value of higher thermal efficiency standards in new houses, and the resulting energy savings, are estimated using linear regression techniques. Based on the empirical findings, a homebuyer discount rate is calculated and cost-effectiveness tests are performed. The findings indicate that the real estate market operates efficiently in capitalizing the value of energy savings into sale prices. It appears that under current pricing mechanisms the thermal performance improvements provide net benefits to the homebuyer and to the sponsoring utility.

AB  - Abstract: Since January of 2005, 250 building projects in the City of Singapore have been awarded the Green Mark for energy efficiency and sustainability. This paper analyzes the private returns to these investments, evaluating the premium in asset values they command in the market. We analyze almost 37,000 transactions in the Singapore housing market to estimate the economic impact of the Green Mark program on Singapore''s residential sector. We adopt a two-stage research design; in the first stage, a hedonic pricing model is estimated based on transactions involving green and non-green residential units in 697 individual projects or estates. In the second stage, the fixed effects estimated for each project are regressed on the location attributes of the projects, as well as control variables for a Green Mark rating. Our results suggest that the economic returns to green building are substantial. This is one of the first analyses of the economics of green building in the residential sector, and the only one analyzing property markets in Asia. Our results provide insight about the operation of the housing market in one country, but the policy implications about the economic returns to sustainable investments in the property market may have broader applications for emerging markets in Asia.

AB  - While many studies have shown that “green price premiums” accompany the development of green buildings, there is still significant doubt among the public as to the financial viability of investments in energy efficiency. In this paper, we examine this issue from the developers' perspective, and draw on data from Singapore's Green Mark (GM) system, which was introduced in 2005 to evaluate the sustainability and energy-efficiency of buildings. We find that the “green price premium” of residential developments arises largely during the resale phase, relative to the presale stage. The market premium of GM-rated units is about 10% at the resale stage, compared to about 4% during the presale stage. This implies that, while developers pay for almost all of the additional costs of energy efficiency during construction, they only share part of the benefits associated with such green investments. We also find no evidence that the development of green housing can immediately and significantly improve the corporate financial performance of Singaporean residential developers. These results provide the first evidence of the mismatch that developers face between outlays and benefits in the residential green building sector. This mismatch may impede further development of green residential properties. The emerging green real estate markets should be encouraged to introduce innovative business arrangements and financial products that allow residential developers to capture the future benefits associated with green properties.

AB  - Key words like sustainability, green building, energy efficiency, triple bottom line, and corporate social responsibility increasingly affect the real estate business and therefore most of the related decision making processes. But what effect does sustainability have on property market values? A lot of discussion and research has already been undertaken to analyze possible impacts of sustainable characteristics on property values. Until now, little significant quantitative empirical evidence has been found, and if so, it s usually related to US real estate markets and the sustainability certifications of LEED and Energy Star. In 2002, the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was adopted to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. The IMMOVALUE-project, granted by the program of Intelligent Energy Europe, analyzed the possibility of implementing characteristics of energy efficiency into property valuation practice using data from the mandatory energy-performance certificates. One result of the project was that if detailed property market data are available, multiple regression analysis in the framework of hedonic pricing models could be applied to consider, and empirically establish, the effects of energy efficiency characteristics on properties values. This article focuses on the possibility of integrating aspects of energy efficiency into income-related property valuation approaches. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - I estimate the energy efficiency premium in unlabeled office buildings by exploiting variation in mandatory building energy standard implementations, as a result of the U.S. 1992 Energy Policy Act. A more stringent energy code leads to rent and price premiums of approximately 4% and 9%, respectively. Significant heterogeneity in the rent premium is observed based on who pays the utility bills, as would be expected absent asymmetric information about energy conservation characteristics among real estate market participants. The rent and price premiums are larger in hotter, more humid climates, and are consistent with full capitalization of the energy savings from a more stringent standard.

N2  - This paper assesses whether commercial real estate participants are willing to pay a premium for an energy efficient building that has not received a green label. I utilize a unique dataset of detailed building-level observations and a spatial semiparametric matching framework that exploits quasi-experimental state-by-year variation in the implementation of mandatory building energy codes, to estimate selling price and rent premiums for a more stringent code. I find that buildings constructed under a more stringent energy code are associated with rent and selling price premiums of approximately 2.7% and 10%, respectively, compared to buildings constructed just before the code came into effect. When tenants pay directly for utilities, buildings constructed under an energy code are associated with 5.7% higher rents. These premiums are consistent with complete capitalization of estimated building-level savings, and there forecast doubt on the existence of an energy efficiency gap resulting from adverse selection between landlords and tenants in commercial buildings.

AB  - Problem, research strategy, and findings: Of the three primary components of housing affordability measures—rent, transportation, and utilities—utility costs are the least understood yet are the one area where the cost burden can be reduced without household relocation. Existing data sources to estimate energy costs are limited to surveys with small samples and low spatial and temporal resolution, such as the American Housing Survey and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey. In this study, we present a new method for small-area estimates of household energy cost burdens (ECBs) that leverages actual building energy use data for approximately 13,000 multifamily properties across five U.S. cities and links energy costs to savings opportunities by analyzing 3,000 energy audit reports. We examine differentials in cost burdens across household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and analyze spatial, regional, and building-level variations in energy use and expenditures. Our results show the average low-income household has an ECB of 7%, whereas higher income households have an average burden of 2%. Notably, even within defined income bands, minority households experience higher ECBs than non-Hispanic White households. For lower income households, low-cost energy improvements could reduce energy costs by as much as $1,500 per year. Takeaway for practice: In this study we attempt to shift the focus of energy efficiency investments to their impact on household cost burdens and overall housing affordability. Our analysis explores new and unique data generated from measurement-driven urban energy policies and shows low-income households disproportionately bear the burden of poor-quality and energy-inefficient housing. Cities can use these new data resources and methods to develop equity-based energy policies that treat energy efficiency and climate mitigation as issues of environmental justice and that apply data-driven, targeted policies to improve quality of life for the most vulnerable urban residents.

N2  - Strong rental protection in the affordable housing market often prohibits landlords from charging rental premiums for energy-efficient dwellings. This may impede (re)development of energy efficient affordable housing. In the Netherlands, affordable housing institutions regularly sell dwellings from their housing stock to individual households. If they can sell energy efficient dwellings at a premium, this may stimulate investments in the environmental performance of homes. We analyze the value effects of energy efficiency in the affordable housing market, by using a sample of 17,835 homes sold by Dutch affordable housing institutions in the period between 2008 and 2013. We use Energy Performance Certificates to determine the value of energy efficiency in these transactions. We document that dwellings with high energy efficiency sell for 2.0-6.3% more compared to otherwise similar dwellings with low energy efficiency. This implies a premium of some EUR 3,000 to EUR 9,700 for highly energy efficient affordable housing.

N2  - This study attempts to quantify the economic gains associated with investment in energy efficiency improvements (EEI) for commercial real estate. We discuss reasons and challenges associated with taking on this endeavor. Benchmarking the performance of these improvements is discussed through an explanation of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. A series of projects for which investment in EEI has been conducted are reviewed. While data limitations preclude the ability to generalize our results, we believe they demonstrate an area of real estate investment that should not be overlooked. The findings should appeal to owners and operators of commercial real estate, as well as tenants who occupy space in these buildings.

AB  - Abstract Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) were introduced by the European Union as a transparency tool in order to meet the targets of reducing the energy consumption of buildings. However, several inefficiencies hindered their implementation, resulting in a recast of the corresponding Directive coming into force in Germany in 2014. In 2012, Amecke (2012) was predicting that a "fundamental change" would occur due to the upcoming improvement of EPCs' legal status. This follow-up investigation proves Amecke's assumption and expands the examination by comparing different target groups (tenants vs. owners) and elicitation methods (indirect approach via choice-based conjoint analysis vs. direct approach via self-explicated method). We analyzed the survey responses of 206 participants (108 tenants, 98 owners), which had been collected between May and July 2017. The results of the indirect approach suggest an ongoing change in the housing market, as energy efficiency achieves a high importance score similar to that of rent resp. price and of location. Owners are significantly more familiar with the EPC tool, giving it stronger consideration than tenants do. The results indicate three main policy implications concerning enhanced (i) transparency regulation and its compliance, (ii) environmental awareness, and (iii) communication of economic incentives. Highlights • The EPC is no longer of minor importance in residential real estate decision-making. • The influence of energy efficiency is analyzed by a direct and an indirect (CBC) method. • Owners are more familiar with EPCs than tenants are and give it stronger consideration. • Key success factors for EPCs are transparency regulation and environmental awareness. • The role of the EPC can be further strengthened by implementing a financial indicator.

AB  - Whether commercial real estate market participants effectively evaluate building energy efficiency characteristics in the absence of a green label has so far remained unaddressed in the literature. I estimate the energy efficiency premium in unlabeled office buildings by exploiting variation in mandatory building energy standard implementations as a result of the 1992 U.S. Energy Policy Act. A more stringent energy code leads to rent and price premiums of approximately 4 percent and 9 percent, respectively. Heterogeneity in the rent premium is also observed based on who pays the utility bills, as would be expected if market participants correctly evaluate energy conservation characteristics. The rent and price premiums are consistent with full capitalization of the energy savings from a more stringent standard. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract With the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions and curbing climate change, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings with energy efficiency retrofits is an important task. In Germany a large share of the residential building stock is rented. This comes with barriers to energy efficiency retrofitting due to split incentive problems. Alongside existing government incentive programmes, the German tenancy law allows landlords to add a maximum of 11% of the energy-related modernisation costs onto the annual rent. Studies evaluating the actual outcomes, from an energy as well as a social point of view, are rare. This article compares calculated theoretical heating energy consumption for prior to and after retrofit with actual consumption data after retrofit. Further, the issue of household expenses is addressed by comparing increased rental costs after retrofit with household's energy expenses prior and after retrofit. Despite a reduction in energy consumption of 70%, more than half of the households faced increased costs due to higher rents after retrofit. Even when increases in energy prices are taken into account, still one third of the households faced higher costs. For a fairer and more effective distribution of costs and benefits, this article stresses the importance of alternative financing models. Highlights • Tenants often do not profit from energy efficiency retrofits in financial terms. • Households with low energy consumption are disproportionately affected. • Alternative financing models are needed for more efficient and fair retrofit policies.

N2  - Home energy rating systems are popular and widely used programs to encourage energy efficiency in the residential housing market. With the actual rating perhaps conveyed to prospective buyers as a posted label, these rating systems offer a variety of benefits. This paper focuses on the ability of these systems to help buyers identify more quickly the properly priced house. An economic search model is applied to a unique sample of energy-efficient homes in Minnesota. The search benefits are modest but positive in our case study, but could be larger in a more diverse housing market.

AB  - The article offers information on growing demand of energy for commercial real estate owners and operators. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), energy cost remains the single largest operating expense for commercial buildings accounting about 30 percent of operating costs. It is noted that public utilities commissions encourage energy efficiency to decrease demand of electricity.

AB  - ABSTRACT We investigate whether mandatory energy performance certificates of existing residential properties contribute to property price premiums after the implementation of the EU directive on the energy performance of buildings in the Swedish private housing market. Analysing mandatory energy performance certificates of the 2009-2010 private housing transactions, we find that energy performance is associated with transaction price in situations when it is conditional on a reference benchmark. We also document property price premiums for energy performance within housing segments built before 1960 and those with a lower transaction price per square metre. Our results suggest that the property market values energy performance, and we make recommendations on which housing segments need policy support to encourage energy improvements.

AB  - Abstract: The Directive 2002/91/CE introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), an energy policy tool. The aim of the EPC is to inform building buyers about the energy performance and energy costs of buildings. The EPCs represent a specific energy policy tool to orient the building sector and real-estate markets toward higher energy efficiency buildings. The effectiveness of the EPC depends on two factors: [•] The accuracy of energy performance evaluation made by independent experts. [•] The capability of the energy classification and of the scale of energy performance to control the energy index fluctuations. In this paper, the results of a case study located in Italy are shown. In this example, 162 independent technicians on energy performance of building evaluation have studied the same building. The results reveal which part of confidence intervals is dependent on software misunderstanding and that the energy classification ranges are able to tolerate the fluctuation of energy indices. The example was chosen in accordance with the legislation of the Emilia-Romagna Region on Energy Efficiency of Buildings. Following these results, some thermo-economic evaluation related to building and energy labelling are illustrated, as the EPC, which is an energy policy tool for the real-estate market and building sector to find a way to build or retrofit an energy efficiency building.

AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are intended to provide tenants and buyers with reliable information about the energy performance of buildings. As improved energy performance may increase building sale prices and rents, the EPCs are supposed to generate incentives for owners to invest in energy efficiency. The empirical evidence for a price premium associated with energy labels is, however, inconclusive and partly contradictory. By utilizing data from the Norwegian housing market, we reproduce the positive price premium effect found in earlier studies. However, when we check these results by taking advantage of the fact that the introduction of a mandatory energy certification system represents a quasi-natural experiment, we find no evidence of a price premium. On the contrary, we present evidence that there is no effect of the energy label itself. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - Purpose: A number of studies have investigated the relationship between energy performance certificates (EPCs) and house prices. A majority of studies have tended to model energy performance pricing effects within a traditional hedonic conditional mean estimate model. There has been limited analysis that has accounted for the relationship between EPCs and the effects across the pricing distribution. Moreover, there has been limited research examining the "standard cost improvements EPC score", or "potential score". Therefore, this paper aims to quantify and measure the dynamic effects of EPCs on house prices across the price spectrum and account for standardised cost-effective retrofit improvements. Design/methodology/approach: Existing EPC studies produce one coefficient for the entirety of the pricing distribution, culminating in a single marginal implicit price effect. The approach within this study applies a quantile regression approach to empirically estimate how quantiles of house prices respond differently to unitary changes in the proximal effects of EPCs and structural property characteristics across the conditional distribution of house prices. Using a data set of 1,476 achieved transaction prices, the quantile regression models apply both assessed EPC score and bands and further examine the potential EPC rating for improved energy performance based on an average energy cost improvement. Findings: The findings show that EPCs are valued differently across the quantiles and that conditional quantiles are asymmetrical. Only property prices in the upper quantiles of the price distribution show significant capitalisation effects with energy performance, and only properties with higher EPC scores display positive significant effects at the higher end of the price distribution. There are also brown discount effects evident for lower-rated properties within F- and G-rated EPC properties at the higher end of the pricing distribution. Moreover, the potential energy efficiency rating (score) also shows increased effects with sales prices and appears to minimise any brown discount effects. The findings imply that energy performance is a complex feature that is not easily "averaged" for valuation effect purposes.

N2  - In the European Union, Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) provide potential buyers or tenants with information on a property's energy performance. By mitigating informational asymmetries on real estate markets, the conventional wisdom is that they will reduce energy use, increase energy-efficiency investments, and improve social welfare. We develop a model that partly contradicts these predictions. Although EPCs always improve social welfare in the absence of market failures other than asymmetric information, their impact on energy use and investments is ambiguous and depends both on the time horizon considered and the distribution of energy needs in the population. This implies that, in a second-best world where energy externalities are under-priced, EPCs can damage social welfare.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the impact of the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) on the Italian real estate market, focusing on old buildings. The contribution of EPC labels to house prices and to market liquidity was measured to analyze different aspects of the selling process. Design/methodology/approach: A traditional hedonic model was used to explain the variables of listing price, transaction price, time on the market and bargaining outcome. In addition to EPC labels, the building construction period and the main features of apartments were included in the model. A sample of 879 transactions of old properties in Turin in 2011-2014 was considered. Findings: A first hedonic model let us suppose that low EPC labels (E, F and G) were priced in the market although EPC labels explained only 6-8 percent of price variation. A second full hedonic model, which included apartment characteristics, revealed that EPC labels had no impact on prices.

AB  - This paper investigates the effect of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings on residential prices in Wales. Drawing on a sample of approximately 192,000 transactions, the capitalisation of energy efficiency ratings into house prices is investigated using two approaches. The first adopts a cross-sectional framework to investigate the effect of EPC rating on price. The second approach applies a repeat-sales methodology to investigate the impact of EPC rating on house price appreciation. Statistically significant positive price premiums are estimated for dwellings in EPC bands A/B (12.8%) and C (3.5%) compared to houses in band D. For dwellings in band E (−3.6%) and F (−6.5%) there are statistically significant discounts. Such effects may not be the result of energy performance alone. In addition to energy cost differences, the price effect may be due to additional benefits of energy efficient features. An analysis of the private rental segment reveals that, in contrast to the general market, low-EPC rated dwellings were not traded at a significant discount. This suggests different implicit prices of potential energy savings for landlords and owner-occupiers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Energy poverty (EP) is the product of three main factors – the cost of energy, household income and the energy efficiency of the dwelling. Climate change and rising energy costs are likely to accentuate EP. This study extends our knowledge about EP in Australia and examines its relationship to housing and health. Drawing on 23 semi-structured interviews, we map the impacts of EP on older low-income people residing in Sydney and Melbourne. These impacts include food insecurity, an incapacity to purchase essential consumer items, an inability to afford required medical procedures, thermal discomfort and social exclusion. We found that many interviewees do not recognize their own EP situation or are too ashamed to ask for help. Thus, the overall cost of EP to individuals and the broader society can be far higher than what statistics indicate. The article proposes a conceptualization of the relationship between housing, health and EP drawing on a figure we have created. The severe impacts of EP suggest that measures to lessen it among older vulnerable households are urgently required. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - A price reform in Turkey increased the residential electricity tariff by more than 50 percent in 2008. The reform, aimed at encouraging energy efficiency and private investment, sparked considerable policy debate about its potential impact on household welfare. This paper estimates a short-run residential electricity demand function to evaluate the distributional impact of the tariff increase. The analysis allows heterogeneity in households' price sensitivity and the model is estimated using a nationally representative sample of 8,572 Turkish households. The results suggest that rich households in Turkey are three times as responsive in adjusting consumption to price changes as poor households are. In addition, the welfare loss of the poorest income quintile--measured by the change in consumer surplus as a percentage of income--is 2.9 times that of the wealthiest.

AB  - Abstract: This study computes the pure technical efficiency (PTE) and energy-saving target of Taiwan's service sectors during 2001–2008 by using the input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with the assumption of a variable returns-to-scale (VRS) situation. This paper further investigates the effects of industry characteristics on the energy-saving target by applying the four-stage DEA proposed by Fried et al. (1999). We also calculate the pre-adjusted and environment-adjusted total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores in these service sectors. There are three inputs (labor, capital stock, and energy consumption) and a single output (real GDP) in the DEA model. The most energy efficient service sector is finance, insurance and real estate, which has an average TFEE of 0.994 and an environment-adjusted TFEE (EATFEE) of 0.807. The study utilizes the panel-data, random-effects Tobit regression model with the energy-saving target (EST) as the dependent variable. Those service industries with a larger GDP output have greater excess use of energy. The capital–labor ratio has a significantly positive effect while the time trend variable has a significantly negative impact on the EST, suggesting that future new capital investment should also be accompanied with energy-saving technology in the service sectors.

AB  - Assessing the environmental impact due to consumption of goods and services is a pivotal step towards achieving the sustainable development goal related to responsible production and consumption (i.e. SDG 12). Household appliances plays a crucial role and should be assessed in a systemic manner, namely considering all life cycle stages, technological efficiency, and affluence aspects. The present study assess the impact of such household appliances used in Europe, and tests scenarios of potential impact reduction at various scales. Life cycle assessment is applied to 14 different household appliances (ranging from dishwashers to television devices) selected to build a set of representative products, based on their economic value and diffusion in households in Europe. Related impacts are calculated with the Environmental Footprint method for calculating a Consumer Footprint "appliances" for the baseline year 2010. A number of scenarios encompassing eco-solutions on a technical level, changes in consumption pattern, behavioral changes, as well as the combination of all these aspects are run to estimate the Consumer Footprint related to household appliances for the year 2030, compared against this baseline scenario. The baseline Consumer Footprint is confirming the importance of the use phase in leading the impacts in almost all impact categories. Testing different scenarios concludes that there is a reduction of the impact for most of the categories (with up to 67% for the ozone depletion potential, and still around 35% for the global warming potential), while two of the here examined impact categories (i.e. land-use and mineral resource depletion) show an overall potential that is even negative – i.e. the results of all scenarios are higher than the ones of the 2010 baseline scenario. The increase in purchase and use of such appliances may offset energy efficiency benefits in some of the examined categories. Hence, the assessment of sustainability of appliances consumption should always include several scales, from the efficiency of the products (micro scale), to the improvement of the energy mix (meso scale), up to accounting for socio-economic drivers and patterns of consumption affecting the overall appliances stock (macro scale). Image 1 • Life cycle-based assessment of household appliances consumption by an average European citizen. • Testing of eco-innovations scenarios due to technological and consumers' behavior changes. • Total reduction potential due to eco-innovations for 2030 reaches 35% for the Global Warming Potential. • Relevant role of the underpinning energy mix is highlighted. • Increased usability contributes least to the overall potential among the tested scenarios.

N2  - This article provides new insights into the performance of commercial real estate, focusing on the environmental performance of institutional assets. The authors employ a proprietary dataset of energy consumption data that includes more than 26,000 buildings between 2009 and 2018. They document that, in their sample of commercial real estate, the median energy intensity decreased by more than 40% over the decade. Using a difference-in-difference analysis, the authors find that adoption of environmental building certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is associated with significantly lower energy consumption and that there is substantial variation in these effects, depending on certification level and program, and label tenure. Moreover, specific interventions aimed at improving the energy efficiency of buildings considerably reduce ex post energy consumption, with effects varying based on local climatic conditions.

AB  - Now, what you're seeing is the guys in the sustainability department maybe won an internal battle because the word on the street now is that a lot of consumer packaged goods companies are willing to pay a premium, a green premium for recycled plastics over virgin product, which was something that was, I would say, unheard of five or six years ago. B [00:04:30] Bill: b Yes, I will do my best to be a good spokesperson for the company. But when you think about materials that either go from primary or secondary packaging to a manufacturing enterprise, then they're packaged, then they show up at a retailer and they're packaged to go to a retailer, and they're packaged and put on a shelf and then they get to someone's house. There are clearly times when I wish that instead of selling the business to another large strategic company that we'd had another few years to continue to run that company as a private entity, because I think there's a lot more potential that we could have unlocked.

N2  - This dissertation is comprised of three essays on energy and environmental economics. The first two essays of this dissertation examine sectoral energy consumption in the State of Hawai'i. My first essay focuses on the intermediate demand for energy consumption by economic sectors. I model Hawai'i's economy in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework and follow the footprint of efficiency improvement in the economy by looking at the energy flows in Hawai'i's economy. Assuming a "free" technological change becoming available to firms, this essay ranks the economic sectors with respect to their saving potential. While there are currently some energy efficiency rules and incentives in place, this essay provides insights to design alternative sector-specific energy efficiency policies that could help to achieve the State's goals. My results identify hotels, construction, accommodations, restaurants, and retail trade as the key sectors to be targeted for a successful sector-specific energy efficiency program. The above-mentioned sectors together comprise 56% of total potential reduction in energy use and GHG emissions in Hawai'i's economy. In the second essay, I turn my attention to final energy consumers, contributing toward the understanding of electricity and fuel use associated with residents and visitors of Hawai'i. Using an Input-Output model, I analyze the difference in total energy consumption--both direct purchases and indirect demand for energy through purchases of other goods and services--of residents and visitors. I run the same analysis using both 2007 and 1997 data set to compare the consumption pattern change over time. My results show that on a per-capita basis, residents tend to consume more electricity through spending on health services, real estate rentals, professional services, and trade, while top visitor electricity-intensive expenditures include hotel, restaurants, trade (shopping), and tourism services (museums, tours and travel agencies). The results for 1997 and 2007 show a remarkable difference between residents and visitors: while total demand for fuels and electricity increased by 18% and 33%, respectively, for residents, they both fell by 4% and 9%, respectively, for visitors. Adjusting for population change, per-capita results reveal the same pattern but different magnitudes. Therefore, I conclude that the tourism industry has improved efficiency in both fuel and electricity usages by decreasing energy intensity of their activities over the observed decade. During the observed 10-year period, energy-use visitor factor dropped for fuel from 3.5 to 2.5 (a 28% drop) and for electricity from 2.4 to 1.5 (a 38% drop). Finally, to assess the underlying driving forces influencing the observed changes in energy consumption in Hawai'i, I used a decomposition methodology to explain the changes in sectoral energy demand between 1997 and 2007 in terms of activity, structure, and intensity effects. The findings indicate that the activity effect contributed greatly to the observed growth in energy consumption, that the structural effect was small, and that the reduction in energy intensity by sector was a clear signal of improvement in energy efficiency. Finally, in my third essay, I look into the controversial topic of climate policy under uncertainty. The literature on hybrid climate policy could be divided in two groups: studies of one group discuss the welfare-enhancing features of hybrid policies in a qualitative framework, while the others compare the policies by measuring welfare loss in a stochastic dynamic setting. My third essay seeks to contribute to the literature by providing a theoretical welfare analysis for optimal hybrid policy under uncertainty. Moreover, I contribute to the U.S. climate policy literature using a numerical example. In this essay, I bypass the conventional price and quantity mechanisms and focus on the two common hybrid policies: Two-Step Carbon Tax as a price-driven mechanism, and Cap-and-Trade with Allowance Reserve, as a quantity-driven mechanism. I first solve for the optimal policy parameters in the context of climate change and then set the model's parameters to U.S.-specific values to quantify the solutions and compare them with respect to their expected welfare loss. The numerical analysis ranks the two-step tax policy above the cap-and-trade with allowance reserve in terms of social welfare loss, given the same cost and uncertainty parameters.

N2  - In this dissertation I explore two aspects of the economics of energy. The first focuses on consumer behavior, while the second focuses on market structure and firm behavior. In the first chapter, I demonstrate evidence of loss aversion in the behavior of households on two critical peak pricing experimental tariffs while participating in the California Statewide Pricing Pilot. I develop a model of loss aversion over electricity expenditure from which I derive two sets of test able predictions. First, I show that when there is a higher probability that a household is in the loss domain of their value function for the bill period, the more strongly they cut back peak consumption. Second, when prices are such that households are close to the kink in their value function--and would otherwise have expenditure skewed into the loss domain--I show evidence of disproportionate clustering at the kink. In essence this means that the occurrence of critical peak days did not only result in a reduction of peak consumption on that day, but also spilled over to further reduction of peak consumption on regular peak days for several weeks thereafter. This was similarly true when temperatures were high during high priced periods. This form of demand adjustment resulted in households experiencing bill-period expenditures equal to what they would have paid on the standard non-dynamic pricing tariff at a disproportionate rate. This higher number of bill periods with equal expenditure displaced bill periods in which they otherwise would have paid more than if they were on standard pricing. In the second chapter, I explore the effects of two simultaneous changes in minimum energy efficiency and Energy Star standards for clothes washers. Adapting the Mussa and Rosen (1978) and Ronnen (1991) second-degree price discrimination model, I demonstrate that clothes washer prices and menus adjusted to the new standards in patterns consistent with a market in which firms had been price discriminating. In particular, I show evidence of discontinuous price drops at the time the standards were imposed, driven largely by mid-low efficiency segments of the market. The price discrimination model predicts this result. On the other hand, under perfect competition, prices should increase for these market segments. Additionally, new models proliferated in the highest efficiency market segment following the standard changes. Finally, I show that firms appeared to use different adaptation strategies at the two instances of the standards changing.

N2  - This dissertation is composed of four chapters. The first chapter provides an overview of my dissertation and summarizes the key results of the proceeding chapters. The second chapter, which I title "Consumer Heterogeneity and the Energy Paradox," analyzes how households value energy efficiency when they buy a new car. The third chapter, titled "Designing Efficient Markets for Carbon Offsets with Distributional Constraints," studies the relative efficacy of three policies--baselines, trade ratios and limits--for alleviating the problem of adverse selection in markets for carbon offsets. The forth chapter, currently titled "On the Importance of Baseline Setting in Markets for Carbon Offsets," evaluates the relative magnitudes of over-credited, non-additional offsets and under-credited emissions reductions. The second chapter presents an analysis of the energy paradox with a focus on how consumers vary in their preferences for energy cost savings. By formulating a mixed logit discrete choice model of new vehicle demand that accounts for unobserved product characteristics, I estimate the distribution of household willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reducing gasoline costs by one dollar. While I find that the average household puts equal weight on vehicle price and fuel cost, I find significant heterogeneity in WTP where a non-trivial fraction of households appear to be inattentive to fuel cost differences. Encouraging these households to fully value fuel costs generates welfare gains that are on the same order of magnitude as the cost of increasing fuel economy standards. By calibrating a simple model of the new vehicle market, I find, however, that existing policies for increasing fuel economy fall short of realizing these gains because the policies influence the purchase decisions of all households, including those that fully or overvalue fuel costs. The third chapter presents an assessment of the relative efficacy of three key instruments--baselines, trade ratios and limits--which are under policy discussion in the design of carbon offset programs. We rank the instruments by their implications for total emissions, economic efficiency, and efficiency gain relative to a distributional transfer from capped to uncapped sectors. We find that the baseline is the best instrument for maximizing welfare as it directly reduces the share of offsets that are non-additional and that second-best policies do not sacrifice much welfare relative to the standard first-best policy prescription. In the fourth chapter, I develop a unified framework that considers the supply of offsets within a cap-and-trade program that allows us to compare of the relative impact of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions on overall emissions under different levels of baseline stringency and carbon prices. I find that the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets can be fully balanced out by under-credited emissions reductions without sacrificing a significant portion of the overall supply of offsets, provided emissions baselines are stringent enough. Under a medium-run reduction target of two billion tons of CO2 equivalent, to maintain the environmental integrity of the program, baselines need to be set to 70 percent of predicted business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. Moreover, as the carbon market achieves higher equilibrium prices, less stringent baselines can balance out the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions.

N2  - Manuscript 1 is titled, "Household demand for water in rural Kenya", and is coauthored with Joseph Cook and Peter Kimuyu. In this manuscript we use a household survey from 387 households in rural Kenya to model source choice and water demand using a discrete-continuous (linked) demand model. We find that households are sensitive to the price, proximity, taste, and availability in choosing among sources, but are not sensitive to other source qualities including color, health risk, and risk of conflict. We use the linked demand framework to estimate own-price elasticities in the rural setting. These range between -0.13 and -1.33, with a mean of -0.56, consistent with other estimates from small and large cities. Manuscript 2 is titled, "Energy efficiency information asymmetries in the rental housing market", and is a solo work. In this manuscript I exploit the variation in payment-status (who pays the energy bill), to estimate the effect of information asymmetries on the adoption of efficient (Energy Star rated) technologies in the U.S. rental housing market. Results show that, contrary to previous findings, landlords who pay their tenant's energy bill are no more likely to install energy efficient technologies, suggesting that information asymmetries play a nominal role in the adoption of efficient technologies in the rental housing market. Manuscript 3 is titled, "A linked-demand model to characterize multiple discrete-continuous demand", and is coauthored with Joseph Cook. In this manuscript we develop a reduced form multiple discrete-continuous demand model. Using this model we analyze weekly household demand for water in rural Ethiopia, and characterize four important aspects of demand: (1) total household water demand, (2) source-specific household demand, (3) aggregate water demand at each source, and (4) household preferences across source attributes. Results show that households value water quality, proximity and price in choosing which sources to collect from. Average own-price elasticity estimates from the aggregate demand analysis are found to be -0.18, and are consistent with other own-price elasticity estimates from middle- and low-income countries.

N1  - Accession Number: 1747145; Keywords: Apartment;  Energy;  Hedonic;  Housing;  Labeling;  Nuclear;  Power Plant; Geographic Descriptors: S. Korea; Geographic Region: Asia; Publication Type: Dissertation; Update Code: 20181220
N2  - In my dissertation, I measure the value of non-market amenities such as environmental quality using the hedonic pricing method in all three chapters. In Chapter 2, the study examines the price premium from Korea's Energy Efficiency Grade Label. The Korean government recently began energy certification of televisions, providing a setting to analyze a possible price effect of the new label. Hedonic regression results seem to show that a price premium exists for products with the Energy Efficiency Grade Label. However, potential unobserved heterogeneity is a concern. Difference-in-difference and fixed-effects models are used to capture the net effect of the label by controlling for time and product differences. The results suggest that any price premium does not result from the energy efficiency label itself. Instead, energy-efficient products already had higher prices before the introduction of the energy efficiency label. The finding turns our attention to the importance of careful design of labeling programs. In Chapter 3, using the publicly available housing transaction data in Korea, the study estimates a fixed-effects model to examine the impact of industrial park openings on the housing market in Korea. This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, the availability of multiple transactions within apartment complexes makes it feasible to carry out a fixed-effects estimation and address unobserved heterogeneity across apartment complexes. Second, I trace the effect on housing values from the announcement stage to actual operation stage of industrial parks. Third, although most previous studies analyze U.S. housing market, I examine the Korean housing market. I find that people in general have positive expectations about parks opening at the time of announcement, but they do not want to be located in close proximity to the park. Furthermore, the housing price effects of announcement and actual start of operation differ. Local households react positively to the news of industrial park openings and remain positive by the time parks begin operation, but households in close proximity to industrial parks react relatively less positively at the time of announcement, and the decline in price premium becomes greater once parks begin operation. In Chapter 4, I examine the price effect of the Fukushima nuclear accident on the Korean housing market. The Fukushima nuclear disaster triggered by the earthquake and tsunami was an unfortunate accident that is recorded as the worst nuclear accident since the Chernobyl accident. Given the proximity of South Korea to Japan, Koreans were particularly more concerned about the severity of the accident and its environmental and health impacts. Uncertain events such as the Fukushima nuclear accident may cause households to re-evaluate the likelihood of environmental hazard and decrease the values of housing units that are located near the facilities. Current study analyzes how the Korean housing market responds to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, using publicly available housing transactions data. The study compares the prices of apartments located in the nuclear plant-possessing districts with those of the apartments located in adjacent districts. The results indicate that in reaction to the news of disaster in Japan, housing prices decreased radically in those districts with nuclear power plants.

N2  - The German government is aiming for a climate-neutral building stock before 2050 to meet the defined goals of the Climate Action Plan 2050. Increasing the building stock's energy efficiency is therefore a high priority, and investments by private homeowners will greatly influence this, as around 46.5% of German homes are owner-occupied. To identify the possible monetary benefits of investments in energy retrofits, we investigate whether energy efficiency is reflected in the property values of German single-family homes. Therefore, we examine potential heterogeneous effects across regions. With 422,242 individual observations on a 1 km^{2}-grid level from 2014 to 2018, this study adds to the extant literature by 1) examining the energy efficiency effect on housing values for the entire country and specifically investigating regional disparities in this context, and 2) estimating an energy efficiency value-to-cost ratio to compare housing values' increase with initial investment costs and future energy cost savings. Applying hedonic analysis, we find a positive relationship between energy efficiency and asking prices. If energy efficiency increases by 100 kWh/m^{2}a, prices increase by 6.9% on average. We also find evidence for regional disparities. The effects are significantly weaker in large cities than in other urban areas, whereas the impact in rural regions is much stronger. According to this, housing shortage and higher purchasing power per capita were identified as drivers for low energy efficiency premiums. Finally, there is evidence that about 98% of future energy cost savings are already reflected in a higher housing value under myopic expectations regarding future energy prices.

N2  - Requiring energy efficiency building codes raises housing prices (or the monthly rental equivalent), but theoretically this effect might be fully offset by reductions in household energy expenditures. Whether there is a full compensating differential or how much households are paying implicitly is an empirical question. This study estimates the net implicit price of energy efficient buildings codes, IECC 2003 through IECC 2006, for American households. Using sample data from the American Community Survey 2007, a heteroskedastic seemingly unrelated estimation approach is used to estimate hedonic price (house rent) and energy expenditure models. The value of energy efficiency building codes is capitalized into housing rents, which are estimated to increase by 23.25 percent with the codes. However, the codes provide households a compensating differential of about a 6.47 percent reduction (about $7.71) in monthly energy expenditure. Results indicate that the mean household net implicit price for these codes is about $140.87 per month in 2006 dollars ($163.19 in 2013 dollars). However, this estimated price is shown to vary significantly by region, energy type and the rent gradient.

One of its provisions is the extension of the federal terrorism insurance backstop program through 2014. In January 2007, energy-efficiency legislation was on Congress' first 100 hours agenda. The debate over the taxation of carried interest began when Rep. Sander Levin introduced legislation in 2007 that would tax carried interest as ordinary income for real estate partnerships.

The report reveals that major companies in real estate and construction industry miscalculated the cost and benefits of green building. The study suggests that the true cost difference of constructing sustainable buildings is only 5%, three times lesser than the estimated additional cost of 17%. In addition, the study also determined that only one out of seven industry respondents take part in green building programs.

AB  - This paper incorporates environmental psychology insights into a well-being framework related to the built environment to predict the relations between green buildings and their residents in terms of pro-environmental behavior and well-being. To test our predictions, we apply a generalized structural equation modelling technique to a household survey dataset collected from the Singapore private housing market. We find that green building residents have a higher assessment of their residential environment. This increases the level of their residential satisfaction, which subsequently enhances their quality of life and reduces their intention to move. We demonstrate that green buildings provide a supportive and educational environment for motivating and educating their residents to behave in a pro-environmental manner. Residents' improved pro-environmental behavior and enhanced well-being are attributed to some, though not all, green features. We find that tangible green features (i.e., greenery, ventilation, indoor environments, and waste facilities) have greater impacts on residents than intangible ones (i.e., energy efficiency and accessibility to public transport). The findings contribute ideas and solutions to the future development of green buildings by taking a social perspective to pursue urban sustainability. This paper also inspires future multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of urban studies, psychology, and behavioral science. • Social contribution of green building to well-being and pro-environmental behavior • Behavioral insights from environmental psychology in green building research • Tangible green features have greater impacts on residents than intangible ones.

AB  - Green building concept represents an important issue in Romania mainly after 2008, encouraged by rulings related to green buildings and also with 2020 strategy which are encouraging a trend of investment in this kind of buildings having in mind goals such as energy performance, energy efficiency, renewable energy and construction waste (or externalities). After a conceptual phase, people in Romania (inclusively investors in real estate) have shown, both as consumers and as society, an interest for green buildings, and so this is a big opportunity for real estate developers to extend their businesses. Our paper is focusing on what represents demand and offer in Romanian green buildings market. This increasing interest of real estate developers for green buildings makes up a new business perspective in Romania, as they have now through this a possibility to increase the value of their investment and in the same time but also to produce a type of more energy-effective buildings, with reduced ownerships costs. In conclusion, this paper highlights benefits of green buildings, in terms of reducing costs but also in terms of sustainability of the building. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The article discusses why the adoption of green building practices will be beneficial for the multi-family housing market in the U.S. It is predicted that the market will eventually embrace green initiatives because of limited natural resources and the possibility that the costs involved in building and operating multi-family structures will rise. Additionally, the U.S. consumers want more energy efficiency, more earth-friendly products and finishes that do not adversely affect their health.

AB  - The concept of green housing has been introduced in China to deal with climate issues in the housing sector. Green housing development requires a complex socio-technical transition based not just on green materials or technologies, but also, and most importantly, on the behavioural transition of housing market actors. Little is known about how Chinese real estate enterprises are responding to the green housing transition within a Chinese context. Addressing this gap, our research aims to determine whether, and to what, extent Chinese real estate enterprises are transitioning toward greener housing practices and what constraints may exist. This research gap is particularly pressing given the Chinese government's ambitions to promote energy efficiency in the new urban building sector by requiring 50% of urban new buildings to be green buildings by 2020 (NDRC, 2016). Our research reveals Chinese real estate enterprises face a dilemma of 'going green' and a range of institutional constraints that currently frustrate their uptake of green housing practices. Our research furthers knowledge on environmental and housing market governance within non-western and non-liberal contexts. • A stylised representation of the housing market as a specific institutional ensemble is depicted. • A range of institutional constraints to the green housing transition were identified. • Real estate enterprises face a dilemma of 'going green'. • A clear policy pathway should guide future market action to ensure long-term institutional change.

AB  - Different evaluation protocols were proposed to calculate the degree of sustainability of buildings and large-scale projects. In parallel, many studies focused on estimating the economic benefits delivered by green buildings according to the consumer choices using specific econometric models. The study aims to investigate the awareness of the benefits deriving from Green Mark-labeled buildings in Singapore through the application of the hedonic pricing method. In particular, the impact of the Green Mark was assessed in the multi-family building sector, starting from a transaction dataset of approximately 300,000 units sold between 2005 and 2017. Given the spatial complexity of the multi-family buildings market, spatial autocorrelation models were recommended. In particular, the spatial lag model (SAR) and the spatial error model (SEM) were applied. The paper implements the property valuation literature in the field of spatial econometrics related to sustainable certification. Besides, the research provided an assessment of the sustainability scheme over time, highlighting consumer behavior in different phases of the real estate market in Singapore. The results highlighted how spatial models filter the autocorrelation effect. As for the impact of Green Mark on the sale price of the apartments, the results confirmed that a green premium exists. • Econometric models investigate the appreciation of green buildings in Singapore. • Rosen's theory-based models were used to estimate buildings' green premium. • Spatial hedonic models control the phenomenon of spatial autocorrelation. • Consumers are aware of the benefits of Green Mark-rated buildings.

N2  - This research investigates the acceptability of energy efficiency policies among European households. Based on large-scale surveys in Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK, we use a discrete choice experiment to study the trade-offs made by households between various policy characteristics including policy target level, dependence on energy imports, policy instruments (education and information programmes, standards, taxation, energy consumption limit), costs to the household, and distribution of costs between households and other sectors. In particular, we investigate the role of trust in government and of environmental identity on the acceptability of these policy characteristics. Across the four countries, we find that households prefer effective policies, dislike personal costs, and prefer non-coercive to coercive instruments; further, trust in government helps make coercive policies such as taxes more acceptable, whereas higher environmental identity makes consumption limits more acceptable.

N2  - Energy-efficiency levels in housing vary considerably across Europe. Poor energy efficiency results in a number of social problems, including fuel poverty and ill health, as well as excess energy consumption which leads to high levels of energy-related environmental emissions; the policy context for these air pollutants is now well established. In light of these policy-drivers, this paper presents a cross-country analysis of housing conditions, energy-efficiency levels, affordability and satisfaction with housing in 14 European countries using longitudinal datasets from the European Community Household Panel for the years 1994-97. Very little empirical analysis of European housing conditions has been undertaken previously. The results indicate the existence of three main typologies in Europe as regards housing conditions, with serious housing deprivation in southern Europe, in terms of poor thermal efficiency, high fuel poverty, burdensome housing costs and low housing-satisfaction rates. In northern Europe, problems of damp and overcrowding are found, especially in the UK, Ireland, France and Belgium. The policy implications of these findings are outlined.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing global recognition of the need to reduce carbon emissions in response to climate change concerns. It is generally acknowledged that the energy efficiency of existing homes can be improved, but there are significant barriers to its uptake. In particular improving the energy efficiency of private rental housing presents unique policy challenges due to a split-incentive problem. This has prompted some governments to introduce programmes that encourage landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. While landlords are responsible for the purchase of many energy-consuming household appliances, tenants are responsible for energy bills. Since the landlord does not reap the immediate benefits of investment in energy-efficient equipment, the incentives motivating such investment are weaker than for homeowners. This paper aims to quantify the magnitude of the split-incentive problem in the Australian private rental housing market by invoking a modelling approach where energy expenditure is estimated as a function of housing tenure, dwelling type, location, climate and other socio-demographic variables. We find no evidence in support of the split-incentive hypothesis in Australia. The paper concludes that differences in housing policy arrangements could be critical to the presence and importance of split incentives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper studies the impact of energy efficiency on the unconditional distribution of residential property prices in Portugal. Using a dataset of more than 256,000 residential property sales from 2009 to 2013, a period that covers an economic depression, unconditional quantile regression analysis reveals that the responsiveness to energy efficiency improvements is different not only as we move from low- to high-priced residential units but also between apartments and houses. While apartments show a downward trend in the magnitude of energy efficiency coefficient estimates, the opposite occurs for houses. This last property type exhibits clear price discounts at the lowest quantiles of the price distribution, something that is not observable through conditional mean and quantile regression analysis. Our results suggest the existence of a different level of responsiveness to energy efficiency improvements in the Lisbon region when compared to the rest of the country and that the impact of the Energy Performance Certificate label increases throughout time across all price quantiles. As a by-product of this paper, an unconditional quantile price index shows how the impact of the crisis was not the same across different market segments, with more severe price decreases for low- than high-priced properties. • Energy efficiency impacts the distribution of residential prices in Portugal. • For higher prices, rewards for apartments (houses) decrease (increase). • Price discounts due to efficiency improvements are observed in low-priced houses. • The urban region of Lisbon provides increasing rewards as prices grow. • Price indexes signal a depressed market, especially for low-priced properties.

N2  - Widespread thermal refurbishment of existing buildings is essential for mitigating carbon emissions and energy poverty. Retrofitting for better energy efficiency in low-income rental housing comes up against the tenant-landlord dilemma, however; for renovation to be accepted by residents, rules for cost sharing and fair implementation are required. The present study employs structural equation modelling to analyse distributional and procedural preferences in a survey sample of 942 social welfare recipients in Austria. The distributional principles of polluter-pays and energy bill neutrality are preferred for allocating renovation costs. Equal-pay, ability-to-pay, and paying extra instalments to finance the renovation are only accepted for buildings in high need of renovation. Low-income renters welcome a wide range of procedural options, in particular, providing transparent and comprehensive information on the planned renovation and mitigating inconvenience during the construction phase. Psychological and relational capabilities play into these preferences: households holding pro-environmental attitudes favour polluter-pays to prevent free-riders. A frugal mindset, trust in the landlord and renter concerns make low-income renters endorse ability-to-pay to avoid being displaced to lower-grade dwellings on a discriminating housing market. The results suggest that distributional principles need not stand alone but could be combined. For instance, allocating the majority of renovation costs by polluter-pays, but a smaller share by ability-to-pay, may cushion disproportionate impacts on less affluent residents. Energy counselling could empower low-income renters to manage personal energy and renovation costs, and to build literacy about renovation benefits and legal claims to encourage their landlord to renovate.

AB  - Abstract: Buildings consume a major proportion of the electricity power in most cities, thus promoting building energy efficiency (BEE) will directly contribute to low carbon cities. Some studies suggest that the additional investment on BEE should be well paid off by higher selling prices or more savings in term of life cycle costing. Real estate developers are profit driven and working in a competitive environment. However, it appears that real estate developers are skeptical in entering the BEE market, which requires alternate theories to explain their behaviors. In this study, we attempt incorporating transaction cost economics (TCE) and game theoretical frameworks into the analysis. It suggests that the anticipated transaction costs entailed in the provision of BEE products due to such factors as bounded rationality, opportunism and contractual hazards, combined with the asymmetrical information in the BEE market have curtailed the developers’ interests. This study also leads to suggesting some policy recommendations to induce the developers entering into the BEE market by reducing the transaction costs. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Building energy benchmarking policies require owners to publicly disclose their building's energy performance. In the US, the adoption of such policies is contributing to an increased awareness among tenants and buyers and is expected to motivate the owners of less efficient buildings to invest in energy efficiency improvements. However, there is a lack of studies specifically aimed at investigating the impact of such policies on office buildings among major cities through quantitative analyses. In response, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the benchmarking policy on energy efficiency improvements decision-making and on real estate performances, by applying two interrupted time series analyses to office buildings in downtown Chicago. The initial results indicate a lack of statistically strong evidence that the policy affected the annual vacancy trend of the energy efficient buildings (represented by ENERGY STAR labeled buildings). However, the use of interrupted time series in a more in-depth analysis shows that the policy is associated with a 6.7% decrease in vacancy among energy efficient buildings. The study proposed a method to quantitatively evaluate the impact of energy policies on the real estate performance of office buildings, and the result confirms the positive impact of energy-efficient retrofits on the real estate performance. The study findings support the reasoning behind the owners' decision in implementing energy efficiency improvements in their office buildings to remain competitive in the market.

N2  - Purpose: This paper aims to estimate the green premium effect of retrofitted apartments in Bucharest and draw comparisons with international examples. Design/methodology/approach: A geo-referenced transaction database including information on whether the property had been retrofitted is utilised. The paper uses two approaches to test the green premium. One is a hedonic model controlled by areas to estimate the price incentive of a green building. The second is a STAR GLS model evaluating the diffusion effect of house prices spatially by sub-market and assessment upon the pricing effect of green characteristics. Findings: The authors' findings suggest a green premium in two Bucharest areas of between 2.2 percent and 6.5 percent. Spatial diffusion effects are shown to contribute positively to house prices, but the unobserved spatial component reduces this effect.

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to propose a decision support tool that would aid decision-makers to implement energy-saving measures efficiently in a corporate real estate. Design/methodology/approach – The tool consists of a system dynamic model that allows describing and quantifying the complex interaction between potential maintenance scenarios, external energy factors and case-specific conditions. In addition, to include the uncertainty of some of the input variables related to the external energy factors, Monte Carlo simulation has been applied. Findings – A case study of a city hall in The Netherlands showed the usability of the proposed tool. Over the selected period of 20 years, applying the chosen set of interventions, the simulation showed possible gains in the net present value and significant decrease of energy consumption and carbon emission. Municipal officials and consultants verified the tool for energy efficiency. Research limitations/implications – Although the tool has proved its functionality in one case study, to test its robustness, additional case studies would be preferable. Practical implications – The assessment tool can help organizations in assessing energy-efficient maintenance scenarios that include multiple technical energy efficiency interventions as a part of other maintenance activities. Originality/value – There are numerous ways to increase building’s energy efficiency, but a lack of knowledge is often hindering the enhancement of maximal benefits. A tool that would assess both financial and environmental benefits of potential technical intervention would provide useful insights into corporate’s real estate current and possible future energy performance. This would aid corporations in making better decisions regarding finances, and on the long run, it will bring an improved corporate image. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Majority of eco-tax incentives are provided at the local or state levels. They can be in the form of income tax savings, sales tax benefits, use tax exemptions and real estate tax abatements. Activities that may qualify a business for these tax incentives include initiatives to improve energy efficiency and using alternative energy sources.

N2  - Disclosure of energy performance certificates (EPCs) is often incomplete, which hampers their effectiveness in relieving information asymmetries between landlords and tenants in the housing market. Even when a certificate is available, landlords do not always disclose it. This contradicts the unraveling result, according to which all landlords should disclose quality information unless it is costly to do so. We leverage a cross-sectional dataset of residential rental advertisements from the Belgian region of Brussels to empirically evaluate incentives to disclose an EPC. We find that two fundamental assumptions for the unraveling result are not confirmed in our setting: tenants do not necessarily value energy performance of rental property and do not appear to rationally adjust their expectations when faced with dwellings that withhold their EPC. The paper formulates specific policy advice for reforming EPC mechanisms to increase disclosure rates.

AB  - Problem: The future of housing depends in part on innovation by homebuilders. Planners should know how to influence innovation in homebuilding in order to promote innovative practices that conserve the environment, improve quality, and reduce costs. Purpose: This article explains challenges involved in innovation in home building, as well as providing planners with strategies to influence innovation in the industry. Methods: I review the literature and identify sources of resistance to or acceptance of innovation in home building. I also report the results of two national surveys of innovation adoption and use regression analysis to test variables likely to inhibit or promote innovation. Results and conclusions: Small builders receptive to innovation are likely to be led by a technology champion and to build custom homes for a relatively affluent and informed clientele. These firms provide a likely audience for technology innovations that require more upfront investment, as with some green building products, but can be marketed as highly innovative to homebuyers interested in higher performance in energy efficiency, sustainability or durability. In order to impact a larger portion of the housing market, large production builders should be the target for innovations that contribute to affordability in entry-level homes or to energy efficiency, sustainability and durability in higher priced houses. Takeaway for practice: Planners aiming to encourage innovation in homebuilding should craft strategies that recognize the opportunities, the structure of the industry, and the factors influencing innovation adoption. Local builders with owners who champion innovation are good targets for demonstration programs that involve custom homes. Larger production builders will want strategies that can be replicated in multiple market areas, and are likely to avoid localities whose codes and regulations would require them to change their production models. Research support: This research was partially funded by the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Partnership to Advance Technology in Housing (PATH) program.

AB  - The residential sector is an important target area for achieving Europe's 2020 energy saving aims. There is virtually no evidence, however, of how incentives for attaining energy efficiency interact with countries' regional development aims. This article presents recent experiences from Estonia, where an energy renovation subsidy programme financed with carbon emission trading funds was carried out between 2010 and 2014. We show that despite equal access to subsidies for residents living in various places, a regionally unequal distribution of subsidies occurred. Empirical analyses confirm that low-performing regions acquire less public subsidy, thus adding another layer of regional inequality to existing socio-economic differences. Findings suggest that renovation subsidy distribution is related to regional socio-economic indicators and that real estate value explains 40% of subsidy distribution variations between regions. Although the energy policy goal of carbon conservation is important, ignoring the location and organisational capacity of local communities results in missed opportunities to mitigate growing regional disparities.

N2  - In response to a perceived shift towards green building practices and an increased focus on energy efficiency in commercial office facilities management, in this report I examine the barriers and drivers related to deep retrofits for the purpose of developing recommendations for increasing the energy efficiency goals of future retrofit projects. Centered on the Financial District in Toronto, Ontario, I integrate the existing literature, interviews, and local case studies to indicate the current environment for whole building energy efficiency reductions. Recognizing deep retrofits as relatively new to the commercial real estate market, my ideas and recommendations include: corporate social responsibility reporting to build tenant demand; an easily accessible national energy labelling system; improving tools for benchmarking and industry knowledge; and providing innovative financial incentives.

N2  - China is now the world's largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter, and the government is under tremendous pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. The heavy industry sector is the largest contributor to the growth of CO2 emissions. Investigating the driving factors of this industry's CO2 emissions has important practical value. This paper applies the geographically weighted regression model to survey this industry's CO2 emissions. Empirical results show that urbanization exerts a heterogeneous impact on CO2 emissions across provinces and regions. This is mainly due to the differences in urban real estate and transportation infrastructure investments. Economic growth drives CO2 emissions, and this effect varies significantly by region and province on account of the differences in fixed-asset investment. It is more reasonable for local governments to develop emerging economies based on their specific conditions. Energy efficiency has the highest impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region, because of the differences in R&D personnel investment and the number of patents granted. The energy consumption structure has the largest impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region since it consumes more coal. Environmental regulations have a greater impact on CO2 emissions in the western region due to the differences in investment for industrial pollution control.

AB  - The article reports on the emissions trading program of the government which aims to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emission in the U.S. In this program, regulated industries which reduce their emissions below the threshold could sell or trade their credits to other companies. The Acid Rain Program of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has led to the significant reduction of sulfur dioxide emission. The Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM) supports market-based incentives that encourage energy-efficiency improvements as well as federal funding of emissions trading research.

AB  - The article focuses on the energy efficiency improvements lobbied by the Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM) members in the U.S. Congress. Climate change is the top environmental issue in Congress as a result, the Administration and the Congress will likely make it a priority to pass legislation leading to reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The measure could impact the cost of building new and renovating existing buildings as well as the cost of operating multifamily and commercial structures. Measure to extend the energy efficient tax credits beyond the end of fiscal year 2008 has been progressing in Congress. IREM believes that incentives for energy-efficiency investments are the best way to promote conservation.

T1  - Is California More Energy Efficient than the Rest of the Nation? Evidence from Commercial Real Estate

N2  - California's per-capita electricity consumption is 50 percent lower than national per-capita consumption. Mild climate, deindustrialization, and its demographics explain part of this differential. California energy efficiency policy is often claimed to be another key factor. A challenge in judging this claim is the heterogeneity of the real estate capital stock. Residential homes differ along a large number of physical attributes. We access a proprietary dataset from a large hotel chain that allows us to evaluate the environmental performance of comparable commercial real estate across the United States. Controlling for climate conditions and geographic location, we document that California's commercial real estate stock is the most energy efficient at a point in time but this differential is quantitatively small. However, over the years 2007 to 2013, California's hotels achieved much greater energy efficiency progress than hotels in other states.

N2  - We look for evidence of capitalization of energy efficiency features in home prices using data from real estate multiple listing services (MLS) in three metropolitan areas: the Research Triangle region of North Carolina; Austin, Texas; and Portland, Oregon. These home listings include information on Energy Star certification and, in Portland and Austin, local green certifications. Our results suggest that Energy Star certification increases the sales prices of homes built between 1995 and 2006 but has no statistically significant effect on sales prices for newer homes. The local certifications appear to have larger effects on sales prices, and that effect holds for both newer and older homes. The estimated home price premiums from certification imply annual energy cost savings that are sizeable fractions of estimated annual energy costs for homes in our sample, in some cases even above 100 percent. This suggests that the certifications either embody other attributes beyond energy efficiency that are of value to homebuyers or that buyers are overpaying for the energy savings. Further research is needed to better understand how consumers interpret home certifications and how they value the combination of "green" characteristics that many of those certifications embody.

AB  - Purpose – Since 2009, all commercial buildings in Sweden should have undergone an energy performance rating in accordance with the European Union directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings. The main purpose of this rating is to illustrate a building's energy performance in an easy, straightforward manner. In doing so, it becomes easier for the actors on the real estate market to assess the building's energy performance, which in the end should be reflected in the capital value of the property. The aim of this paper is to study the EU Energy Performance Certificates' impact on office buildings' capital values. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper an econometric approach is used to estimate the energy performance impact on buildings' capital values. A panel data set was constructed using economic data from IPD Nordic and Energy Performance Certificates from the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. Findings – This study shows that a building's energy performance has no impact on its capital value. Research limitations/implications – There may be a selection bias in the sample as the study is dependent on data from IPD Nordic. Originality/value – This is one of the first papers that study the EU Energy Performance Certificates' impact on office buildings' capital values in Sweden. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The rented sector of the housing market is a key concern for policies trying to improve dwelling-level energy efficiency levels. Currently, stepping up energy efficiency levels in the residential sector is hindered by a number of uncertainties. For rental properties, this is complicated by the split incentive problem (i.e. landlords do not benefit directly from the savings arising from these investments). Instead, the benefits are enjoyed by the tenants of these upgraded properties via lower energy bills and/or enhanced thermal comfort. Hence, the only way to recoup the investments is typically for landlords to obtain higher rents. This study confirms that energy efficiency features, as measured by the Energy Performance Certificate rating, are positively associated with a small but significant influence on transaction prices and quoted rental prices. Conversely, there appears to be a price discount for dwellings in the lowest energy performance category. A model of time-on-market yields inconclusive results but there is some, albeit weak, evidence of a negative relationship between time-on-market and energy efficiency ratings as more energy efficient dwellings tend to lease up more quickly.

AB  - In the UK, the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) is used to rate the energy performance of existing dwellings whenever they are let or sold. This study investigates which of the inputs to SAP account for the most variance in energy rating across existing gas central heated houses in England. Data from the English Housing Survey (EHS) 2009 are used to generate a representative set of dwellings and variance-based global sensitivity analysis is then applied to assess each input's contribution to the variance in the calculated ratings. It is demonstrated that heating system efficiency, external wallU-value and dwelling geometry account for 75% of the variance of the energy rating of gas central heated houses in England. This suggests that improving heating system efficiencies and wallU-values of the worst performing dwellings will go a long way towards improving their energy rating and potentially reducing their energy consumption. It is also demonstrated that dwelling geometry has a much bigger influence on the calculated carbon emissions (accounting for 80% of the variance) than it does on the SAP energy rating (accounting for 30%), meaning that significant improvements in energy rating might not be accompanied by significant reductions in carbon emissions.

T1  - Limited Attention in the Housing Market: Threshold Effects of Energy-Performance Certificates on Property Prices and Energy-Efficiency Investments

N1  - Accession Number: 1877207; Keywords: limited attention, heuristic decision-making, price discontinuities, housing market, anchoring and adjustment, energy policy, energy efficiency, energy performance certificates, EPC; Publication Type: Working Paper; Update Code: 20210211
N2  - We study the effects of limited attention on property prices and energy efficiency (EE) investments in the housing market. Using a novel dataset, we analyse over 5 million residential property sale transactions in England and Wales, each containing information about sale price, property and location characteristics, and a mandatory energy performance certificate (EPC). The EPC includes a continuous energy cost rating (SAP rating) which is mapped into seven colour-coded rating bands (ranging from green A to red G). Applying a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), we document significant price discontinuities at the rating band thresholds. We estimate that--holding the underlying SAP score equal--being in a higher rating band increases the final sale price of a property between 0.8% and 2.5% ($2,000 and $6,625 based on average sale prices) depending on the threshold crossed. The presence of price discontinuities suggests that individuals are attentive to the simpler colour-coded rating band and partially inattentive to the more precise SAP rating. We present a simple model for estimating the degree of inattention and show that, for a given level of attention, rating bands reduce attention to the SAP rating by 25% on average. Importantly, the detected price discontinuities appear to influence market behaviour: Sellers whose property receives an EPC rating just below a threshold to the next-higher rating band are between 0.4% and 11% more likely to make last-minute EE investments before placing their property on the market. We discuss a number of recommendations of how to best leverage these threshold effects to improve policy design, which can be extended to other settings where the provision of simplified information creates reference thresholds.

AB  - Abstract Macroeconomic impacts such as changes in economic structures and employment are very important when evaluating the energy transition in societal terms. We employ a macroeconomic model that accounts for regional, economic and sectoral features. The model results show how the overall positive net impacts of the energy transition in Germany – energy efficiency and renewable energies - on economic growth and employment up to 2030 are distributed across sectors and regions. The biggest relative increases in value added occur in construction, real estate and electricity generation; the biggest decrease is in mining of lignite. Significant effects mainly result from changes in the heat and transport sectors, while the transition in the electricity sector entails smaller impacts. The latter are, however, relevant to the regional distribution: The model results suggest that especially northern and eastern German federal states will benefit economically from the energy transition because they offer attractive locations for investments. At the same time, these states are less affected by decreasing conventional energy generation. Moreover, the impact of rising electricity prices is less negative here than in the other federal states because of their lower electricity intensity in production. In summary, the energy transition represents an opportunity for these regions to strengthen their economies. Highlights • Macroeconomic model accounts for regional, economic and sectoral features • Overall positive macroeconomic net impacts of the energy transition up to 2030 • Main effects from heat and transport sector, smaller impacts from electricity sector • Main relative increase of value added in construction, main decrease in mining • Northern and eastern federal states benefit due to transition in electricity sector [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Key elements of present investment decision-making regarding energy efficiency of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings are the marginal costs of energy efficiency measures and incomplete knowledge of investors and architects about pricing, co-benefits and new technologies. This paper reports on a recently completed empirical study for the Swiss residential sector. It empirically quantifies the marginal costs of energy efficiency investments (i.e. additional insulation, improved window systems, ventilation and heating systems and architectural concepts). For the private sector, first results on the economic valuation of co-benefits such as improved comfort of living, improved indoor air quality, better protection against external noise, etc. may amount to the same order of magnitude as the energy-related benefits are given. The cost–benefit analysis includes newly developed technologies that show large variations in prices due to pioneer market pricing, add-on of learning costs and risk components of the installers. Based on new empirical data on the present cost-situation and past techno-economic progress, the potential of future cost reduction was estimated applying the experience curve concept. The paper shows, for the first time, co-benefits and cost dynamics of energy efficiency investments, of which decision makers in the real estate sector, politics and administrations are scarcely aware.

AB  - Energy labels have generally received positive response from consumers and have moved the market for white goods and cars in the direction of more energy-efficient products. On the real estate market, it was expected that an energy label, rating the energy performance of a property based on a national energy performance certificate (EPC) might receive similar response. However, in Denmark no response to the energy performance rating was observed for 15 years. This was a surprise considering that Denmark was the first country to implement an A to G rating of the energy performance of buildings. A statistical examination of data on property sales prices and energy performance ratings was carried out. All relevant property transaction data from 2007 till 2012 were examined and they showed that energy performance ratings had an impact on property sales prices. However, before June 2010, the impact was modest, whereas after June 2010 the impact of energy performance ratings on property sales prices increased significantly as a result of an EU requirement to display the energy performance rating in connection with property sales. On this background, it was concluded that a public display of the energy performance rating is fundamental for market response. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Research Question Although energy consumption, conservation, and policy have emerged as significant social and governmental concerns, existing literature and recent interviews with commercial real estate firms and their tenants in Sweden and the U.S. reveal that--even among firms with a demonstrated concern for environmental issues--the primary driver of corporate action remains the bottom line. In the contest between "sustainability" and profit, profit always wins. While consumer attitudes have evolved, business still perceives goals of energy reduction to be at cross-purposes with financial performance. Is there a way to demonstrate the financial results of sustainability initiatives in a way that can demonstrate a positive impact on the bottom line? Instead of accepting the idea that firms must choose either profits or "sustainability," we ask whether reframing the concepts of "energy conservation" or "energy efficiency"-- which tend to be perceived as limited to energy reduction-- with the idea of energy productivity, conceptualized as output per unit of energy, will reveal a nexus of aligned interests that can bring industry, government, and society to the same side of the table. Method and Data We focus on energy use in the commercial real estate sector in Stockholm, Sweden. The starting-point for this study's data collection is the Green Fingerprint (GFP)--a software application ('app') that was developed by Mestro, a software development firm, in partnership with Humlegården Fastigheter AB (Humlegarden), a commercial real estate firm. The app allows commercial real estate tenants to see the real-time energy consumption of their leased space for electricity, heat, and cooling. Humlegarden is the leading commercial real estate firm in Sweden with respect to both its technology and brand positioning focused on sustainability. Humlegarden measures the energy use of 45 buildings housing approximately 1000 tenants via sensors on heating, cooling and electrical systems. Measurements are taken every 10-15 seconds, resulting in more than 7 million data points daily. We had access to over 50GB of GFP (operational, tenant) data collected by Humlegarden that covered pre- and post-Green Fingerprint implementation, and were in regular contact with representatives of these firms including tenant firms throughout the process as we collected data, developed our insights, and formulated our recommendations. Summary of Findings We demonstrate that attempts to improve energy conservation through existing measures such as Kilowatt-hours (kWh) per-square foot or kWh-per-employee, although easy to obtain, can be detrimental to the bottom line, as they may actually encourage wasteful practices. Further, they suffer quickly from diminishing returns, making them less influential over time. However, energy productivity, with even a simple operationalization of revenue per kWh, overcomes this problem and, like other useful metrics, focuses attention on the efficient use of resources under management control. Like existing productivity measures with which managers are familiar, such as revenue-per-employee, energy productivity is a concept that is both intuitive and attractive to those who wish to increase profits. At the same time, increasing energy productivity has environmental benefits. We demonstrate that tremendous brand and commercial value awaits the firm and/or industry that can effectively operationalize the concept of energy productivity and make it a part of its business model and brand positioning. Key Contributions This research makes three important contributions: (1) the application of the concept of energy productivity to corporate marketing, (2) a simple operationalization focused on managerial action, and (3) an empirical investigation with data from real firms. Our results suggest that while energy is consumed, monitored, and managed at the building level, relevant comparisons of results across organizations (e.g. , in the same industry) is critical. For example, guest-nights/kWh may be appropriate for hotels. Industry-level measures of energy productivity address the four issues identified in the extant research: (1) by treating energy as a controllable factor of production, it instills a cost focus on managers; (2) by providing a relevant metric across comparable firms, it provides relevant social norms, while (3) absolute and average industry values provide a benchmark against which all firms can compare themselves, providing a clear framework for goalsetting; and finally (4) measures of energy productivity can be reported on a monthly or quarterly basis aligned with other typical managerial reporting and do not suffer the same floor effects found with existing measures. Overall, we offer a clear demonstration of the possibilities for firms and government in order to provide a path forward for future policies, procedures and protocols. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

The research covered the Sloneczne housing estate in Szczecin, in a situation where the property appraiser does not have access to the energy performance certificates of the estimated apartments as well as apartments taken for comparison. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between energy intensity and market value of residential units on the selected real estate market. The analysis will be based on data from the Price and Value Register of the County Office, a collection of statistics and public information as well as on the authors' own databases and research. Research methodology: A multidimensional analysis will be used to distinguish homogeneous groups of residential units due to their property attributes. The study will also employ a valuation model including energy intensity and time variables. Results: The study showed that building type is one of the features determining energy consumption by a building. Depending on the period, the introduced attributes explained the evolution of the unit price at 78%, 75% and 24%. The parameters of the variables Size, Neighborhood and Time were found to be statistically significant. What is more, in all three periods, the value of the residential unit was significantly affected by the type of building which determined the energy performance of the building.

AB  - Research background: The implementation of EU directives in national legislations imposes an obligation to monitor energy efficiency in every sector of the economy, including construction. In the era of energy conservation, which results from environmental requirements, as well as from constantly increasing energy prices, the energy consumption of premises and buildings becomes an important prerequisite for decision-making processes in the real estate market. There have also been changes in the provisions of the Act on Real Estate Management, which impose an obligation on the professional group of property appraisers to incorporate energy performance certificates for buildings and premises into the valuation process. Energy intensity in terms of the demand for heating of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units. Purpose: The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high-rise buildings) and the diverse distribution of units in the building, especially with regard to their exposure to the different point of the compass. The research covered the Słoneczne housing estate in Szczecin, in a situation where the property appraiser does not have access to the energy performance certificates of the estimated apartments as well as apartments taken for comparison. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between energy intensity and market value of residential units on the selected real estate market.

The parameters of the variables Size, Neighborhood and Time were found to be statistically significant. What is more, in all three periods, the value of the residential unit was significantly affected by the type of building which determined the energy performance of the building. Novelty: Energy intensity in terms of the heating demand of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units. The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high buildings) and the different location of units in a building, especially in relation to the directions of the world.

T1  - Modelling Industrial Energy Demand in Saudi Arabia

N2  - Between 1986 and 2016, industrial energy consumption in Saudi Arabia increased by tenfold, making it one of the largest end-use sectors in the Kingdom. Despite its importance, there appear to be no published econometric studies on aggregate industrial energy demand in Saudi Arabia. We model aggregate industrial energy demand in Saudi Arabia using Harvey's (1989) Structural Time Series Model, showing that it is both price and income inelastic, with estimated long-run elasticities of -0.34 and 0.60, respectively. The estimated underlying energy demand trend suggests improvements in energy efficiency starting from 2010. Applying decomposition analysis to the estimated econometric equation highlights the prominent roles of the activity effect (the growth in industrial value added) and the structure effect (the shift towards energy-intensive production) in driving industrial energy demand growth. Moreover, the decomposition shows how exogenous factors such as energy efficiency helped mitigate some of that growth, delivering cumulative savings of 6.8 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) between 2010 and 2016. Saudi Arabia implemented a broad energy price reform program in 2016, which raised electricity, fuel, and water prices for households and industry. The decomposition results reveal that, holding all else constant, higher industrial energy prices in 2016 reduced the sector's energy consumption by 6.9 %, a decrease of around 3.0 Mtoe. Saudi policymakers could therefore build on the current policy of energy price reform and energy efficiency standards to mitigate the rate of growth of industrial energy consumption, increase economic efficiency, and maintain industrial sector competitiveness.

N2  - Purpose--This study aims to investigate the relationship between energy performance and property sale price in the Belfast housing market. How energy efficiency is contributes to sale price and thus appraisal value is of growing concern. The obligatory measurement of energy efficiency in private dwellings seeks to encourage improvements in energy performance. This may be capitalised into property value and may stimulate demand for energy-efficient buildings. However, the relationship between energy performance and property value remains nebulous, complex and under-researched--in part due to data limitations. Design/methodology/approach--Using a hedonic pricing specification, this paper measures the effect of energy performance certificates (EPCs) on residential property value. It examines the relationship between 3,797 residential sales transactions across the Belfast housing market, showing the percentage effect on property value with respect to energy performance. Findings--The results indicate a small but positive relationship between better energy performance and higher selling prices. Nonetheless, the findings point towards strong preference, demand tastes and a complex intra-relationship between EPCs and their capitalisation into property value. Pertinently, the findings point towards any energy-efficient-related price effect affect to be marginal alongside more "quality"-based market behaviours.

AB  - The article reports that the modifications on the energy codes were approved at the International Code Council (ICC) hearings in October 2010 and will result in a 25-30% increase in energy efficiency over earlier code editions. The report says the full economic impact of these changes will be substantial and will surely make the adoption of the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) much more given to arguing. The commercial real estate industry and product manufacturers are just some of the beneficiaries of the ICC decision.

N2  - Policies affecting the cost of energy use provide correct incentives for technology choices only if there is a market reward for energy efficiency. We provide clean evidence for market efficiency by considering how heating technologies capitalize into house values using detailed Finnish register data on technologies in houses, transaction prices and socio-economic variables. We exploit variation in technologies that houses are locked into at construction time to identify the stand-alone value of having a cost-saving technology in the house. For the two main technologies, electric and district heating, the estimated price discount is 5-6% of the house value for electric heating, coming very close to the capitalized value of the cost differential obtained from external data on energy contract prices. Technologies act as "labels" with clear market valuation--the results support the idea that transparent energy-efficiency classification of houses capitalize into house prices.

AB  - Abstract: Energy efficiency in the residential housing market can play an important role in the reduction of global carbon emissions. This paper reports the first evidence on the market adoption and economic implications of energy performance certificates implemented by the European Union. The results show that adoption rates are low and declining over time, coinciding with a negative sentiment regarding the label in the popular media. Labels are clustered among smaller, post-war homes in neighborhoods with more difficult selling conditions. We also document that geographic variation in the adoption rate of energy labels is positively related to the fraction of “green” voters during the 2006 national elections. Within the sample of labeled homes, the energy label creates transparency in the energy efficiency of dwellings. Our analysis shows that consumers capitalize this information into the price of their prospective homes. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

N2  - Despite significant progresses in development of energy-efficient buildings (EEBs), energy demand in building sector is still drastically increasing. This paradox is conceptualized in this study as Inefficiency of Increased Building Energy Efficiency. Marketability failure of EEBs and inefficiency in integrated design approach are the main causes of this paradox. Compared to merely focusing on the energy-efficiency enhancement, increasing the number of EEBs with a better marketability via enhancement of their aesthetic features is proposed as a novel approach for energy demand reduction in the building sector. This article aims to first investigate the current stage of EEBs' adoption and the associated market barriers, and then to propose a multidisciplinary design approach to scrutinize the role of aesthetic features on buildings' marketability for development of effective policies. Conducted comprehensive survey among real-estate agencies across 26 UK cities reveals a negative correlation between the energy-efficiency and housing marketability. Moreover, house price and aesthetic features are understood as the most dominant parameters that impact individuals' buying decision. Any extra initial cost of EEBs over 3% is likely to face market resistance. Furthermore, strong empirical evidences have been found to confirm that the proposed approach has a substantial potential to increase the EEBs' number.

N2  - Using a unique dataset of 256,000 residential property sales for Portugal, this paper reveals a clear sales premium for energy efficiency, which is more pronounced for apartments (13%) than for houses (5 to 6%). Price premiums tend to increase from 2009 to 2013, a period in which the Portuguese housing market was depressed. Quantile regression reveals that, when compared with the rest of the sample, the group of the most energy efficient properties receives a statistically relevant price premium, that is mostly stable across the entire spectrum of the conditional price distribution. Cross-country comparisons suggest that energy efficiency price premiums are higher than those found for central and northern European markets. Illustrations on the effect of data issues in hedonic regression models are provided. They show how the use of appraisal prices and explanatory variables with measurement errors may seriously bias energy efficiency partial effect estimates. In contrast, the omission of variables associated with the quality of the properties has not produced relevant distortions. Finally, it became apparent that the use of smaller datasets would have produced similar results, as no significance inflation was produced by the Portuguese large scale dataset.

When asked his outlook for remodeling market, he replied that it is a cautious positive outlook due to a recovery in the housing market. He said that home improvement projects will likely deal more on being product-based as resurfacing cabinets, and replacing countertops. He noticed that projects tend to be focused more on energy-efficiency and structural integrity.

AB  - Following a significant period of uncertainty the UK Government has confirmed the changes that will be made to the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (CRC Scheme) in order to simplify it and reduce the administrative burdens it places on businesses. The CRC Scheme requires non-energy intensive organisations to measure and report on their energy consumption and purchase allowances for the amount of CO2 emissions associated with that consumption. The majority of the changes proposed will come into force from April 2014, however certain changes will come into effect from 1st June, 2013. Key changes for the real estate sector include the surprise abolition of the Performance League Table, the disapplication of the Landlord and Tenant Rule in respect of ground lease arrangements, and new rules in relation to CRC responsibility in Trust situations. The simplification of the CRC Scheme is to be welcomed as many businesses had struggled with its technical complexities, however, fundamental criticisms that the scheme is merely a tax remain. The Government will review the effectiveness of the simplified CRC Scheme in 2016. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: In this study, we first analyse energy-efficiency measures in existing electrically heated houses in Sweden from a societal economic perspective. Measures to a house envelopes and to energy supply chains are evaluated through a system analysis approach and we include the external costs of climate change and the effect of different Swedish climatic zones. We find that in a typical house from the 1970s, conversion from electric heating is highly motivated since the mitigation cost of conversion is lower than the estimated external costs of emitted CO2. Both conversions and house envelope measures are more motivated in the northern part of the country, where there is a higher heat demand. A successful implementation of changes requires them to be attractive for consumers to adopt. We therefore secondly analyse the economic conditions for Swedish house owners to implement societal economic cost-efficient measures. We include the economic influence of an investment subsidy for heating system conversion, an income tax deduction for changing windows, customer electricity tax, real estate tax and of the cost of purchased energy from different energy suppliers. Apart from the economics, several other factors affect a house owner''s decision to change heating systems. We therefore thirdly analyse house owners’ perceptions of different heating supply alternatives based on the results of two comprehensive questionnaires. These different perspectives are combined in a discussion whether the studied policy instruments encourage house owners to implement changes in accordance with the energy-efficiency goals of decision makers. We find that the investment subsidy could be useful to break the lock-in effect of resistance heaters, which house owners seemed to experience. The electricity tax makes heating systems in line with national goals more competitive and efficiency measures to the house envelope more profitable. The reduction of the electricity tax in the northern part of the country has the opposite effect. Also, the increase in real estate tax when implementing energy-efficiency measures gives a contradictory message. The price differences between energy suppliers has a larger impact on the house owners’ economic conditions than both subsidies and tax rate changes, and possibly also affect the house owner''s attitudes towards various systems.

AB  - Energy-efficiency levels in housing vary considerably across Europe. Poor energy efficiency results in a number of social problems, including fuel poverty and ill health, as well as excess energy consumption which leads to high levels of energy-related environmental emissions; the policy context for these air pollutants is now well established. In light of these policy-drivers, this paper presents a cross-country analysis of housing conditions, energy-efficiency levels, affordability and satisfaction with housing in 14 European countries using longitudinal datasets from the European Community Household Panel for the years 1994-97. Very little empirical analysis of European housing conditions has been undertaken previously. The results indicate the existence of three main typologies in Europe as regards housing conditions, with serious housing deprivation in southern Europe, in terms of poor thermal efficiency, high fuel poverty, burdensome housing costs and low housing-satisfaction rates. In northern Europe, problems of damp and overcrowding are found, especially in the UK, Ireland, France and Belgium. The policy implications of these findings are outlined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - How to induce households to install energy efficient technology remains a puzzle. Could an energy labeling requirement for residential real estate help? We propose that the salient color-letter grades on the English Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) served as targets, motivating vendors to invest in energy efficiency. To test our hypothesis we look to a random sample of over 16,000 homes in England. In the post-EPC data we find a cluster of homes with energy efficiency scores just above the D-grade threshold. This cluster was not present prior to the requirement, replicates in an independently-drawn random sample and is significantly larger amongst properties that can be identified as treated by the EPC requirement. We conclude that the EPC requirement induced investment, and hence that energy efficiency labels have potential to green the housing stock. We infer from our analysis how the design of the EPC could be altered to motivate greater investment in energy efficiency. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - India has demonstrated that it is possible to reduce energy demand and increase the energy efficiency of its buildings, particularly for air-conditioning appliances. Given the rapid and large expected increase in India's building stock over the next 20 or more years, the opportunity exists to make significant increases in overall energy efficiency and reduce energy demand through the application of its Energy Conservation Building Code that influences the design, construction and operation of buildings. However, the responsibility for this code resides with local authorities (urban local bodies) that currently lack sufficient incentive to implement and enforce it. To overcome this impediment, it is argued here that important benefits can be captured by local authorities to implement energy-conservation measures: increased revenues from taxes, improved attractiveness to business and citizens, and the introduction of automation to reduce transaction costs in the building-approval process. Large parts of the country's property (real estate) are yet to be built, providing a valuable opportunity to transition to low-energy and climate-friendly solutions in India's rapidly growing building stock.

According to the author, there is a need for organizations to make a stimulus payment on energy efficiency. He says political skills are needed to persuade management that some expense and capital items can be revenue-generating investments. He cites a study showing that institutional investors now consider energy efficiency into their real estate models.

AB  - Abstract The Chinese government conducted a policy experiment on real estate-led economic growth on such a massive scale, which is unprecedented. This paper empirically analyzes the impact of real estate investment on energy efficiency. Provincial level panel data of China during 2004–2012 was used for the analysis. Two-way Fixed Effect model was applied to test the impact of real estate investment on total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE). The findings in this paper are: a certain degree of the real estate-led model of economic development can improve TFEE of the economy. Developing countries can gain economic development and energy efficiency improvement simultaneously by developing the real estate industry to a certain extent. But the impact of real estate investment on TFEE exhibits a nonlinear characteristic, that is, when the real estate investment proportion exceeds the threshold value, the impact of real estate investment on TFEE will take a reversal; Except Beijing, Shanghai, Hainan and Zhejiang provinces, to some extent, improving real estate investment can be helpful to improve TFEE in most of China's provinces. Highlights • The Chinese government conducted a policy experiment of real estate-led economic growth and the scale is unprecedented. • The impact of real estate investment on TFEE exhibits an "inverted-U shaped" curve. • A certain degree of the real estate-led model of economic development can improve TFEE of the economy. • Except few provinces, most of the Chinese province are lying on the left side of the curve. • Panel data is used to assess the effect of real estate investment on TFEE.

AB  - Currently, global warming, frequent occurrence of extreme weather and air pollution are common problems facing the international community. Carbon dioxide emissions are the root causes of these environmental and climate issues. Due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, China has become the world's largest energy consumer and carbon dioxide emitter. Moreover, the manufacturing industry is highly energy-consuming and pollution-intensive, accounting for nearly 60% of China's total energy consumption and over 50% of total carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, identifying the main drivers of the industry's carbon dioxide emissions is vital for China's emission reduction and global efforts to enhance environmental protection. This study uses Vector Autoregressive model to analyze the influencing factors of the changes in carbon dioxide emissions in the industry. The results show that energy efficiency plays a dominant role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Urbanization also has significant effect on carbon dioxide emissions because of large-scale real estate construction and high rate of vehicle ownership. Energy structure has higher impact on emission reduction than industrialization due to massive coal consumption and industrial structure optimization. Therefore, the Chinese government should increase investment in energy-saving technology, optimize energy structure, promote the production and use of new energy and hybrid vehicles.

AB  - Identifying the key influencing factors of CO 2 emissions in China's iron and steel industry is vital for mitigating its emissions and formulating effective environmental protection measures. Most of the existing researches utilized time series data to investigate the driving factors of the industry's CO 2 emission at the national level, but regional differences have not been given appropriate attention. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2000 to 2013 and panel data models to examine the key driving forces of CO 2 emissions at the regional levels in China. The results show that industrialization dominates the industry's CO 2 emissions, but its effect varies across regions. The impact of energy efficiency on CO 2 emissions in the eastern region is greater than in the central and western regions because of a huge difference in R&D investment. The influence of urbanization has significant regional differences due to the heterogeneity in human capital accumulation and real estate development. Energy structure has large potential to mitigate CO 2 emissions on account of increased R&D investment in energy-saving technology and expanded clean energy use. Hence, in order to effectively achieve emission reduction, local governments should consider all these factors as well as regional heterogeneity in formulating appropriate mitigation policies.

AB  - Rising prices for natural gas, electricity, and other fuels have made it even harder for low-income families to pay their utility bills. By the end of fiscal year 2000, the Office of Community Services had awarded $30 million in Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH) program grants to 24 states and 12 tribal organizations to fund 54 separate projects to help meet the home energy (heating and cooling) needs of low-income households. These grants ranged from $50,000 to $1.6 million. Most of the 54 REACH projects have educated low-income clients about home energy efficiency through group workshops or on individual home visits. Many REACH projects have involved energy-related repairs to homes and budget counseling, and three state REACH projects are developing consumer cooperatives to purchase electricity or bulk fuels, such as heating oil. However, some REACH projects have included social services not directly related to meeting home energy needs. The legislation authorizing REACH identifies the following three performance goals for individual REACH projects,  (1) reduce the energy costs of participating households, (2) increase the regularity of home energy bill payments, and (3) increase energy suppliers' contributions to reduce eligible households' energy burden. Of the six project evaluations completed by states as of May 2001, only one project's design and implementation allowed statistically valid conclusions to be made about the effect of project services on participant energy use. The five other state project evaluations had analytical problems and other shortcomings that limited their usefulness in assessing project results. The Department of Health and Human Services has not yet developed a comprehensive plan for how it can best communicate summary information on best practices and lessons learned from the REACH program.

AB  - Abstract: Energy consumption in the residential sector offers an important opportunity for conserving resources. However, much of the current debate regarding energy efficiency in the housing market focuses on the physical and technical determinants of energy consumption, neglecting the role of the economic behavior of resident households. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which the use of gas and electricity is determined by the technical specifications of the dwelling as compared to the demographic characteristics of the residents. Our analysis is based on a sample of more than 300,000 Dutch homes and their occupants. The results indicate that residential gas consumption is determined principally by structural dwelling characteristics, such as the vintage, building type, and characteristics of the dwelling, while electricity consumption varies more directly with household composition, in particular income and family composition. Combining these results with projections on future economic and demographic trends, we find that, even absent price increases for residential energy, the aging of the population and their increasing wealth will roughly offset improvements in the energy efficiency of the building stock resulting from policy interventions and natural revitalization.

AB  - The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program with recent annual funding of about $2 billion that provides fuel payment assistance and payments for home energy efficiency improvements for low-income households. As energy prices continue to rise, this assistance is growing more important to mitigate the impact of higher prices on low-income households. HHS awards LIHEAP funds by formula to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, federally or state-recognized Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and territories. These grantees then provide energy assistance payments to low-income households. Within LIHEAP, the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH) program funds demonstration projects to help low-income families reduce their energy usage. GAO was asked to provide information on (1) HHS's oversight of LIHEAP payments made by grantees and (2) GAO's 2001 review of LIHEAP's REACH program. HHS relies on individual grantees--the states, tribal organizations, and territories--to oversee the LIHEAP program. Because the Single Audit Act made state and local governments primarily responsible for obtaining independent audits of funds they receive from federal programs, HHS's principal oversight function is to monitor, not audit, LIHEAP payments made by grantees. Monitoring includes assessing the quality of single audits conducted under the act, reviewing audit results, and ensuring that corrective actions are taken to resolve audit findings. GAO's brief review of relevant 2004 Single Audit Act reports showed that the only LIHEAP costs that were specifically questioned involved relatively small sums--for example, one report cited incorrect or duplicate payments totaling $8,864. Another audit report questioned $1,285 in LIHEAP payments because of inadequate procedures to prevent overpayments. GAO's 2001 review of the REACH program found several projects that included social services that were not directly related to meeting home energy needs. For example, six projects included job skill or employment development services, and one project provided funds to help clients pay past-due rent or mortgage payments. In addition, the report stated that REACH did not have performance goals that were objective and quantifiable. As a result, GAO did not believe HHS could effectively evaluate the program's overall performance. The report also noted that such goals would provide a clearer basis for selecting individual projects to fund. GAO recommended that HHS develop performance goals for REACH that were objective, measurable, and quantifiable. While HHS agreed with this recommendation, GAO has been unable to identify any actions taken to implement this recommendation. According to HHS, the agency continues to work on the development of long-term performance measures for LIHEAP. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper helps define responsible property investing (RPI) by using the Delphi Method to prioritize criteria for the evaluation of property investments. An international panel from the real estate and social investing sectors evaluated 66 criteria in terms of materiality to investors and importance to the public interest. A moderate to strong level of consensus was achieved. Criteria were ranked in terms of their materiality for financial performance and their importance to the public interest. Top ranked criteria were energy efficiency and conservation, high level of public transport services, transit-oriented development, daylight and natural ventilation, and contributes to higher density, mixed-use walkable places. There were few to no significant differences among the panellists by industry, gender or nationality. Factor analysis uncovered ten dimensions underlying the criteria. Based on this analysis, the panel would emphasize the creation of less automobile-dependent and more energy-efficient cities where worker well-being and urban revitalization are priorities. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating tools were compared with the results and found to be much stronger on environmental criteria than social concerns. The results can guide RPI portfolio audits, database development, third-party assessments of property companies, strategic consulting, the development of corporate reporting standards, RPI certification procedures, updated green building assessment tools, and cost-benefit studies to help guide asset managers...

AB  - The economic viability and investment cost of the energy retrofit of apartment buildings are analysed through different energy efficiency levels. To analyse retrofit policy cost-optimal energy efficiency levels and investment costs, a baseline of measured actual energy usage of apartment buildings was created and then individual energy-saving measures and retrofit packages were composed. The cost-optimal level over a 20-year period for apartment building retrofit was a low-energy-building energy performance level, with an investment cost of €150–170/m2. Retrofit to low energy building level would be economically viable but the investment capability of apartment owner associations is found to be insufficient for the necessary investments to achieve low-energy-building energy performance. Therefore, it is necessary to determine what levels of financial support can encourage retrofit to occur. The analysis of the current retrofit shows that subsides will increase investment by apartment owner associations into energy efficiency improvements. The target group for energy efficiency retrofit subsidies should be apartment buildings that reach low energy building performance level or at least match the energy performance requirement for new buildings.

According to the author, the comprehensive energy legislation of the Senate promotes a major expansion of renewable fuels and energy efficiency. However, the bill does not extend the energy-efficiency tax deduction for commercial buildings that the Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM) supports. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives extends the tax deduction for energy-efficient commercial building expenditures through 2013.

AB  - Imperfect information on future energy costs can lower the demand for more energy efficient technologies, with clear implications for energy supply, emissions and climate change. These hypotheses are explored using a randomised discrete choice experiment for property rental decisions. Results show that when energy consumption is expressed in physical units (as per the current EU labels) the willingness- to-pay for energy efficiency improvements is small and marginally significant. While bimonthly energy cost information displayed in monetary terms has no effect on the valuation of energy efficiency, annual monetary energy cost information led to a significant increase. This is the first paper to compare short and long-term point of sale energy cost information for household property decisions. There are clear implications for labelling policy for properties--framing energy consumption according to long-term monetary cost increases the demand for energy efficiency. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the paper, we investigate the role of smart building or green building innovations on the Polish real estate market using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method on the group of experts (consultants, managers, brokers) that are active on the office market in Krakow (study area). The findings point towards the highest relevance of the localisation factor, but also at the relatively low importance of the features of a sustainable building: building automation and information technology systems, as well as energy efficiency or certification. The findings suggest that despite the growing interest in sustainability and technological advancement amongst office market participants in Krakow, the relative importance of smart and green building features in their decision-making processes is relatively low. The study has some interesting practical implications. The knowledge regarding the relative importance of decision criteria can be valuable for developers and investors because the anticipation of tenants' expectations is directly linked with return on investment and innovation premiums.

AB  - This study uses a general equilibrium model to compare environmental and economic outcomes of two policies: (1) a tax credit of 10 percent of the price of household capital that is 20 percent more energy efficient than its unsubsidized counterpart, assuming half of new household investment qualifies for the credit; and (2) a tax starting at $30 ($2007) per metric ton of CO2 rising five percent annually. By 2040, the carbon tax and tax credit reduce emissions by about 60 1.5 percent, respectively. Assuming other countries impose no carbon price, we find that although the carbon tax reduces U.S. GDP, it improves US. household welfare because it reduces world fuel prices, strengthens US. terms of trade, and makes imports cheaper The revenue neutral tax credit reduces welfare but boosts U.S. GDP growth slightly a(first. Both policies have similar impacts on the federal budget, but of opposite signs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Attention to ‘sustainability’ and energy efficiency rating schemes in the commercial property sector has increased rapidly during the past decade. In the UK, commercial properties have been certified under the BREEAM rating scheme since 1999, offering fertile ground to investigate the economic dynamics of ‘green’ certification in the commercial property market. This paper documents that, over the 2000–09 period, the expanding supply of green buildings within a given London neighbourhood had a positive impact on average rents and prices, but reduced rents and prices for environmentally certified real estate. The results suggest that there is a gentrification effect from green buildings. However, each additional “green” building decreases the marginal effect of certification in the rental and transaction markets by 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. In addition, controlling for lease contract features, like contract length and the rent-free period, modifies the impact of environmental certification on rental prices. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

N2  - We estimate that the recent surge in international fossil fuel prices will raise European households' cost of living in 2022 by close to 7 percent of consumption on average. Household burdens vary significantly across and within countries, but in most cases they are regressive. Policymakers have mostly responded to the shock with broad-based price-suppressing measures, including subsidies, tax reductions, and price controls. Going forward, the policy emphasis should shift rapidly towards allowing price signals to operate more freely and providing income relief to the vulnerable. The surge in energy prices will encourage energy conservation and investments in renewable energy, but the manyfold rise in natural gas prices could lead to a persistent switch towards coal. To ensure steady progress towards carbon emissions reduction goals, authorities could use the opportunity to strengthen carbon pricing when global fossil fuel prices decline in the future. Non-price incentives for investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy should also be enhanced, as envisaged in the RePowerEU plan.

N2  - The aim of this article is to introduce for the first time the topic of 'stranded assets' into research involving the built environment. It focuses on the idea that climate change policy could induce the stranding of some conventional property assets in the global real estate market. Principally, the empirical focus for study is the UK interaction with energy performance certificates and minimum energy performance standards. However, comparisons are made internationally, and key distinctions are made between developed and less developed countries. The article observes that stranded assets are not new in real estate; the changing consumer demand of occupiers has regularly rendered property assets redundant or obsolete. However, what is new is the influence of climate change and associated environmental policy on some property assets. The article deliberately combines conceptual agendas often studied in isolation. Theories of path dependence and lock-in are used to understand the problematic traction of climate change legislation within traditional real estate institutions. The implications of this situation, the potentially hidden systemic socio-economic reach of stranded assets, is then considered through the lens of contemporary debates of financialisation. Socio-technical system theory, as it relates to contemporary energy policy regimes, is then examined to connect persistent lock-in with financialised global investment markets. The article then posits how associated legislation could be used to capture a global picture of stranded assets in real estate. Revealing the stranded asset exposure should be a concern to real estate investors and those charged with managing such assets. However, more optimistically this potential risk may provide the catalyst for energy efficient transition in the built environment. The article concludes by outlining an interdisciplinary research agenda for stranded assets in global real estate.

N2  - This paper analyzes the tax incentives and aids adopted in the taxes and environmental policies to improve the energy efficiency of Spanish households. The established environmental policy presents advances although with incipient results, since the energy efficiency of the houses still plays a secondary role. In the area of taxes, no tax incentives have been effective in reducing the investment in improvements in the energy efficiency of homes, especially in those of old construction. Our conclusions indicate the convenience of promoting the energy efficiency of homes through the fiscal route. In this sense, it proposes incorporating an incentive to the Personal Income Tax linked to improved energy rating of housing. Also, it raises the improvements in the current regulations on tax benefits on the Real Estate Tax and on the Tax on Building, Installations and Infrastructural Work. These are two of the main features of this paper.

N2  - Improving the energy efficiency levels of the housing stock is of particular concern in the private rental market where capital costs and utility cost savings are not shared in equal measure by landlords and tenants. This problem is particularly pronounced in the German housing market with its predominance of rented accommodation over owner occupancy. The present study is the largest to date to investigate the effect of energy efficiency ratings on rental values. Using a semiparametric hedonic model and an empirical sample of nearly 760 thousand observations across 403 local markets in Germany with full hedonic characteristics, we find evidence that energy-efficient rental units are rented at a premium. However, this effect is not confirmed for the largest metropolitan housing markets. In a second step, a survival hazard model is estimated to study the impact of the energy ratings on time-on-market. It is found that energy inefficient dwelling have longer marketing periods and are hence less liquid than their more energy efficient counterparts.

N2  - I analyze energy-efficiency policy as a prescription of a minimum-efficiency standard for energy-using household goods like cars, building insulation, and home appliances. Such a policy has two effects. At the intensive margin, a household that invests will choose a more efficient device. At the extensive margin, there will be more households that choose not to invest at all. Thus, additional to and different from rebound effects, energy-efficiency policy may have unintended consequences. I analyze the equilibrium effects of a minimum-efficiency standard, taking price adjustments and household heterogeneity into account. A moderate minimum-efficiency standard increases demand for efficiency-enhancing household capital goods, and reduces energy demand. More stringent policy is shown to be less effective or even counterproductive. For the case of a fixed supply of efficiency-enhancing capital, it is shown that minimum-efficiency standards increase equilibrium energy demand. Finally, I analyze which households benefit from minimum-efficiency standards and which ones lose. A standard induces investing households to expend more for household capital and less for energy. The wedge between the induced expenditures and the private optimum is analyzed as a deadweight loss.

N2  - This paper investigates how private consumers capitalize energy efficiency in the housing market, and the extent to which the provision of an energy performance certificate (EPC) affects such capitalization. We explicitly address methodological lacunae in the literature, using an exhaustive battery of identification strategies. The results indicate that energy efficiency is indeed capitalized into home prices, with OLS estimates biased downwards. Using an IV approach, we find that as the level of energy efficiency increases by ten percent, the market value of the dwelling increases by around 2.2 percent--quite a precise reflection of both the required capital outlay and future energy savings. These results are confirmed in a repeat-sales analysis. Importantly, examining the role of energy performance certificates (EPCs), we document that the extent of capitalization of energy efficiency is not affected by information provision, questioning the continued need for government-imposed certification programs.

AB  - The residential sector accounts for 33% of electricity consumption in the U.S., with a total expenditure of $166 billion in 2010. Increasing the energy efficiency of the durable housing stock can thus provide significant cost savings for consumers. One promising trend is the rise of homes labeled by a third party as “green” or energy efficient. This paper documents evidence on the effects of providing information about the energy efficiency and “sustainability” of structures in affecting consumer choice. We conduct a hedonic pricing analysis of all single-family home sales in California over the time period 2007 to 2012, and find that homes labeled with a green label transact at a small premium relative to otherwise comparable, non-labeled homes. We show evidence of spatial variation in this capitalization such that both environmental ideology and local climatic conditions play a role in explaining the variation in the green premium across geographies.

N2  - Key obstacles to achieving the ambitious decarbonization targets determined in the Paris Agreement include the poor energy efficiency of the European commercial real estate sector and excessively low refurbishments rates due to uncertainty and a lack of transparency regarding future regulatory guidelines. This paper introduces the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM), aimed at accelerating decarbonization and climate change resilience by clearly communicating the downside financial risks associated with poor energy performance buildings, and quantifying the market implications of climate change on the building stock. Science-based emission targets serve as a theoretical foundation for providing the industry with appropriate carbon reduction pathways for particular buildings at the portfolio and company levels. A key outcome of this project is a quantitative and qualitative financial risk assessment tool. The aim is to optimize industry investments in energy-efficient retrofits by making risks more transparent and by revealing opportunities for property owners and investors. The CRREM tool enables the industry to assess stranding risks, accelerating the decarbonization of the EU building stock to "2-degree readiness" (2DR) and make real estate portfolios "future proof."

AB  - The European Union has relied upon information symmetry theory to foster decarbonization of existing buildings in cities under the hypothesis that efficient buildings receive a market premium. Hedonic analysis of housing prices across European cities suggests the existence of such a premium; while opinion-based research concludes that households pay scarce attention to energy performance when letting or buying a home. These approaches render inconclusive evidence regarding the role of energy-information symmetry as public policy in climate change mitigation through market prices. Since energy-efficiency attributes are contingent on the architectural quality of homes, poor control of the latter in hedonic models may bring biased conclusions regarding the former. The main contribution of this piece is to improve the control of these non-energy attributes using a visual inspection of listed apartments in Madrid and Barcelona. Results suggest that the energy-efficiency price premium completely disappears when other quality attributes are considered in full. This finding has large implications for energy and city policies. • Energy performance impact on housing prices fades out when controlling for architectural quality in Madrid and Barcelona. • Insufficient control of architectural quality may inflate the marginal price of energy efficiency in hedonic models. • Omitting the relationship between energy performance and homes' quality attributes may inflate hedonic agenda's results. • Administrative data sets used in hedonic models may be complemented by self-assessed quality attributes. • In Spain, the EPC scheme seems to fail in providing price differentiation in the residential market.

AB  - Abstract This paper examines the biggest house energy efficiency retrofit support program in Greece which ran during 2011–2015 and approximately fifty thousand households participated. We take advantage of an exogenous policy change resulting in cost reduction for households that occurred while the program was running. This change substantially increased the subsidy rate for lower-income households. We find that this effective cost reduction increased the participation rate (extensive margin). We add to the literature on retrofits by further showing that this change increased substantially the investment amount (intensive margin) of these lower-income households. Detailed data on a sub-sample of households reveal that this increase was driven primarily by window replacement and thermal insulation investments. Highlights • We examine the largest house energy efficiency retrofit support program in Greece. • We provide causal evidence for lower-income households' investment behavior. • Subsidy change increased participation by lower-income households increased. • Lower-income households also increased their investment intensity. • The increase was due to investments in window replacement and thermal insulation.

AB  - The substantial subsidizing of energy prices over the years has led to high energy consumption, inefficiencies, fiscal pressures, and environmental problems in Iran. To address the increasing socio-economic problems associated with the energy subsidies, the government embarked on an aggressive energy price reform through which energy subsidies were removed and cash handouts were given to all households in 2010. In this paper, I analyze the effectiveness of the energy price reform in Iran by estimating energy demand elasticities for households in different income groups. I apply a two-stage consumer optimization model and estimate the system of energy expenditures shares using the household budget survey data for the period 2001–2008. The results show that the overall price elasticities of demand are small, but income elasticities are close to one. The results also indicate heterogeneous responses to energy price and income changes in different income groups. Specifically, the urban households show stronger response to price changes, but rural households, particularly mid-income households, to income changes. These findings suggest that the current policy of price increases would not solely be able to reduce energy consumption and, therefore, it should be geared towards increasing energy efficiency through a series of price and non-price measures.

AB  - We revisit the issue of the energy efficiency (EE) gap by explicitly acknowledging the two-sided nature of the rental housing market and two-sided asymmetries of information between tenants and landlords. Employing a theoretical matching model, we show that Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) that signal a dwelling's energy performance induce optimal EE investments by landlords only if tenants pay their energy expenditures in full. When landlords pay part of the energy expenditures, they seek tenants who will conserve energy. Our model shows that asymmetry of information over tenant characteristics results in suboptimally low investments in EE. This may even render EPCs counterproductive. As a remedy, we show that tenant-side signaling needs to be rolled out jointly with EPCs and may even be sufficient when contracts include energy expenditures. Data from an original survey provides support for these insights and suggests that information on the tenants' side contributes to more EE investment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose On the basis of corporate wholesale and hypermarket stores, this study aims to investigate the relationship between energy consumption, physical building characteristics and operational sales performance and the impact of energy management on the corporate environmental performance.Design/methodology/approach A very unique dataset of METRO GROUP over 19 European countries is analyzed in a sophisticated econometric approach for the timeframe from January 2011 until December 2014. Multiple regression models are applied for the panel, to explain the electricity consumption of the corporate assets on a monthly basis and the total energy consumption on an annual basis. Using Generalized Additive Models, to model nonlinear covariate effects, the authors decompose the response variables into the implicit contribution of building characteristics, operational sales performance and energy management attributes, under control of the outdoor weather conditions and spatial–temporal effects.Findings METRO GROUP’s wholesale and hypermarket stores prove significant reductions in electricity and total energy consumption over the analyzed timeframe. Due to the implemented energy consumption and carbon emission reduction targets, the influence of the energy management measures, such as the identification of stores associated with the lowest energy performance, was found to contribute toward a more efficient corporate environmental performance.Originality/value In the context of corporate responsibility/sustainability of wholesale, hypermarket and retail corporations, the energy efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions from corporates’ real estate assets is of emerging interest. Besides the insights about the energy efficiency of corporate real estate assets, the role of the energy management, contributing to a more efficient corporate environmental performance, is not yet investigated for a large European wholesale and hypermarket portfolio.

N2  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to suggest that property investors should engage with governments to influence outcomes. Global collaboration is required from the real estate investment community, working closely with governments and legislators, to provide a clear road map to zero carbon emissions. COVID-19 has shown how quickly governments around the world can react with draconian responses, including widespread lockdowns, when faced with an existential threat. What bigger existential threat is there than climate change? Design/methodology/approach: Personal viewpoint from general research. Findings: Three pillars of likely government and legislative interventions are identified; namely, increased and enhanced energy regulation and carbon pricing to force a rapid switch to green energy sources for buildings; an enhanced role for Energy Performance Certificates, standardised methodologies and strict enforcement; and mandatory reporting of financial and physical climate risks based on the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. It is suggested that property investors should now engage with governments to influence outcomes.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to find out the green preferences of corporate occupiers in relation to their occupied offices. The study aims to focus on the preferences of the end-users at the organisational level. It also aims to study the relative importance of these preferences against one another and to seek the differences between respondent groups. Design/methodology/approach – The survey is a case study approach concentrating on the situation in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Finland) in the summer of 2009. The survey was conducted as an internet-based questionnaire with e-mail invitations. The importance of nine given green attributes of the office buildings were ranked on a five-point Likert scale. A total of 90 responses were analysed. Findings – The results show that location achieved the highest importance, even though it was rated in terms of the environmental sense only. The energy efficiency of a building was ranked second. The indicative results suggest that industry sector and the position of the respondent effect the importance of the preferences. Research limitations/implications – The Helsinki Metropolitan Area was the focus of the study, but it is believed that the results can be generalised to other office market areas in Finland. Practical implications – The findings will benefit the management of occupying organisations, real estate investors and marketers who may now deepen their understanding of the preferences of corporate occupiers. The results may be useful to organisations promoting green buildings. Originality/value – The mainstream sustainability research in the real estate sector has focused on green buildings in the area of new construction, and economical and technical approaches. This study concentrates on end-users' considerations at the organisational level and green preferences in the existing office stock. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Energy consumption in the commercial property sector offers an important opportunity for conserving resources. In this study, we evaluate the financial implications of two elements of “sustainability” – energy efficiency and accessibility – in the market for commercial real estate. An empirical analysis of some 1100 leasing transactions in the Netherlands over the 2005–2010 period shows that buildings designated as inefficient (with an EU energy performance certificate D or worse) command rental levels that are some 6.5 percent lower as compared to energy efficient, but otherwise similar buildings (labeled A, B or C). Furthermore, this study shows that office buildings in multi-functional areas, with access to public transport and facilities, achieve rental premiums over mono-functional office districts. For policymakers, the results documented in this paper provide an indication on the effectiveness of the EU energy performance certificate as a market signal in the commercial property sector. The findings documented here are also relevant for investors in European office markets, as the importance of energy efficiency and locational diversification is bound to increase following stricter environmental regulation and changing tenant preferences.

N2  - The recent dispositions related to the energy performance of buildings, launched by the European Directives 2002/91/EC and 2010/31/EU, turned attention to the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). The aim of this study is to investigate the economic effects of the recent Italian statutory provisions related to energy performance of buildings on listing behaviour. With this aim an hedonic regression analysis is performed, in order to measure the impact of EPC level on listing prices. The study, based on a set of more than 500 housing property asset collected in 2012 from real estate advertisements websites, is focused on the Turin real estate market as a case study. Furthermore this paper contributes to the early limited literature on implication of the impact of EPC level on Italian housing market, representing one of the first systematic evidence about the energy certifications in the housing listing prices.

N2  - Location is, along with other aspects, one of the most important characteristics when determining the sale or rental price of a residential property. Energy rating is one of the characteristics involved in determining the rent or sale price of a house. Past research has shown the importance of this attribute in numerous studies. Moreover, these studies have found mixed results regarding the magnitude, direction, and statistical significance of energy rating price premiums. This research aims to determine whether housing location influences energy rating price premium. To achieve this objective, a least squares regression model and a multilevel model were estimated using a sample of 70,170 different residences that were offered for sale in the province of Alicante. The multilevel models show that, once the differences due to the location (comarca) had been eliminated, the energy rating label itself had an effect on the asking price and also that there was an effect for the relationship of the energy rating with the location characteristics (comarca). On the other hand, the variables that defined the energy ratings were not those responsible for the differences between the average asking prices of the residences in the comarcas.

AB  - Concerns about global warming and growing scarcity of fossil fuels require substantial changes in energy consumption patterns and energy systems, as targeted by many countries around the world. One key element to achieve such transformation is to increase energy efficiency of the housing stock. In this context, it is frequently argued that private investments are too low in the light of the potential energy cost savings. However, heterogeneous incentives to invest in energy efficiency, especially for owner-occupants and landlords, may serve as one explanation. This is particularly important for countries with a large rental sector, like Germany. Nevertheless, previous literature largely focuses on the payoffs owner-occupants receive, leaving out the rental market. This paper addresses this gap by comparing the capitalisation of energy efficiency in selling prices and rents, for both types of residences. For this purpose data from the Berlin housing market are analysed using hedonic regressions. The estimations reveal that energy efficiency is well capitalised in apartment prices and rents. The comparison of implicit prices and the net present value of energy cost savings/rents reveals that investors anticipate future energy and house price movements reasonably. However, in the rental segment, the value of future energy cost savings exceeds tenants' implicit willingness to pay by a factor of 2.5. This can either be interpreted as a result of market power of tenants, uncertainty in the rental relationship or the 'landlord-tenant dilemma'. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - 对全球变暖和化石燃料日益稀缺的担忧要求能源消费模式和能源体系作出实质性的改变，这是 全球许多国家的目标。实现这种转型的一个关键要素是提高存量住房的能效。在这一背景下， 人们经常指出，鉴于潜在的能源成本节约，私人投资力度太低了。但是，能效投资的动机不一， 尤其是自住业主和房东的动机很不一样，这可作为一种解释。这一点对于德国这样租房业庞大 的国家而言尤其重要。不过，先前的研宄文献大多重点关注自住业主获得的回报而忽略了租房 市场。本文通过比较两类住房的能效在售价和租金上的资本化结果，填补了这一空白。为此， 我们收集了柏林住房市场的数据，并用特征回归法做了分析。估算表明，能效能很好地转化为 公寓售价和租金。隐在价格与能源成本节约/租金净现价的比较表明，投资者合理预期了未来能 源价格和房屋价格的变动。但是，在租房领域，未来能源成本节约所带来的价值超出了租户买 单的潜在意愿，超出系数为2.5。这可通过租户的市场力量、租赁关系的不确定性或“房东-租 户困境”来解释。 (Chinese) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - Reducing energy consumption in the building sector is a priority issue in European policy. The aim of legislation on energy certification is to provide incentives for the energy renovation of buildings. To help achieve this goal, a methodology is proposed to provide information on the economic cost of the energy bill, in addition to the current indicators of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. By applying this methodology, it can be seen that energy costs account for between 5% and 62% of the price of renting a house in Spain. Making this information available to the consumers would have a direct impact on rental prices. The landlords/landladies who carry out the energy renovation of their home could charge a higher rent, which would allow them to recover the investment made. Also, tenants of homes with more expensive energy bills would benefit from having their rent reduced. Landlords/landladies who renovate their home and tenants who access a home without energy renovation would benefit from making energy costs visible. This simple legislative measure would help to overcome the added difficulty that owners of rental homes have--they pay for the energy renovation while the tenants enjoy the savings after the improvement of the property. With a minimum of additional effort, a significant impact on an important issue could be achieved.

AB  - Abstract: In recent years, formal certification programs for rating and evaluating the sustainability and energy efficiency of buildings have proliferated around the world. Developers recognize that such “green labels” differentiate products and allow them to charge a price premium. China has not formally adopted such rating standards. In the absence of such standards, developers are competing with each other based on their own self-reported indicators of their buildings’ “greenness”. We create an index using Google search to rank housing complexes in Beijing with respect to their “marketing greenness” and document that these “green” units sell for a price premium at the presale stage but they subsequently resell or rent for a price discount. An introduction of a standardized official certification program would help “green” demanders to acquire units that they desire and would accelerate the advance of China’s nascent green real estate market.

He asserts that the packs have seen as an extra expense to the real estate agents in the overall fee structure. However, the Energy Performance Certificates has offered sufficient knowledge and understanding of the property market to the consumers.

AB  - Numerous countries have introduced energy performance certificates to mitigate the information asymmetry with respect to the thermal quality of houses. Motivated by a stylized theoretical model and drawing on comprehensive data on real estate advertisements in the German housing market, this paper investigates the causal effect of disclosing energy information on the asking prices of houses. Employing within-variation from panel data, augmented by an instrumental variable approach to isolate effects among policy compliers, our analysis demonstrates the power of mandatory disclosure rules to increase market transparency and to align prices with the energy performance of the house. Among our key results, we find that house owners reduce offer prices in response to the disclosure of energy efficiency information. Furthermore, this effect is particularly pronounced for owners who would not disclose in the absence of the mandatory disclosure policy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Once Web 2.0 luddites, more and more utilities are now adopting social media. Whether it's a company profile and job postings on LinkedIn, a Facebook page with tips about energy efficiency, or a Twitter stream disseminating information about recent outages, utilities are undeniably serious about adding digital real estate to their service territory. Yet even as the utility march towards Web 2.0 gathers momentum, the heavily regulated nature of the utility industry presents challenges in the naturally free-flowing world of social media. In addition to the traditional issues that all businesses face when engaging social media - from workplace concerns related to employee abuses of social media and appropriate discipline to copyright and IP protection - utilities must also ensure that their participation in social media does not run afoul of affiliate codes of conduct, SEC regulation, and a host of other compliance issues. This article provides an exhaustive summary of the legal and regulatory issues potentially implicated by utility engagement in social media, and proposes best practices and guidelines for development of a social media policy that reduce the risks of social media for utilities.

N2  - The housing sector is a substantial consumer of energy, and therefore a focus for energy savings efforts. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), introduced in 2002 and revised in 2010, is a key instrument to increase the energy performance of buildings across the European Union. Following the implementation of the EPBD into Spanish law, all properties offered for sale or rented out in Spain are required to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). Given that the implementation of the EPC scheme for new, existing and advertised properties is still very low in Spain, unlike other European housing markets, the Spanish one lacks market data on energy efficiency (EE) labels and their impact on housing price. To overcome this gap, we determine the EE ratings of a sample of 1507 homes across Spain on the basis of information collected previously through household surveys. This allowed us to answer the question of whether or not, and to what extent, Spanish housing markets capitalise the value of EE. We apply the hedonic-price technique and observe that more energy efficient dwellings have a price-premium between 5.4% and 9.8% compared to those with the same characteristics but lower EE level.

AB  - The Chinese central government introduced the 'Chinese Green Building Label' in 2008, which makes China one of the few developing countries with an official rating system of buildings' performance in sustainability. This paper investigates the existence and magnitude of the price premium associated with this official green label in the residential sector. Based on a unique data set of green-labelled, newly built housing projects and their non-labelled counterparts from around the country in 2013, an empirical analysis suggests that the labelled housing projects attract a price premium of 6.9% compared with their non-labelled counterparts. Further analysis suggests that this official green label is more effective as a reliable signal of buildings' energy efficiency in the Chinese context compared with developers' self-advertised 'greenness'. These results provide preliminary evidence that with this official rating system, the investment in buildings' energy-efficiency could be potentially profitable for housing developers in China, and such profitability may herald a rapid development of the green housing market in urban China.

AB  - Worldwide, policy makers have on top of their agendas to mitigate climate emergency. Green buildings are no longer a niche market, being increasingly adopted due to their enlarged benefits, in both environmental and economic terms. Sustainable and ecofriendly architecture is the natural path for the housing sector to achieve balance and contribute to the overall sustainable development. For this reason, moving towards greener buildings must be immediate in a world relying upon scant earth extracted resources. Sustainable buildings produce environmental, social and economic benefits, as such, their patterns should be the norm instead of the exception. Shifting towards greener buildings is attractive to all players in the innovation ecosystem; as, these properties generate value for their owners, their users, and to the entire society. Indeed, several rating systems exist to assess the environmental performance of real estate, ranking their sustainability performance in terms of energy consumption. Energy performance certificates are among the most popular in Portugal. These certificates identify the property energy efficiency highlighting the strengths and the weaknesses in each component. Among the UE countries, EPCs were introduced by the Directive (2010/31/EU) in 2010, albeit with heterogeneous paces and slightly singular details in each member states. Being for consequence the core EU policy instrument to improve energetic performance of buildings to reach energetic sustainability. The empirical analysis relies on the evolution of the Portuguese certificate emissions in the time frame of 2014-2020 at the municipality level, proving that the greener transition in buildings has been asymmetrically addressed in the geography, further highlighting the asymmetries between seaside and countryside, and also big and small cities. Planning and building cities, disregarding their size, is critical for developing competitive and livable cities in which one may find energetic justice due to the smart use of energy sources allowing the entire community to access modern standards of living. However, this analysis has not been made so far, being neglected in extant literature. In doing so, we aim to shed light on the efficacy of the policy instrument as a seed of sustainable practices, but also on the promotion of territorial cohesion, which is a particularly hard problem to tackle by policy makers given the demographic and economic challenges of the present.

N2  - In order to foster energy-informed real estate decisions, the EU has universalised the energy performance certificates to be displayed on advertising for sale and rental. However, in Spain, such certificates are absent in a disturbing proportion of cases. This paper investigates the prevalence of this problem, its spatial patterns, and the concomitant architectonic and locative attributes. In doing so, data from 49,000 apartments listed for leasing and renting in Metropolitan Barcelona are analysed using conventional and spatial econometric methods. The results suggest that the probability that a listing includes the energy rating of the dwelling largely depends on other neighbouring listings. Furthermore, the information opacity exists for the worst dwellings, which are expected to be the most inefficient, located in areas inhabited by low-income population. That is, the population that could benefit the most from this policy is, precisely, the most uninformed.

N2  - Purpose: This paper aims to decompose the value effects of green retrofits on commercial real estate. The paper disentangles various sources of value capture mechanisms that can be attained through green retrofit actions and profiles the extent to which green retrofit solutions can be effectively capitalised using transaction evidence from the Munich housing market. The insights offered can help real estate owners and investors during their ex ante analysis of future energetic retrofit investments. Design/methodology/approach: The authors offer their reader both a conceptual framework and the results from an empirical analysis to identify the value effects of retrofits and the associating gains in energy efficiency. The conceptual framework theorises the different value components that a deep retrofit has to offer. The regression analysis includes a multivariate analysis of 8,928 dwellings in the Munich residential real estate market. Findings: This study's framework disentangles the total retrofit value effect into three components: the capitalisation of energy savings, the exposure to the value discount because of stricter standards and the value uplift because of indirect benefits (health, employee satisfaction, marketing etc.). The regression results indicate that the value gains because of energy efficiency improvements are in the range of 2.4-7.4%, while the indirect benefits and reduced exposure to stricter standards amount to another 3%.

N2  - The German Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires sellers on the housing market to provide detailed information on expected yearly energy consumption per square meter (energy performance, EPS). This paper uses variation in local fuel prices and climate, fuel types, and building ages to analyse the relationship between expected energy cost savings from energy efficient building structure and house prices in a data set of listing prices from all regions of Germany. Results suggest that heating cost considerations are less relevant than previously thought.

N2  - Energy efficiency ratings of residential buildings are intended to remove assessment errors from real estate markets to increase energy efficiency--the key to fully decarbonizing the building sector. Price premiums of rated buildings should reflect capitalized future energy savings, but instead are nonlinear (1), can exceed savings (2) and are correlated with buyer's characteristics (3). We explore these anomalies with a hedonic model of product differentiation, which is adapted to efficiency valuation in the housing market. The model implies that buyers with high willingness to pay for efficiency "sort" themselves to efficient buildings (and vice versa) and drive their premiums above average discounted energy expenditures--if the market share of the efficient buildings is below average. In this sense a non-linear scarcity premium explains findings (1) and (2). Furthermore, it is revealed that the results from (3) require average buyer's characteristics to vary spatially, but neither their variance nor the variance of buildings stocks efficiency--strong assumptions. The model explains measured premiums of the UK well and shows that as well as buyer heterogeneity and supply structure, the prebound effect--the overestimation of energy costs in inefficient buildings by ratings--also plays an important role in determining efficiency premiums.

N2  - The residential sector is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions. Improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock can reduce carbon emissions and increase property values. In this paper, we examine whether residential energy efficiency improvements are capitalized into home prices in Anchorage, Alaska. The impact of a residential energy efficiency program on single-family house prices is estimated using both a hedonic pricing framework and a difference-in-differences estimator. The results indicate that participating homes sell for a premium of 4.2% compared to similar properties that did not participate in the program.

AB  - Abstract Residents of Interior Alaska are faced with a cold climate and relatively high energy prices, which results in high home energy expenditures. Increasing the energy efficiency of the housing stock can help reduce household energy expenditures. Following a spike in oil prices in 2008, legislation was passed, which created the Home Energy Rebate Program. Homeowners participating in the program were eligible to receive up to a $10,000 rebate for preapproved home energy efficiency improvements. This paper examines the effect of the Home Energy Rebate program on the selling prices of single-family residences in the Fairbanks North Star Borough from 2008 through 2015 using a hedonic pricing analysis. The results show that homes that completed the Home Energy Rebate program in the Fairbanks North Star Borough sell for a 15.1–16.5% price premium over similar homes that did not complete the program, which indicates that investments in residential energy efficiency are compensated. This is the first study to examine the impact of energy efficiency on house prices in a market with a subarctic climate. Highlights • We estimate the value of EE in a subarctic housing market. • The effect of an energy efficiency (EE) program on property prices is estimated. • The homes of program participants sell at a premium between 15.1% and 16.5%. • Investments in EE are compensated in the Fairbanks housing market.

N2  - The important role of the buildings energy issue, recognized by the current international policies, is confirmed by the strategies employed in different European countries to promote energy efficiency measures. With reference to two samples of residential properties recently sold in the two Italian cities of Bari (Southern Italy) and Bolzano (Northern Italy), located in different areas in terms of the socio-economic and climatic factors, in the present research an econometric analysis to verify the contribution of the energy performance on the residential selling prices is implemented. The proposed methodology and the results obtained constitute a useful support for both the Public Institutions, interested in testing the effectiveness of the energy policies already activated and planning the future incentives, and the private operators, who can appropriately perform their investment decisions by taking into account the increase in the market values expected by the energy retrofit initiatives.

N2  - In the context of curbing greenhouse gas emissions to meet the ambitious but much-needed targets to limit global warming to reasonable levels, residential housing can play a significant role. By enhancing the energy efficiency of residential housing, emission reductions, reduced costs and better health and wellbeing of occupants may be achieved. Despite gradual improvements in home energy efficiency, homeowner engagement could be greatly enhanced by the demonstration of how energy efficiency and energy ratings can be reflected in residential property values. Ascertaining the value of energy efficiency may enable greater investment and potential for increased availability of finance for added energy efficiency options in new and existing housing. Extant research suggests a significant relationship between house values, rental prices and energy efficiency certifications, particularly where mandatory disclosure operates. However, limited research has examined residential valuers' (appraisers) perspectives and practice considerations. This paper examines the challenges for valuers in identifying and considering energy efficiency initiatives and ratings on residential property value and the capacity of residential valuation professionals to incorporate energy efficiency into the valuation (appraisal) process. The research identified limited means available to valuers in Australia in identifying energy efficiency attributes and ratings; challenges in awareness, knowledge, and understanding of energy efficiency ratings; and, subsequently, limitations in consideration of initiatives and ratings in valuation. This research affirms findings of other Australian and international studies, suggesting mandatory disclosure and certification are essential if energy efficiency is to be considered by the market and reflected in residential valuation.

AB  - This study empirically estimated disaggregate market transaction costs facing single-family house-owners when energy renovating their dwelling. Two types of energy renovations are analysed: heat insulation and energy-saving windows. An analytical framework was developed including an adjustment mechanism for time-biases displayed by households. The decision process was modelling in three steps where households can be either latent, potential or actual clients to an energy renovation project. Data was collected by web-based surveys. The transaction costs are estimated based on time assessment, income levels and monetary expenditures occurring in the decision process. The results suggest that the magnitude of the transaction costs can be an important barrier to energy renovations. For energy-saving windows, transaction costs can constitute more than 50% of the investment cost, and almost 24% for heat insulation. The largest potential reduction in the transaction costs is found in the implementation phase. • Time-adjusted transaction costs for single-family home-owners are estimated. • Data is collected using a unique survey. • Transaction costs corresponds to ∼50% of the investment cost for energy-saving windows. • Transaction costs corresponds to ∼24% of the investment cost for heat insulation. • Transaction costs are a major barrier for energy efficiency investments. • Policies should be focused in reducing uncertainties and issues related to the implementation phase.

N2  - This research explores the time-to-sell (TTS) of green real estate. We employ data on primary market transactions in six newly developed multi-story condominiums--of which three are green and three are conventionally built--located in a single neighborhood of Netanya, Israel. We find that, after addressing the potential endogeneity between unit TTS and price, the average TTS of units in green, as compared to conventional, structures is significantly shorter. Considering developers' financing cost, this shorter TTS is equivalent to an indirect price premium of 1%-5%. We also find that whenever the indirect green premium associated with TTS decreases, the green quality-adjusted price premium increases. Thus, considering both price and TTS, we estimate a total green price premium of about 5%.

AB  - The Brazilian Federal Government has been recently promoting energy-conservation initiatives, most notably the 'Thermal Performance in Buildings - Brazilian Bioclimatic Zones and Building Guidelines for Low-Cost Housing' and the 'Federal Regulation for Voluntary Labelling of Energy Efficiency Levels in Commercial, Public and Service Buildings'. These new regulations provide information for designers based on Brazil's climate requirements, with specific advice related to lighting systems, HVAC and the thermal envelope of buildings. Nevertheless, requirements for naturally ventilated indoor environments appear as an open category without clear criteria. To address this, the paper proposes guidelines for naturally ventilated environments in which specific thermal and air movement acceptability goals must be achieved. The guidelines are based on results from field experiments in non-residential naturally ventilated buildings in different climatic zones as well as drawing on other studies. The proposed guidelines consider occupants' adaptive potential as well as thermal and air movement acceptability. Combining thermal acceptability with air movement acceptability is a key design challenge. Permissible operative temperature ranges are based on the ASHRAE 55 adaptive comfort standard, and minimum air velocity requirements within the occupied zone are specified. Considerations also included 'active' occupants and specific control over openings and fans. Le Gouvernement federal bresilien encourage depuis peu les initiatives en faveur des economies d'energie, et tout particulierement les initiatives « Performances Thermiques des Immeubles - Zones Bioclimatiques Bresiliennes et Directives de Construction pour les Logements a Faible Cout » et « Reglementation Federale pour l'Etiquetage Volontaire des Niveaux de Rendement Energetique des Immeubles Commerciaux, Publics et de Services ». Ces reglementations nouvelles fournissent aux concepteurs des informations basees sur les exigences climatiques du Bresil, et s'accompagnent de conseils specifiques relatifs aux systemes d'eclairage, aux systemes CVCA et a l'enveloppe thermique des immeubles. Neanmoins, les exigences relatives aux environnements interieurs a ventilation naturelle apparaissent comme une categorie ouverte sans criteres clairs. Pour traiter ce probleme, le present article propose des directives pour les environnements a ventilation naturelle dans lesquels des objectifs specifiques d'acceptabilite thermique et en matiere de circulation d'air doivent etre atteints. Ces directives sont basees sur les resultats d'experiences de terrain menees dans des immeubles non residentiels a ventilation naturelle dans differentes zones climatiques, mais s'appuient egalement sur d'autres etudes. Les directives proposees prennent en consideration le potentiel adaptatif des occupants aussi bien que l'acceptabilite thermique et en matiere de circulation d'air. Reussir a combiner l'acceptabilite thermique et l'acceptabilite en matiere de circulation d'air pose un probleme de conception essentiel. Les plages de temperature de service admissibles sont basees sur la norme de confort adaptatif ASHRAE 55, et les exigences minimales quant a la vitesse de l'air dans la zone occupee sont precisees. Ont egalement ete pris en consideration les occupants « actifs » et les commandes specifiques des ouvertures et des ventilateurs.

This paper evaluates whether policy incentives to invest now, instead of tomorrow can be tailored to compensate for any option value to defer. A case study reviews a Dutch government subsidy program with the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) binomial method. Based on market priced risk, the subsidy properly compensates investors for the real option value they forgo by exercising the option and investing in a solar hot water system. A survey amongst homeowners reveals that private risks are an important part of the perceived uncertainty when investing in energy efficiency and should be included in the model. A practitioners' method is proposed that uses a binomial real option model to design policy incentives and surveys to assess the relevant uncertainties to include in the model. The results displayed in strategy spaces makes intuitive decisions possible.

AB  - The energy efficiency of US multifamily rental housing is compared with other housing types. A real and growing energy efficiency gap is documented, particularly for lower income households. Findings are based on data from the 2005 and 2009 US Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). Individual energy efficiency features related to HVAC (heating, ventilation and cooling) systems, appliances, and the building envelope are analysed along with weighted and unweighted total energy efficiency indices. Multifamily units occupied by low income renters had 4.1 fewer energy efficiency features in 2005 and 4.7 fewer in 2009 compared with other households. If the number of efficiency features was on par with other housing, the savings could be in the range of US$200–400 per year for most lower-income renters in multifamily buildings. There is an astonishing lack of information on how efficiency retrofits would affect property (real estate) metrics such as cash flow and value. Available evidence suggests that millions of US properties could be good retrofit investment opportunities. Better efficiency would allow renters to increase spending on food, healthcare and other essentials. This is not only an economic issue: it has implications for household health, social equity and environmental problems tied to energy consumption. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this paper we present an expert system for the energy performance evaluation of buildings. The system is obtained from the integration of different evaluation methodologies in a unified framework and results in a friendly tool made available to internet users, who can obtain, in real time, good quality performance certificates. The scope of the project is to develop a performance assessment of buildings that is both complete and flexible, and that could be extended to different environmental conditions. The project has been originated from the official European procedure EPBD 2002/91/CE which states the essential requirements in a performance-based building strategy. The expert system designed in the first stage of the project has been embedded in a software tool named BEEPS (Building Environment and Energy Performance System), where a Life Cycle Analysis technique is implemented to provide a material and energy balance over the entire life of the material, product or service. This embodies the knowledge of experts in energy evaluations and makes such knowledge available to users in a comprehensible and concise way. A dynamic set of rules processes the data on the building, draws the proper conclusions and constructs a certificate in textual form combining analysis, motivations and suggestions to improve the energetic efficiency of the considered building. The system has been customized for the production of energy performance certificates of buildings in Italy, taking into account climatic conditions, indoor environment requirements, and cost-effectiveness. Residential premises and winter have been considered in a first stage. In the paper we also describe the validation of the proposed tool on 120 case-studies related to residential real estate built in Rome during the last century. Additional components of the project that strongly contribute to the effectiveness of BEEPS are also described, such as the analysis of the building typology and the use of the Geographical Information System for data gathering. The full system is currently available on-line at www.beepsitalia.it. Practical application: In this paper an expert system for the energy performance evaluation of buildings is presented. The scope of the study is to develop a tool for the performance assessment of buildings that is both complete and flexible, and that could be extended to different environmental conditions which matches the European Directive EPBD 2002/91/CE. The expert system designed has been embedded in a software tool named BEEPS (Building Environment and Energy Performance System), this is available on-line at www.beepsitalia.it.

AB  - The energy transition will require considerable increases in energy efficiency, particularly in residential buildings. Financial support mechanisms, information and advice programs and dedicated training and certification of craftsmen are already in place to stimulate energy efficiency investment. Nevertheless, the required annual rate of thermal building refurbishment of around two percent is so far not achieved. For some real estate owners this may be explained by a investment horizon that is shorter than lifetime and repayment period of energy efficiency investment projects. The reluctance may also be due to an inadequate risk assessment by investors. Alternative financing approaches that rely mainly on the principle of coupling the revenues of the investment to actual energy cost savings and the increased involvement of equity capital might in such instances contribute to increasing investment activity. Particularly, in the current phase of low interest rates, there is more investment pressure on institutional investors whose willingness to participate in energy efficiency projects is likely to have increased substantially. Experience in other countries has however moderated expectations of being able to trigger greater short-term stimuli with innovative financial instruments. Nevertheless, given the challenges of the energy transition, further investigation of innovative financial concepts also based on equity funding seems warranted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

N2  - The implementation of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) is expected to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by providing actors with information that can be used to make better-informed decisions. This paper is the first to investigate EPCs in the Norwegian residential rental market. Applying the hedonic multilevel approach using information from some 440,000 rental contracts over the period of 2011-2018, we find that labeled dwellings have a premium compared with non-labeled dwellings, and that the premium is increasing with a higher EPC-label. We further define two classes of lessors--professional (real estate agents) and nonprofessionals (homeowners)--to study potential heterogeneity in EPC valuation and find that professionals assign higher rents compared with nonprofessionals. Dwellings with high energy efficiency are associated with a higher premium if rented out by a professional, a significant part of which stemming from higher EPC valuation. The results are robust to a number of heterogeneity analyses and after controlling for sample selection bias and unobserved locational heterogeneity. The findings of this paper signify the necessity to increase awareness and public dissemination regarding the EPC policy.

AB  - New energy technologies present opportunities for low-carbon housing but also significant upfront costs for house owners. Due to the long service life of such technologies, market valuation impacts on the feasibility of such investments. Yet, existing evidence on the market valuation of energy investments in private housing is inconclusive. Furthermore, despite significant policy efforts, energy performance certificates remain ineffective. This paper addresses these gaps with a study of real estate agents and the use of market devices, such as tools, databases, classification schemes, inspection protocols and market practices. Our analytical framework builds on the sociology of markets, actor network theory and pragmatist theories of valuation in order to highlight the material and discursive assemblages and arrangements that intervene in the construction of markets. Drawing on empirical evidence from Finland, the results point to asymmetries in market devices and valuation practices that disfavour energy investments compared to the other key quality attributes of housing.

AB  - China has become one of the most heavily polluted countries in the world with China's air pollution attracting claims from some international media of its spread to neighboring countries such as Korea and Japan, in order to bring to the concern of the international community. PM 2.5 (fine particles) pollution is one of the main sources of China's air pollution. The detrimental effect PM 2.5 pollution poses on health of residents and its hindrances to transportation has attracted the attention of many scholars who have conducted a wide range of investigations on PM 2.5 pollution. However, in spite of the avalanche of research on PM 2.5 pollution in China, majority of the existing studies in terms of methodology has usually investigated air pollution using the averaging method. In fact, the data distribution of socio-economic variables is often non-normal, with the tail having hidden important information. In order to overcome the shortcomings of existing research, this paper uses a quantile regression approach to explore the main driving forces of the difference in PM 2.5 pollution under high, medium and low emission levels. The results show that the effect of economic growth on PM 2.5 pollution in the upper 90th quantile provinces is the highest in all the quantile provinces due to the differences in fixed–asset investment and export trade. The impacts of energy efficiency in the 75th–90th and upper 90th quantile provinces are stronger than those in the lower 10th, 10th–25th, 25th–50th, and 50th–75th quantile provinces because of a big differences in research and development (R&D) funding and R&D personnel investment. The case of industrialization was similar on account of the differences in the industrial and building sectors. However, the empirical evidence showed that influences of urbanization in the 25th–50th and 50th–75th quantile provinces were lower than those in the other quantile provinces owing to the differences in motor vehicle and real estate industry. Thus, the heterogeneous effects of these driving forces on the different quantile provinces should be taken into consideration when discussing the mitigation of PM 2.5 pollution in China.

AB  - This paper compares energy-efficient appliance adoption rates across U.S. residential markets. The focus is to explore variation across tenure modes (rented or owner-occupied residences). Bivariate probits are used to correct for endogenous determination of tenure mode and energy efficiency outcomes. Results suggest that, when compared to renters, homeowners are significantly more likely to have energy-efficient appliances. The mechanisms that could be driving those differences are also investigated. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that rented dwellings are more likely to have efficient appliances when landlords incur utility payments. Adoption rate differences are also shown to be inversely related to energy prices. Those findings are consistent with a problem of asymmetric information in the housing market, typically referred to as the “landlord-tenant problem.” This paper is also the first to assess how tenancy duration influences efficiency investments in this context. Results suggest that investments in rented homes are more likely to occur at later periods of tenancy, when relations between landlords and tenants might be better established. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The article presents the views of two authors on Home Information Packs (HIP) making a difference to consumers and the house buying process in Great Britain. The first author agrees that HIP will make a difference because for him, it make home transactions faster and easier by providing a vehicle for the introduction of Energy Performance Certificates. The other author answers maybe because he do not know the impact of HIP on consumers or the housing market.

AB  - This study examined aspects of the "healthful living" concept in the Canadian housing market. This project focused on identifying what Canadian householders value and desire in the indoor environment of their homes, particularly with respect to the indoor air quality, lighting, and acoustics. A nationwide survey consisting of 3,592 Canadian households was conducted, revolving around issues of consumer demand for healthier homes. The major topics assessed were: 1) willingness to pay for better indoor environmental quality; and 2) householder choices and preferences for healthful living attributes. Modeling using logistic regression was conducted to determine whether the likelihood of paying more for better indoor environmental quality features could be predicted. Products and materials promoting energy efficiency, natural light, better insulation, and nonallergic qualities were preferred in a choice/preference question of nine attributes regarding healthier homes. There seem to be market opportunities for the healthy home concept to establish itself in the Canadian housing sector, which may serve to benefit the Canadian wood industry. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the U.S. real estate market, some types of appliances are expected to convey (be included) with the sale of a house, while other appliances may or may not convey depending on local norms that vary at the state level. An appliance that conveys will be left behind when a homeowner moves, while an appliance that does not convey may be kept until the end of its useful life. I estimate the effect of an appliance conveying using a difference-in-differences across states and appliance types, allowing me to fully control for state-level trends with fixed effects. I find that consumers purchase less expensive refrigerators and clothes washers when those appliances convey. This result indicates that the value of these appliances are not fully capitalized into home prices. I further show that accounting for whether an appliance conveys can substantially reduce or eliminate apparent undervaluation of energy efficiency benefits. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
