AB  - In order to foster energy-informed real estate decisions, the EU has universalised the energy performance certificates to be displayed on advertising for sale and rental. However, in Spain, such certificates are absent in a disturbing proportion of cases. This paper investigates the prevalence of this problem, its spatial patterns, and the concomitant architectonic and locative attributes. In doing so, data from 49,000 apartments listed for leasing and renting in Metropolitan Barcelona are analysed using conventional and spatial econometric methods. The results suggest that the probability that a listing includes the energy rating of the dwelling largely depends on other neighbouring listings. Furthermore, the information opacity exists for the worst dwellings, which are expected to be the most inefficient, located in areas inhabited by low-income population. That is, the population that could benefit the most from this policy is, precisely, the most uninformed.

AB  - Residential and commercial buildings comprise approximately forty percent of total energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. Yet, while California spends $1.5 billion annually on energy efficiency programs, limited research has explored how building energy consumption varies within cities, including the social and structural factors that influence electricity and natural gas use. We present results from an analysis of aggregated account-level utility billing data for energy consumption across the over two million properties in Los Angeles County. Results show that consumption in L.A. County varies widely with geography, income, building characteristics, and climate. Several higher-income areas have greater total energy use per building even in cooler climates, while many lower-income regions rank higher for energy use per square-foot. Energy consumption also correlates with building age, which varies widely throughout the region. Our results demonstrate the many complex and interrelated factors that influence urban energy use. While billing data is critical for devising energy efficiency programs that actually realize estimated savings and promote more sustainable cities, opening access to such data presents significant challenges for protecting personal privacy. The presented approach is adaptable and scalable to cities seeking to develop data-driven policies to reduce building energy use.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between residential buildings' energy efficiency labels and household energy expenditure, complementing an existing literature comparing theoretical and actual energy use. Residential building energy performance certificates indicate a theoretical energy use based on standardised assumptions about occupancy and energy service demand and are a market signal about the energy performance of a property. This paper quantifies the empirical relationship between households' expenditure on fuel and building energy performance using household expenditure survey data from the Republic of Ireland. The extent of this relationship, i.e. the size of the elasticity parameter, is of direct relevance to policy makers in the context of energy efficiency and climate policy targets. With building energy efficiency measured as a 15-point scale, we find that each rating decline along the scale is associated with a reduction in energy expenditure of 1.6%.

AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) were introduced by the European Union as a transparency tool in order to meet the targets of reducing the energy consumption of buildings. However, several inefficiencies hindered their implementation, resulting in a recast of the corresponding Directive coming into force in Germany in 2014. In 2012, Amecke (2012) was predicting that a “fundamental change” would occur due to the upcoming improvement of EPCs’ legal status. This follow-up investigation proves Amecke's assumption and expands the examination by comparing different target groups (tenants vs. owners) and elicitation methods (indirect approach via choice-based conjoint analysis vs. direct approach via self-explicated method). We analyzed the survey responses of 206 participants (108 tenants, 98 owners), which had been collected between May and July 2017. The results of the indirect approach suggest an ongoing change in the housing market, as energy efficiency achieves a high importance score similar to that of rent resp. price and of location. Owners are significantly more familiar with the EPC tool, giving it stronger consideration than tenants do. The results indicate three main policy implications concerning enhanced (i) transparency regulation and its compliance, (ii) environmental awareness, and (iii) communication of economic incentives.

AB  - Building sector consumes a significant amount of energy worldwide (up to 40% of the total global energy); moreover, by the year 2030 the consumption is expected to increase by 50%. One of the reasons is that the performance of buildings and its components degrade over the years. In recent years, energy benchmarking for government office buildings, large scale public buildings and large commercial buildings is one of the key energy saving projects for promoting the development of building energy efficiency and sustainable energy savings in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions and conventional air pollution. This paper focuses on energy benchmarking for shopping centers in Gulf Coast Region. In addition, this paper will analyze a sample of shopping centers data in Gulf Coast Region (Dubai, Ajman, Sharjah, Oman and Bahrain). It aims to develop a benchmark for these shopping centers by highlighting the status of energy consumption performance. This research will support the sustainability movement in Gulf area through classifying the shopping centers into: Poor, Usual and Best Practices in terms of energy efficiency. According to the benchmarking analysis in this paper, the shopping centers best energy management practices in the Gulf Coast Region are the buildings that consume less than 810 kW h/m2/yr, whereas the poor building practices are the centers that consume greater than 1439 kW h/m2/yr. The conclusions of this work can be used as a reference for shopping centres benchmarking with similar climate. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142151630012X]

AB  - Sustainable housing development is essential for achieving the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals. However, amid increasing housing deficits, investing in sustainable housing is widely perceived as a risky venture among policymakers and potential developers. This study explores the risk factors that hinder sustainable housing in developing economies using Ghana as a case study. Through a comprehensive literature review, a list of 30 risk factors was established and categorized into five thematic groups. These factors and groups were used to conduct a questionnaire survey among professionals in the Ghanaian housing market to assess progress on achieving sustainable development goals in housing and the risk factors that affect these. Fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) analysis conducted on risk factors revealed that 'financing-related' is the most critical risk category followed by 'procurement-related', 'design and construction', 'operation and maintenance' and 'political-related' risk factors. By prioritizing the risk categories, the findings apprise policymakers and practitioners of the risk factors that require more attention to achieve sustainable housing development. Additionally, the study stipulates measures for mitigating critical risks and for promoting efficient eminent domain on land, energy efficient retrofitting, transparent procurement, effective contractual strategies and efficient co-production and co-designing for sustainable housing development.

AB  - How to induce households to install energy efficient technology remains a puzzle. Could an energy labeling requirement for residential real estate help? We propose that the salient color-letter grades on the English Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) served as targets, motivating vendors to invest in energy efficiency. To test our hypothesis we look to a random sample of over 16,000 homes in England. In the post-EPC data we find a cluster of homes with energy efficiency scores just above the D-grade threshold. This cluster was not present prior to the requirement, replicates in an independently-drawn random sample and is significantly larger amongst properties that can be identified as treated by the EPC requirement. We conclude that the EPC requirement induced investment, and hence that energy efficiency labels have potential to green the housing stock. We infer from our analysis how the design of the EPC could be altered to motivate greater investment in energy efficiency.

AB  - "Responsible property investing" seeks to address social and environmental issues while achieving acceptable financial returns. It includes strategies such as investing in properties that are ENERGY STAR labeled, close to transit, and located in redevelopment areas. This study examines the financial performance of these types of properties. With few exceptions, over the past 10 years they had net operating incomes, market values, price appreciation, and total returns that were higher or the same as conventional properties, with lower cap rates. The findings reveal that responsible property investing can be practiced without diluting returns and can potentially yield higher profits for developers and investors. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Concerns about global warming and growing scarcity of fossil fuels require substantial changes in energy consumption patterns and energy systems, as targeted by many countries around the world. One key element to achieve such transformation is to increase energy efficiency of the housing stock. In this context, it is frequently argued that private investments are too low in the light of the potential energy cost savings. However, heterogeneous incentives to invest in energy efficiency, especially for owner-occupants and landlords, may serve as one explanation. This is particularly important for countries with a large rental sector, like Germany. Nevertheless, previous literature largely focuses on the payoffs owner-occupants receive, leaving out the rental market. This paper addresses this gap by comparing the capitalisation of energy efficiency in selling prices and rents, for both types of residences. For this purpose data from the Berlin housing market are analysed using hedonic regressions. The estimations reveal that energy efficiency is well capitalised in apartment prices and rents. The comparison of implicit prices and the net present value of energy cost savings/rents reveals that investors anticipate future energy and house price movements reasonably. However, in the rental segment, the value of future energy cost savings exceeds tenants' implicit willingness to pay by a factor of 2.5. This can either be interpreted as a result of market power of tenants, uncertainty in the rental relationship or the 'landlord-tenant dilemma'.

AB  - In cases in which indigenous resources comprise a small amount of a state's energy supplies, money spent on energy is transferred to export economies, reducing local spending on goods and services.  Prevention of this transfer via conservation increases household disposable income, which in turn, impacts areas like the local tax base, sales, and jobs.  It follows that a strong relationship can exist between energy efficiency and economic development.  In some areas, optimal energy conservation can be achieved without government intervention due to market incentives.  Nevertheless, institutional barriers in the rental sector contribute to a lack of thermal integrity in structures often inhabited by those who can least afford energy price increases.  The problems that are associated with achieving energy efficiency in rental housing are reviewed, and the approaches used by local governments to overcome barriers are reported.  The experience of Ithaca, New York, serves as an example.

AB  - Identifying the key influencing factors of CO2 emissions in China's iron and steel industry is vital for mitigating its emissions and formulating effective environmental protection measures. Most of the existing researches utilized time series data to investigate the driving factors of the industry's CO2 emission at the national level, but regional differences have not been given appropriate attention. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2000 to 2013 and panel data models to examine the key driving forces of CO2 emissions at the regional levels in China. The results show that industrialization dominates the industry's CO2 emissions, but its effect varies across regions. The impact of energy efficiency on CO2 emissions in the eastern region is greater than in the central and western regions because of a huge difference in R&D investment. The influence of urbanization has significant regional differences due to the heterogeneity in human capital accumulation and real estate development. Energy structure has large potential to mitigate CO2 emissions on account of increased R&D investment in energy-saving technology and expanded clean energy use. Hence, in order to effectively achieve emission reduction, local governments should consider all these factors as well as regional heterogeneity in formulating appropriate mitigation policies.

AB  - In line with global trends towards energy efficiency, Dubai's Government introduced Al Sa'fat Green Building Rating System (GBRS) to reduce the energy intensity of its building sector. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Al Sa'fat with emphasis on building energy performance, shedding light on its effectiveness, limitations, and techno-economic potential. Following a comparison of Al Sa'fat to international and regional GBRSs, a detailed energy-efficiency analysis is conducted using building performance simulations applied to local residential and commercial building archetypes. The benefits of adopting Al Sa'fat at the urban scale are then estimated using a macro techno-economic analysis. Results confirm the potential of Al Sa'fat in curbing current consumption patterns with energy savings ranging from 22% for hotel buildings to 63% for single-family villas. The anticipated monetary savings from adopting Al Sa'fat in Dubai are equally significant and could exceed USD 100 Billion over the next 25 years. Finally, recommendations are made to overcome critical limitations of Al Sa'fat, including the minimal emphasis on water efficiency measures and limited differentiation between its current certification levels (i.e., bronze, silver, gold, and platinum), which could discourage building owners and developers from pursuing high certification levels.

AB  - Increased demand for urban living, financial incentives for redevelopment, and conducive planning regulations are leading to significant commercial building reuse. This trend represents an opportunity to upgrade the energy performance of the existing building stock in older, more walkable downtowns and to achieve preservation goals. Some advocates of building reuse resist imposing the cost of energy improvements on associated projects, while many energy efficiency advocates do not distinguish how the opportunities and constraints differ between new and existing buildings. Building code officials experience this tension when reviewing improvements to existing buildings, and many find that sections of the widely adopted International Energy Conservation Code are pragmatically unenforceable. In this study we examine the existing-building energy challenge using a mixed-methods approach within one region as well as a national-level analysis of governmental data. The authors characterize promising regulatory strategies including exempting historic buildings (which is the status quo), exempting smaller buildings and less energy-intensive occupancies and systems, and creating simple lookup tables that provide succinct guidance to redevelopers and code officials. Code officials enforce longstanding life-safety codes more assiduously than they do the newer energy codes, and these codes need revisions to make them more cost effective and enforceable. A better understanding and implementation of building energy codes can have positive implications for both energy performance and downtown revitalization. Success depends on better managing interdependencies among the national policy objective of energy efficiency, the ubiquitous local planning objective of downtown revitalization, and the bureaucratic challenges of regulating construction in existing buildings. Planners should bring code officials into adaptive reuse projects early.

AB  - We investigate whether mandatory energy performance certificates of existing residential properties contribute to property price premiums after the implementation of the EU directive on the energy performance of buildings in the Swedish private housing market. Analysing mandatory energy performance certificates of the 2009-2010 private housing transactions, we find that energy performance is associated with transaction price in situations when it is conditional on a reference benchmark. We also document property price premiums for energy performance within housing segments built before 1960 and those with a lower transaction price per square metre. Our results suggest that the property market values energy performance, and we make recommendations on which housing segments need policy support to encourage energy improvements.

AB  - Strong rental protection in the affordable housing market often prohibits landlords from charging rental premiums for energy-efficient dwellings. This may impede (re)development of energy efficient affordable housing. In the Netherlands, affordable housing institutions regularly sell dwellings from their housing stock to individual households. If they can sell energy efficient dwellings at a premium, this may stimulate investments in the environmental performance of homes. We analyze the value effects of energy efficiency in the affordable housing market, by using a sample of 17,835 homes sold by Dutch affordable housing institutions in the period between 2008 and 2013. We use Energy Performance Certificates to determine the value of energy efficiency in these transactions. We document that dwellings with high energy efficiency sell for 2.0-6.3% more compared to otherwise similar dwellings with low energy efficiency. This implies a premium of some EUR 3,000 to EUR 9,700 for highly energy efficient affordable housing. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - Realising energy efficiency opportunities in new commercial office buildings is an easier task than retrofitting older, mid-tier building stock. As a result, a number of government programs aim to support retrofits by offering grants, upgrades, and energy audits to facilitate energy efficiency opportunities. This study reports on a state government program in Victoria, Australia, where the uptake of such offerings was lower than expected, prompting the program team to consider whether targeting facilities managers (FMs), rather than building owners, might be a better way of delivering the program. The influences and practices of FMs that impact on their ability to be advocates for energy efficiency were explored. The results revealed that complex building ownership arrangements, poor communication skills, isolation from key decision making processes, a lack of credible business cases and information, split incentives, and the prospect of business disruptions can all impact on FMs' ability to drive organizational change. Future program efforts should continue to interrogate the social context of retrofits in mid-tier buildings, including other influences and influencers beyond FMs, and adapt accordingly.

AB  - Досліджено сучасні тенденції розвитку житлового будівництва України в умовах істотного впливу системних соціально-економічних негараздів та чинників нестабільності. Виявлено низьку ефективність фінансово-кредитних механізмів, необхідних для вирішення житлових проблем населення та недостатню активність державних структур у сфері нового будівництва та модернізації застарілого житлового фонду. Встановлено, що потреба у доступному житлі залишається в країні доволі високою через незадовільні умови проживання населення, низькі стандарти житлової забезпеченості та якість житлових приміщень. Житлова проблема в Україні не знаходить вирішення протягом багатьох років, зберігаються високі соціальні очікування щодо цього у зв'язку з необхідністю оновлення житлового фонду. Попри зростання деяких показників житлової забезпеченості, в Україні зберігається значно вищий рівень перенаселеності житлових приміщень у порівнянні з країнами ЄС. Визначено, що нестабільність макроекономічної ситуації в країні, значні боргові зобов'язання перед європейськими партнерами стримують розвиток ринку нерухомості та модернізацію застарілого житла. Проте сучасне житлове будівництво розвивається завдяки поєднанню різних технологій, зростанню заінтересованості інвесторів у новому будівництві. У зв'язку з цим досліджено специфіку сучасних технології будівництва висотних будинків (цегляне, панельне, монолітно-каркасне, монолітне та збірне монолітно-каркасне) як фактору формування житлових умов населення, виявлено їхні переваги та недоліки в аспекті основних технічних і вартісних характеристик, а також доцільних сфер застосування. Визначено напрями розвитку житлового будівництва, зміни основних параметрів житла та рівня забезпечення ним населення країни. Узагальнено та систематизовано європейський досвід житлового будівництва та можливі джерела стимулювання його розвитку. Виявлено зміни на ринку нерухомості України за останні роки, насамперед у сегменті первинної нерухомості, зокрема зростання середньої житлової та загальної площі нових багатоповерхових забудов, підвищення інтересу інвесторів до зведення нових житлових комплексів. Установлено, що найвищі темпи введення в експлуатацію житлової нерухомості зберігаються у Києві та Київській області, містах Одесі та Львові. Розглянуто проблеми енергоефективності та екологічності будівництва в контексті можливостей поліпшення житлових умов населення, визначено напрями й шляхи їхнього розв'язання.

AB  - The UK Government has unveiled an ambitious retrofit programme that seeks significant improvement to the energy efficiency of the housing stock. High quality data on the energy efficiency of buildings and their related energy demand is critical to supporting and targeting investment in energy efficiency. Using existing home improvement programmes over the past 15 years, the UK Government has brought together data on energy efficiency retrofits in approximately 13 million homes into the Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), along with annual metered gas and electricity use for the period of 2004-2007. This paper describes the HEED sample and assesses its representativeness in terms of dwelling characteristics, the energy demand of different energy performance levels using linked gas and electricity meter data, along with an analysis of the impact retrofit measures has on energy demand. Energy savings are shown to be associated with the installation of loft and cavity insulation, and glazing and boiler replacement. The analysis illustrates this source of 'in-action' data can be used to provide empirical estimates of impacts of energy efficiency retrofit on energy demand and provides a source of empirical data from which to support the development of national housing energy efficiency retrofit policies.

AB  - In a new environment marked by the growing importance of Green House Gas emissions, fuel poverty, and energy efficiency in the different national agendas, the comprehension of energy demand factors appears to be crucial for the effectiveness of energy policies. We consider the latter could be improved by targeting specific household groups rather than looking to follow a single energy consumption level target. This article explores the scope of having a disaggregated energy consumption market to design policies aimed at curbing residential energy consumption or lowering its carbon intensity. Using a clustering method based on the CHAID (Chi Square Automatic Interaction Detection) methodology, we find that the different levels of energy consumption in the French residential sector are related to socio-economic, dwelling and regional characteristics. Then, we build a typology of energy-consuming households where targeted groups (fuel poor, high income and high consuming households) are clearly and separately identified through a simple and transparent set of characteristics. This classification represents an efficient tool for energy efficiency programs and energy poverty policies, but also for potential investors, which could provide specific and tailor made financial tools for the different consumer groups. Furthermore, our approach helps designing some energy efficiency score that could reduce the rebound effect uncertainty for each identified household group.

AB  - Green and energy-efficient technology and certification diffusion into the housing market could be significantly attenuated by limited or missing information. In this paper, we analyze this problem and respond to the question ''what diffusion patterns would we expect based on the problem of valuation of green homes in the absence of comparable attribute data supporting their value proposition?'' Further, we identify the problem in the context of the diffusion theory and the condition of inadequate information about the performance of these innovations. High-performance homes reflect green building innovations that involve non-trivial costs. Diffusion theory is a hypothesis used to outline the challenges faced by early-stage innovations, including those faced as they move from early-stage markets across Moore's chasm into more mainstream markets.

AB  - Home buyers and policymakers are becoming more conscious about the benefits that green building features can provide society. This has led to the adoption of green building and sustainable design and construction programs in a growing number of cities in the United States. In this paper, we describe the types of data typically available for capturing green features in residential research, which can be used in hedonic pricing models. We describe how GIS technology and a jurisdiction's mandatory policies can be used to obtain reliable green data. We demonstrate how to combine data on sustainability-related amenities to capture the association between green features and house prices. Following our suggestions should help researchers avoid making erroneous inferences and lead to more reliable estimates of how green amenities are associated with residential home transaction prices.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical analysis of the relation between energy factor markets, leasing structures, and the transaction prices of office buildings in the U.S. We employ a large sample of 15,133 office building transactions between 2001 and 2010. In addition to building characteristics, we also include information on the operating expenses, net operating income, and market capitalization rates at sale to estimate an asset-pricing model for commercial office real estate assets. A further set of important controls in our analysis is the forward/futures contract prices for electricity and natural gas. We also include weather metrics for each building’s location and sale date. Our final set of controls includes information on the dominant contractual leasing structure of the buildings. Our empirical results suggest that Energy Star labels do not explain additional variance in property prices once the key asset-pricing factors of expenses, income and market capitalization rates are included. By contrast, energy-factor market prices, the shape of the energy forward price curves, and weather metrics are consistently significant determinants of office building transaction prices, suggesting that commercial office building prices are exposed to shocks in these markets.

AB  - India is expected to add 40 billion m2 of new buildings till 2050. Buildings are responsible for one third of India's total energy consumption today and building energy use is expected to continue growing driven by rapid income and population growth. The implementation of the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) is one of the measures to improve building energy efficiency. Using the Global Change Assessment Model, this study assesses growth in the buildings sector and impacts of building energy policies in Gujarat, which would help the state adopt ECBC and expand building energy efficiency programs. Without building energy policies, building energy use in Gujarat would grow by 15 times in commercial buildings and 4 times in urban residential buildings between 2010 and 2050. ECBC improves energy efficiency in commercial buildings and could reduce building electricity use in Gujarat by 20% in 2050, compared to the no policy scenario. Having energy codes for both commercial and residential buildings could result in additional 10% savings in electricity use. To achieve these intended savings, it is critical to build capacity and institution for robust code implementation.

AB  - As the labor market in the U.S. remains weak, with high unemployment and sluggish job growth, policymakers at various levels of government are looking for new ways to support job growth and investment during an increasingly tight fiscal climate. Policies that promote the "Green Economy" in general and energy efficiency in particular remain politically popular as potential win-win solutions that will create jobs and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, efforts to promote energy efficiency in the residential sector through rebates and incentives alone have yet to reach critical mass. This paper outlines a policy option for state and local governments to use real estate transfer taxes to generate stronger incentives for home buyers to undertake significant retrofit projects at the time of sale. The economic impact of the proposed energy efficiency transfer tax (EETT) is then modeled for the State of North Carolina, using standard input-output techniques. Ultimately, based on housing sales figures from 2010, a new EETT of 2.5 percent on home purchases would generate a net positive increase of approximately 3485 direct construction jobs and 5900 annually total jobs for the state.

AB  - In 2010, the federal Australian government mandated the disclosure of energy performance ratings in advertisements for sale or lease of large commercial office properties. Prior to 2010, participation in the rating scheme was voluntary. This study first develops a theoretical model of mandatory disclosure policy effectiveness. Then, with a dataset of all ratings since inception of the voluntary regime in 1999, it tests the expectation that initial voluntary adopters have a greater tendency towards environmental stewardship and are more likely to manage and invest in environmental performance improvements, potentially dampening the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure policy. However, multiple statistical models of certification are unable to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in energy efficiency outcomes between the mandatory and voluntary adopters at equivalent stages. For urban policymakers, the extrapolation of voluntary adopter performance appears to be a good -- perhaps even conservative -- estimation of mandatory energy performance disclosure outcomes.

AB  - With the growing number of students in higher education, the student housing market has been becoming increasingly competitive and diversified. This intensification has led housing providers to supply all‐inclusive energy packages (i.e., the inclusion of electricity, gas, and water in the rent cost) to their tenants as a selling point. By connecting the geographies of students and energy, this paper aims to assess the magnitude of all‐inclusive energy packages and its effects on students’ residential choices. Based on an online survey distributed to students at Loughborough University (UK), the paper shows that 80% of housing occupied by students is energy‐inclusive. These rental commodities are strongly considered by students, particularly new university entrants, in their housing choices, 70% of whom considered all‐inclusive rent to be an important factor in their residential choice. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that all‐inclusive energy packages are extensively provided throughout the student housing market: from the low‐energy efficient houses in multiple occupancy to the newly developed purpose‐built student accommodation. Finally, the paper underpins how providing energy‐inclusive rent tends to produce energy inequities by shielding some students from being in fuel poverty.

AB  - Energy efficiency in the residential housing market can play an important role in the reduction of global carbon emissions. This paper reports the first evidence on the market adoption and economic implications of energy performance certificates implemented by the European Union. The results show that adoption rates are low and declining over time, coinciding with a negative sentiment regarding the label in the popular media. Labels are clustered among smaller, post-war homes in neighborhoods with more difficult selling conditions. We also document that geographic variation in the adoption rate of energy labels is positively related to the fraction of ''green'' voters during the 2006 national elections. Within the sample of labeled homes, the energy label creates transparency in the energy efficiency of dwellings. Our analysis shows that consumers capitalize this information into the price of their prospective homes. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - Evidence suggests that rental properties are often associated with lower levels of energy efficiency than owner-occupied buildings. Policy makers are increasingly concerned about this energy efficiency gap. In this paper, we investigate the energy investments made and the market efficiency gains associated with different policy interventions at the point of lease. We introduce key features of the housing rental market in the laboratory and examine four policy options: mandatory information on energy efficiency, voluntary information, mandatory minimum standards, and a 'cost-share' treatment (i.e., landlords pay a share of the tenants' energy bill). We find that enabling landlords to post the energy efficiency of their properties increases investment in energy efficiency. Voluntary information achieves efficiency levels comparable to those under a mandatory programme but may lead to lower levels of tenant participation. Mandatory minimum standards lead to higher investments in energy efficiency, but also reduce the number of properties available for lease. Cost-sharing leads to low market efficiency levels, perhaps due to the uncertainty landlords face regarding the energy bill of their tenants. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Following the transposition of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive into Irish law, all properties offered for sale or to let in Ireland are obliged to have an energy efficiency rating. This paper analyses the effect of energy efficiency ratings on the sale and rental prices of properties in the Republic of Ireland. Using the Heckman selection technique we model the decision to advertise the energy efficiency rating of a property and the effect of energy efficiency ratings on property values. Our results show that energy efficiency has a positive effect on both the sales and rental prices of properties, and that the effect is significantly stronger in the sales segment of the property market. We also analyse the effect of energy efficiency across different market conditions and we find that the effect of the energy rating is generally stronger where market conditions are worse.

AB  - Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are intended to provide tenants and buyers with reliable information about the energy performance of buildings. As improved energy performance may increase building sale prices and rents, the EPCs are supposed to generate incentives for owners to invest in energy efficiency. The empirical evidence for a price premium associated with energy labels is, however, inconclusive and partly contradictory. By utilizing data from the Norwegian housing market, we reproduce the positive price premium effect found in earlier studies. However, when we check these results by taking advantage of the fact that the introduction of a mandatory energy certification system represents a quasi-natural experiment, we find no evidence of a price premium. On the contrary, we present evidence that there is no effect of the energy label itself.

Policies considered include (1) accelerated building codes in residential and commercial buildings, (2) increased penetration of district heat metering and controls, (3) district heating efficiency improvement, (4) building energy efficiency labeling programs and (5) retrofits of existing commercial buildings. Among these programs, we found that the implementation of building codes provide by far the largest savings opportunity, leading to an overall 17% reduction in overall space heating and cooling demand relative to the baseline. Second are energy efficiency labels with 6%, followed by reductions of losses associated with district heating representing 4% reduction and finally, retrofits representing only about a 1% savings.

AB  - Information on sustainability features in the Australian residential property market is available but not always shared with buyers by property practitioners (real estate agents, property valuers/appraisers and financiers/mortgage lenders and brokers), as it is not a regulatory requirement. This paper examines the perspectives of property practitioners on a range of sustainability features in residential property. Drawing insights from combined questionnaires and interviews, property practitioners seem to attribute different levels of importance to sustainability related information depending on whether they view the information from their professional perspective or from their clients’ perspective. The results obtained in both 2015 and 2017 confirm that practitioners’ perspectives seem to limit the amount and/or type of information they pass on to their clients. Clients are not considering sustainability features as they may not be aware on the existence of such information and are not informed by practitioners about the value of such information. If practitioners share more complete information within the property market buyers would be able to make more informed purchase decisions regarding energy efficiency, sustainable homes, and reduction in operation costs. The property practitioners themselves can utilise this information to have more targeted and information rich marketing strategies.

AB  - Conveyance, i.e. the fact that an appliance purchased will be left in a dwelling when moving out, may lead homeowners to purchase appliances of lower quality or performance, because the extra costs are not entirely capitalized into the house sales price. Employing a discrete choice experiment with homeowners in the United States, this paper explores the effects of conveyance on homeowners' willingness-to-pay for various attributes of refrigerators. To account for the social nature of purchases when conveyance is likely to occur, it also tests the role of envy (elicited through an incentivized game). The findings provide evidence that conveyors are more likely than non-conveyors to purchase a smaller refrigerator, from a less well-known brand, and with lower customer ratings. In contrast, conveyance was not found to affect homeowners' choices when it comes to energy cost. In addition, envy was found to generally reinforce the negative effects of conveyance on homeowners' willingness-to-pay for several quality and performance attributes. While conveyance and its interaction with envy help explain why some homeowners choose certain quality/performance attributes of appliances, these factors do not appear to explain the energy efficiency paradox.

AB  - The five Nordic countries have aggressive climate and energy policies in place and have already emerged to be leaders in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Denmark is renowned for its pioneering use of wind energy, Finland and Sweden bioenergy, Norway hydroelectricity and Iceland geothermal energy. All countries aim to be virtually "fossil free" by 2050. This study explores the Nordic energy transition through the lens of three interconnected research questions: How are they doing it? What challenges exist? And what broader lessons result for energy policy? The study firstly investigates the pathways necessary for these five countries to achieve their low-carbon goals. It argues that a concerted effort must be made to (1) promote decentralized and renewable forms of electricity supply; (2) shift to more sustainable forms of transport; (3) further improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings; and (4) adopt carbon capture and storage technologies for industry. However, the section that follows emphasizes some of the empirical barriers the Nordic transition must confront, namely political contestation, technological contingency, and social justice and recognition concerns. The study concludes with implications for what such historical progress, and future transition pathways, mean for both energy researchers and energy planners.

AB  - A number of energy tax provisions expired at the end of 2014. Expired provisions include those that support renewable electricity (the production tax credit (PTC)), provisions that support energy efficiency in both residential and commercial buildings, and tax credits for certain biofuels and other alternative fuels. Like the 113th Congress, the 114th Congress may choose to address expired energy tax provisions. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (P.L. 113-295), enacted late in the 113th Congress, temporarily extended, through 2014, most expired energy tax provisions. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) proposes extending expired energy tax provisions for two years, through 2016. Energy tax policy may also be considered as part of comprehensive tax reform legislation. A base-broadening approach to tax reform might consider the elimination of various energy tax expenditures in conjunction with a reduction in overall tax rates. This was the approach taken in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1), introduced late in the 113th Congress by then-Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Dave Camp. Alternative revenue sources, such as a carbon tax, may also be evaluated as part of the tax reform process. The Obama Administration has also proposed a number of changes to energy tax policy as part of its annual budget proposal. In the past, the Administration has proposed repealing a number of existing tax incentives for fossil fuels, while providing new or expanded incentives for carbon sequestration, alternative and advanced technology vehicles, renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and advanced energy manufacturing. Energy tax policy involves the use of one of the government's main fiscal instruments, taxes (both as an incentive and as a disincentive) to alter the allocation or configuration of energy resources and their use. In theory, energy taxes and subsidies, like tax policy instruments in general, are intended either to correct a problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some economic (efficiency, equity, or even macroeconomic) objective. The economic rationale for government intervention in energy markets is commonly based on the government's perceived ability to correct for market failures. Market failures, such as externalities, principal-agent problems, and informational asymmetries, result in an economically inefficient allocation of resources-in which society does not maximize well-being. To correct for these market failures governments can utilize several policy options, including taxes, subsidies, and regulation, in an effort to achieve policy goals. In practice, energy tax policy in the United States is made in a political setting, determined by fiscal dictates and the views and interests of the key players in this setting, including policymakers, special interest groups, and academic scholars. As a result, enacted tax policy embodies compromises between economic and political goals, which could either mitigate or compound existing distortions.

AB  - The German Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires sellers on the housing market to provide detailed information on expected yearly energy consumption per square meter (energy performance, EPS). This paper uses variation in local fuel prices and climate, fuel types, and building ages to analyse the relationship between expected energy cost savings from energy efficient building structure and house prices in a data set of listing prices from all regions of Germany. Results suggest that heating cost considerations are less relevant than previously thought.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between residential buildings' energy efficiency labels and household energy expenditure, complementing an existing literature comparing theoretical and actual energy use. Residential building energy performance certificates indicate a theoretical energy use based on standardised assumptions about occupancy and energy service demand and are a market signal about the energy performance of a property. This paper quantifies the empirical relationship between households' expenditure on fuel and building energy performance using household expenditure survey data from the Republic of Ireland. The extent of this relationship, i.e. the size of the elasticity parameter, is of direct relevance to policy makers in the context of energy efficiency and climate policy targets. With building energy efficiency measured as a 15-point scale, we find that each rating decline along the scale is associated with a reduction in energy expenditure of 1.6%.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing global recognition of the need to reduce carbon emissions in response to climate change concerns. It is generally acknowledged that the energy efficiency of existing homes can be improved, but there are significant barriers to its uptake. In particular, improving the energy efficiency of private rental housing presents unique policy challenges due to a split-incentive problem. This has prompted some governments to introduce programmes that encourage landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. While landlords are responsible for the purchase of many energy-consuming household appliances, tenants are responsible for energy bills. Since the landlord does not reap the immediate benefits of investment in energy-efficient equipment, the incentives motivating such investment are weaker than for homeowners. This paper aims to quantify the magnitude of the split-incentive problem in the Australian private rental housing market by invoking a modelling approach where energy expenditure is estimated as a function of housing tenure, dwelling type, location, climate and other socio-demographic variables. We find no evidence in support of the split-incentive hypothesis in Australia. The paper concludes that differences in housing policy arrangements could be critical to the presence and importance of split incentives.

AB  - Global warming and depletion of petroleum resources have made the scientists to focus on new passive cooling techniques to reduce the indoor temperature of residential and commercial buildings. This paper explores the benefits of using coconut fibre composite as a passive cooling roof and quantifies those benefits in terms of heat flow changes through field experiment and compares them to the base case of standard roof in arid regions. The research also focussed on the usage of this material in combination with radiation reflectors such as aluminium and the effect of air gap between coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector on the energy efficiency of the buildings. Experimental investigation showed a substantial reduction in room air and concrete roof slab temperature of coconut fibre composite with aluminium reflector room in comparison with the conventional roof. A maximum reduction of 5.99 °C (16.59%) and 8.39 °C (23.8%) were observed in room air and roof slab temperature of coconut fibre composite–aluminium roof with an air gap of 40 cm between them. It was also observed that as the air gap between coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector is increased, the room air and roof slab temperature were reduced due to enhanced convective cooling. Compared to a standard roof, the indoor air temperature of coconut fibre composite roof was reduced by a maximum of 2.2 °C (5.86%), 2.9 °C and 5.99 °C (16.59%) for 0, 20 and 40 cm air gap between the coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector, respectively. It is convincingly demonstrated that the coconut fibre composite roof with aluminium reflector can significantly affect the indoor air and roof surface temperature of the roofs during the hot summer days.

AB  - There is an active and growing literature examining the rental rate, sales price, and occupancy premiums associated with sustainable or energy efficient certified real estate. To date, the focus has rested largely on office properties and for sale single family residential properties. We examine the rental rates achieved by green multifamily properties, providing the first look at the population of LEED market-rate apartments in the United States. We find an approximate 8.9 % rental rate premium associated with LEED apartments. Moreover, this research provides the first indication that LEED certification garners an additional premium over non-certified space that identifies as green, indicating the strength of the certification signal and contributing to the longstanding discussion on the merits of certification.

AB  - The "Energy Star" certification of residential homes is a recent attempt in the United States to improve energy efficiency in the residential sector by incentivizing home builders to "build green." We examine the effectiveness of this program by estimating homeowners' marginal willingness to pay for Energy Star residences in Gainesville, Florida. We use single-family residential property sales in Gainesville, Florida between 1997 and 2009. Using the hedonic method, we find that homeowners are willing to pay a premium for new Energy Star homes, but that this premium fades rapidly in the resale market.

AB  - Strong rental protection in the affordable housing market often prohibits landlords from charging rental premiums for energy-efficient dwellings. This may impede (re)development of energy efficient affordable housing. In the Netherlands, affordable housing institutions regularly sell dwellings from their housing stock to individual households. If they can sell energy efficient dwellings at a premium, this may stimulate investments in the environmental performance of homes. We analyze the value effects of energy efficiency in the affordable housing market, by using a sample of 17,835 homes sold by Dutch affordable housing institutions in the period between 2008 and 2013. We use Energy Performance Certificates to determine the value of energy efficiency in these transactions. We document that dwellings with high energy efficiency sell for 2.0-6.3% more compared to otherwise similar dwellings with low energy efficiency. This implies a premium of some EUR 3,000 to EUR 9,700 for highly energy efficient affordable housing. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516303482]

AB  - Using a unique dataset of 256,000 residential property sales for Portugal, this paper reveals a clear sales premium for energy efficiency, which is more pronounced for apartments (13%) than for houses (5 to 6%). Price premiums tend to increase from 2009 to 2013, a period in which the Portuguese housing market was depressed. Quantile regression reveals that, when compared with the rest of the sample, the group of the most energy efficient properties receives a statistically relevant price premium, that is mostly stable across the entire spectrum of the conditional price distribution. Cross-country comparisons suggest that energy efficiency price premiums are higher than those found for central and northern European markets. Illustrations on the effect of data issues in hedonic regression models are provided. They show how the use of appraisal prices and explanatory variables with measurement errors may seriously bias energy efficiency partial effect estimates. In contrast, the omission of variables associated with the quality of the properties has not produced relevant distortions. Finally, it became apparent that the use of smaller datasets would have produced similar results, as no significance inflation was produced by the Portuguese large scale dataset.

AB  - The energy efficiency of existing commercial buildings is more challenging to regulate and improve than the energy efficiency of new constructions. In 2011 and 2012, the Chinese Government selected four cities -- Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and Chongqing -- to implement pilot commercial building energy efficiency retrofit program. Based on site surveys and expert interviews in these pilot cities, this research conducted a comparative analysis on incentive policies of local city level. The analysis results show that policy designs of existing commercial buildings should be further improved. The aspects that influence the implementation effect in the future, such as subsidy level, installments, and business model promotion, should be specified in the policy clauses. Referring to the technical solution and cost-benefit in Chongqing, we found that lighting system is the most common retrofit objects while envelope system is the least common one. And the subsidy incentive is greatest for educational buildings, followed by office buildings. In the end, we further discussed the problems and obstacles in commercial building retrofit market, and provided a series of recommendations.

AB  - China is now the world's largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter, and the government is under tremendous pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. The heavy industry sector is the largest contributor to the growth of CO2 emissions. Investigating the driving factors of this industry's CO2 emissions has important practical value. This paper applies the geographically weighted regression model to survey this industry's CO2 emissions. Empirical results show that urbanization exerts a heterogeneous impact on CO2 emissions across provinces and regions. This is mainly due to the differences in urban real estate and transportation infrastructure investments. Economic growth drives CO2 emissions, and this effect varies significantly by region and province on account of the differences in fixed-asset investment. It is more reasonable for local governments to develop emerging economies based on their specific conditions. Energy efficiency has the highest impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region, because of the differences in R&D personnel investment and the number of patents granted. The energy consumption structure has the largest impact on CO2 emissions in the eastern region since it consumes more coal. Environmental regulations have a greater impact on CO2 emissions in the western region due to the differences in investment for industrial pollution control.

AB  - The UK's housing stock generates approximately 27% of the country's total annual carbon emissions. In light of the legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions, new housing is subject to a tightening of regulations governing energy demand and efficiency resulting in a gradual improvement in carbon emissions. The question is how to achieve the deep carbon emission reductions from existing domestic properties, of which 75% will still be in use in 2050. Government has sought to provide incentives to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their households, and mandate improvements in socially rented housing using a range of fiscal measures, most recently the 'Green Deal'. There has however been little consideration of the 18% of UK households who privately rent their home, a tenure that is growing fast. The aim of this research is to investigate the factors that influence private sector landlords when considering energy efficiency improvements to their tenanted homes. The results indicate that government policy has consistently failed to engage private sector landlords in the issue of energy efficiency and thus measures must be taken to understand the motivations of landlords in order to design effective incentives and interventions.

AB  - The China Design Standard for Energy Efficiency in public buildings (GB 50189) debuted in 2005 when China completed the 10th Five-Year Plan. GB 50189-2005 played a crucial role in regulating the energy efficiency in Chinese commercial buildings. The standard was recently updated in 2014 to increase energy savings targets by 30% compared with the 2005 standard. This paper reviews the major changes to the standard, including expansion of energy efficiency coverage and more stringent efficiency requirements. The paper also discusses the interrelationship of the design standard with China's other building energy standards. Furthermore, comparisons are made with ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 to provide contrasting differences in efficiency requirements. Finally recommendations are provided to guide the future standard revision, focusing on three areas: (1) increasing efficiency requirements of building envelope and HVAC systems, (2) adding a whole-building performance compliance pathway and implementing a ruleset based automatic code baseline model generation in an effort to reduce the discrepancies of baseline models created by different tools and users, and (3) adding inspection and commissioning requirements to ensure building equipment and systems are installed correctly and operate as designed.

AB  - This paper incorporates environmental psychology insights into a well-being framework related to the built environment to predict the relations between green buildings and their residents in terms of pro-environmental behavior and well-being. To test our predictions, we apply a generalized structural equation modelling technique to a household survey dataset collected from the Singapore private housing market. We find that green building residents have a higher assessment of their residential environment. This increases the level of their residential satisfaction, which subsequently enhances their quality of life and reduces their intention to move. We demonstrate that green buildings provide a supportive and educational environment for motivating and educating their residents to behave in a pro-environmental manner. Residents' improved pro-environmental behavior and enhanced well-being are attributed to some, though not all, green features. We find that tangible green features (i.e., greenery, ventilation, indoor environments, and waste facilities) have greater impacts on residents than intangible ones (i.e., energy efficiency and accessibility to public transport). The findings contribute ideas and solutions to the future development of green buildings by taking a social perspective to pursue urban sustainability. This paper also inspires future multi-disciplinary research at the intersection of urban studies, psychology, and behavioral science.

AB  - We investigate whether mandatory energy performance certificates of existing residential properties contribute to property price premiums after the implementation of the EU directive on the energy performance of buildings in the Swedish private housing market. Analysing mandatory energy performance certificates of the 2009-2010 private housing transactions, we find that energy performance is associated with transaction price in situations when it is conditional on a reference benchmark. We also document property price premiums for energy performance within housing segments built before 1960 and those with a lower transaction price per square metre. Our results suggest that the property market values energy performance, and we make recommendations on which housing segments need policy support to encourage energy improvements.

AB  - This paper investigates whether energy performance ratings, as measured by mandatory Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are reflected in the sale prices of residential properties. This is the first large-scale empirical study of this topic in England involving 333,095 dwellings sold at least twice in the period from 1995 to 2012. Applying hedonic regression and an augmented repeat sales regression, we find a positive relationship between the energy efficiency rating of a dwelling and the transaction price per square metre. The price effects of superior energy performance tend to be higher for terraced dwellings and flats compared to detached and semi-detached dwellings. The evidence is less clear-cut for rates of house price growth but remains supportive of a positive association. Overall, the results of this study suggest that energy efficiency labels have a measurable and significant impact on house prices in England.

Our theoretical model demonstrates that the initial green premium can be negative but becomes positive as the building ages if a green building has a higher life-cycle cost and a longer economic life. Our empirical analysis of green condominiums in Tokyo confirms this prediction. We additionally find that the longer-life design is associated with a price premium, but the use of renewable energy and recycled materials and water is associated with price discounts. The price discounts are interpreted as the capitalization of a greater life-cycle user cost.

AB  - Energy labels have generally received positive response from consumers and have moved the market for white goods and cars in the direction of more energy-efficient products. On the real estate market, it was expected that an energy label, rating the energy performance of a property based on a national energy performance certificate (EPC) might receive similar response. However, in Denmark no response to the energy performance rating was observed for 15 years. This was a surprise considering that Denmark was the first country to implement an A to G rating of the energy performance of buildings. A statistical examination of data on property sales prices and energy performance ratings was carried out. All relevant property transaction data from 2007 till 2012 were examined and they showed that energy performance ratings had an impact on property sales prices. However, before June 2010, the impact was modest, whereas after June 2010 the impact of energy performance ratings on property sales prices increased significantly as a result of an EU requirement to display the energy performance rating in connection with property sales. On this background, it was concluded that a public display of the energy performance rating is fundamental for market response.

AB  - The building energy efficiency labeling (BEEL) scheme has been adopted in China since 2008. However, until now, its effect on the actual building energy efficiency has not been accurately established. The objective of this study was to investigate this effect through a case study in Shanghai, China. Additionally, by performing a thorough review, potential barriers for implementing the BEEL scheme in major areas of China were analyzed. The results indicated that 1) the energy use intensity of labeled commercial office buildings in Shanghai followed a normal distribution, with an average value of 79.14 kWh/(m2a); 2) the energy-saving rate and energy consumption exhibited an inversely proportional relationship for residential buildings, but this relationship was not applicable for commercial office buildings; 3) for Shanghai, ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) and variable refrigerant volume systems are more appropriate for commercial office buildings, and GSHPs and split air conditioners are more useful for residential buildings. The potential barriers were classified into three main categories-technical, political, and awareness-and corresponding solutions were proposed. The authors hope that this study can promote the adoption of the BEEL scheme in China.

AB  - The U.S. government has invested in multifamily housing through an array of subsidized housing programs. These programs provide a venue for understanding how regulations governing multifamily housing can affect an owner's incentive to make energy efficient investments, and a tenant's desire to reduce their energy consumption levels. This paper empirically tests the impact of subsidized housing regulations on the energy efficiency of multi-family housing for low-income households. We begin by constructing a unique database that integrates actual energy use with physical, socioeconomic, and regulatory characteristics of all large multifamily properties in New York City, focusing on whether a property receives a federal rental subsidy. We employ multivariate regression models to examine the factors that influence energy consumption in multi-family buildings and compare subsidized housing to market-rate housing, controlling for a range of building and household characteristics. We find that subsidized properties are associated with higher energy consumption than similar market-rate properties and, of the subsidized housing programs, Public Housing tends to consume the most energy. Our results suggest that despite the potential for retrofitting multifamily properties, and associated cost, energy, and carbon emissions savings, regulatory factors constrain investment and consumption decisions in the case of subsidized properties. Reducing energy use in subsidized housing, therefore, rests on modifying existing regulations.

AB  - This paper seeks to elucidate whether high levels of non-disclosure lead to adverse market outcomes in the form of the well-known lemons problem. It also empirically tests whether energy-efficiency ratings (EERs) are reflected in both housing sales prices and rents in the Australian Capital Territory, the only Australian housing market with mandatory ratings for all dwellings at point of sale or lease. Using a comprehensive dataset of sale and lease transactions during the period 2011–2016, a hedonic framework is applied. The analysis confirms that both the reported energy-efficiency levels and other sustainability-related characteristics that are not part of the formal rating assessment influence the pricing of both sales and rental transactions. Characteristics such as heating and cooling systems and the presence of solar power generators are significantly reflected in rents and sales prices, as tenants and buyers are likely to estimate their expected utility costs based on the EER. It is also shown that the option of leaving the EER of a rental property unreported presents a moral hazard for landlords of sub-standard properties, in that the likelihood of EER disclosure increases in line with the number of energy-efficient features of a property as revealed in the marketing material. The analysis also reveals that socio-economically disadvantaged areas suffer from disproportionately higher levels of EER non-disclosure, potentially constituting a ‘double disadvantage’ of non-disclosure and low–energy efficiency dwelling stock. From a market and asset-pricing perspective, it thus seems preferable to extend the requirement to obtain and present a valid EER to the rental market.

AB  - The residential sector is an important target area for achieving Europe's 2020 energy saving aims. There is virtually no evidence, however, of how incentives for attaining energy efficiency interact with countries' regional development aims. This article presents recent experiences from Estonia, where an energy renovation subsidy programme financed with carbon emission trading funds was carried out between 2010 and 2014. We show that despite equal access to subsidies for residents living in various places, a regionally unequal distribution of subsidies occurred. Empirical analyses confirm that low-performing regions acquire less public subsidy, thus adding another layer of regional inequality to existing socio-economic differences. Findings suggest that renovation subsidy distribution is related to regional socio-economic indicators and that real estate value explains 40% of subsidy distribution variations between regions. Although the energy policy goal of carbon conservation is important, ignoring the location and organisational capacity of local communities results in missed opportunities to mitigate growing regional disparities.

AB  - Since January of 2005, 250 building projects in the City of Singapore have been awarded the Green Mark for energy efficiency and sustainability. This paper analyzes the private returns to these investments, evaluating the premium in asset values they command in the market. We analyze almost 37,000 transactions in the Singapore housing market to estimate the economic impact of the Green Mark program on Singapore's residential sector. We adopt a two-stage research design; in the first stage, a hedonic pricing model is estimated based on transactions involving green and non-green residential units in 697 individual projects or estates. In the second stage, the fixed effects estimated for each project are regressed on the location attributes of the projects, as well as control variables for a Green Mark rating. Our results suggest that the economic returns to green building are substantial. This is one of the first analyses of the economics of green building in the residential sector, and the only one analyzing property markets in Asia. Our results provide insight about the operation of the housing market in one country, but the policy implications about the economic returns to sustainable investments in the property market may have broader applications for emerging markets in Asia.

AB  - In the last 30 years, voluntary and mandatory environmental or energy certification schemes have been introduced in the building sector in most developed countries. During the last decade, in Brazil, the document Energy Efficiency Rating Technical Quality Regulations for Commercial, Service and Public Buildings (RTQ-C) was introduced to classify buildings according to their energy efficiency level. This paper aims to assess how Brazilian RTQ-C could learn from the European Union (EU)'s experience of implementing the Directive 2010/31/EU. The implementation of the RTQ-C in Brazil has been examined and compared with the EU's Directive. Technical, economic and social issues as well as barriers and challenges behind the initial stage of the Directive 2010/31/EU implementation were examined. The difficulties and weaknesses of the calculation methodology, scope and labelling of the Brazilian RTQ-C regulations, and potential areas that require further research have been identified and summarised. In order to increase the impact of RTQ-C regulations, improvements to the existing calculation methodology and tools, provision of numerous supporting measures, such as an increase in training, education, public awareness and incentives, and enforcement through building regulations or standards are essential. The valuable experience from the EU's implementation of the Directive could be used to guide the development of energy policies and certification regulations in Brazil.

AB  - The Chinese central government introduced the ‘Chinese Green Building Label’ in 2008, which makes China one of the few developing countries with an official rating system of buildings’ performance in sustainability. This paper investigates the existence and magnitude of the price premium associated with this official green label in the residential sector. Based on a unique data set of green-labelled, newly built housing projects and their non-labelled counterparts from around the country in 2013, an empirical analysis suggests that the labelled housing projects attract a price premium of 6.9% compared with their non-labelled counterparts. Further analysis suggests that this official green label is more effective as a reliable signal of buildings’ energy efficiency in the Chinese context compared with developers’ self-advertised ‘greenness’. These results provide preliminary evidence that with this official rating system, the investment in buildings’ energy-efficiency could be potentially profitable for housing developers in China, and such profitability may herald a rapid development of the green housing market in urban China.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to test for the persistence of the landlord-tenant energy efficiency problem in the residential rental property market in the presence of information on property energy performance. To do this, we compare the efficiency of rental and non-rental properties using a combination of Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) and parametric regression. We use a sample of 585,578 residential properties in the Republic of Ireland - a region that legally requires rental properties to display energy performance certificates when advertised. The findings suggest that the landlord-tenant problem is present in the Irish rental market but that it is not uniform across locations, indicating the influence of other factors. To explore this further, we exploit the regional variation in rental property prices. We find a larger difference between rental and non-rental properties' energy efficiency in markets with scarcity in rental property supply. In addition, we are able to take advantage of a unique trait in building design to compare rental and non-rental properties which were identical at the time of their construction. The findings from this sub-group mirror our finding for the sample as a whole.

AB  - There is significant potential for reducing energy use and emissions from buildings through energy efficiency retrofits. However, a number of barriers, including long payback periods and uncertainties around business models and technologies, restrict large scale implementation. A recent joint project, piloting green energy schemes and low-carbon investments in public and commercial buildings in the Changning district of Shanghai, China, indicated opportunities to break through these barriers. This study conducted a cost benefit analysis to investigate how an innovative combination of financial and non-financial supported retrofits, and could serve as a model for other urban areas. In total, 44 retrofit sub-projects were carried out and achieved energy savings of 30,217 tons of coal equivalent. The average payback period was 2.43 years, and with subsidies was further reduced to 1.79 years. The Changning Low Carbon Office played a critical role in coordinating and supporting the uptake of retrofit measures but non-economic factors continue to restrict investment by financial institutions and the implementation of retrofits on a larger scale.Key policy insightsPublic and commercial building retrofits in Shanghai are found to generate commercially acceptable payback periods while having achieved significant energy and emissions reductions.Subsidies from the city and district governments significantly reduced the payback periods of energy efficiency retrofits, but may also crowd out investment by financial institutions.The Changning Low Carbon Office has coordinated energy efficiency retrofitting efforts, provided access to information, helped to connect investment funds with project opportunities and support project management.Achieving the deeper retrofits needed to achieve China’s climate targets may require more substantial financial incentives.

AB  - As the labor market in the U.S. remains weak, with high unemployment and sluggish job growth, policymakers at various levels of government are looking for new ways to support job growth and investment during an increasingly tight fiscal climate. Policies that promote the 'Green Economy' in general and energy efficiency in particular remain politically popular as potential win-win solutions that will create jobs and curb greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, efforts to promote energy efficiency in the residential sector through rebates and incentives alone have yet to reach critical mass. This paper outlines a policy option for state and local governments to use real estate transfer taxes to generate stronger incentives for home buyers to undertake significant retrofit projects at the time of sale. The economic impact of the proposed energy efficiency transfer tax (EETT) is then modeled for the State of North Carolina, using standard input-output techniques. Ultimately, based on housing sales figures from 2010, a new EETT of 2.5 percent on home purchases would generate a net positive increase of approximately 3485 direct construction jobs and 5900 annually total jobs for the state.

AB  - The German government is aiming for a climate-neutral building stock before 2050 to meet the defined goals of the Climate Action Plan 2050. Increasing the building stock's energy efficiency is therefore a high priority, and investments by private homeowners will greatly influence this, as around 46.5% of German homes are owner-occupied. To identify the possible monetary benefits of investments in energy retrofits, we investigate whether energy efficiency is reflected in the property values of German single-family homes. Therefore, we examine potential heterogeneous effects across regions. With 422,242 individual observations on a 1 km2-grid level from 2014 to 2018, this study adds to the extant literature by 1) examining the energy efficiency effect on housing values for the entire country and specifically investigating regional disparities in this context, and 2) estimating an energy efficiency value-to-cost ratio to compare housing values' increase with initial investment costs and future energy cost savings. Applying hedonic analysis, we find a positive relationship between energy efficiency and asking prices. If energy efficiency increases by 100 kWh/m2 a, prices increase by 6.9% on average. We also find evidence for regional disparities. The effects are significantly weaker in large cities than in other urban areas, whereas the impact in rural regions is much stronger. According to this, housing shortage and higher purchasing power per capita were identified as drivers for low energy efficiency premiums. Finally, there is evidence that about 98% of future energy cost savings are already reflected in a higher housing value under myopic expectations regarding future energy prices.

AB  - Sustainability alliance networks offer a collaborative governance strategy to address both environmental and societal challenges too large for any single organization. While alliance networks, and particularly sustainability alliances, have been studied in a number of contexts, few alliances have been explored under the context of commercial building energy use—a sector with a multitude of policy, organizational, and technical barriers to the deployment of innovative energy‐ and cost‐saving strategies. In this research, we articulate a framework wherein organizations can assume varying roles across an alliance network based on the organizations' objectives, organizational resources, and the relationships or ties formed with other alliance members. Further, we show that particular roles within one alliance network have implications for the types of knowledge gained and the knowledge shared across the network. Our mixed‐method study draws from several data sources, employs analytic induction, and is supplemented by social network analysis in order to examine an energy efficiency‐focused sustainability alliance comprised of a broad coalition of stakeholders, including US government agencies, federally funded research laboratories, private firms, and trade associations. We develop a typology for six types of organizational roles identified in an energy efficiency alliance network—each role possessing varying implications for the organization's access to and sharing of knowledge.

AB  - This paper compares energy-efficient appliance adoption rates across U.S. residential markets. The focus is to explore variation across tenure modes (rented or owner-occupied residences). Bivariate probits are used to correct for endogenous determination of tenure mode and energy efficiency outcomes. Results suggest that, when compared to renters, homeowners are significantly more likely to have energy-efficient appliances. The mechanisms that could be driving those differences are also investigated. Heterogeneity analyses reveal that rented dwellings are more likely to have efficient appliances when landlords incur utility payments. Adoption rate differences are also shown to be inversely related to energy prices. Those findings are consistent with a problem of asymmetric information in the housing market, typically referred to as the “landlord-tenant problem.” This paper is also the first to assess how tenancy duration influences efficiency investments in this context. Results suggest that investments in rented homes are more likely to occur at later periods of tenancy, when relations between landlords and tenants might be better established.

AB  - It is widely recognized that the adoption of energy saving innovations can induce an increase in the usage of the corresponding technologies and thus can possibly increase energy consumption. Among other concerns is that uncertainties regarding the magnitude of this "rebound effect" can deter policy makers from promoting energy efficiency. This paper analyzes the rebound effects of the adoption of energy efficient technologies in commercial buildings. Based upon a structural model of technology adoption and subsequent energy demand at the building level, the empirical results are that energy efficiency can reduce electricity use by about 35 % and natural gas consumption by about 50 %.

AB  - Buildings consume a major proportion of the electricity power in most cities, thus promoting building energy efficiency (BEE) will directly contribute to low carbon cities. Some studies suggest that the additional investment on BEE should be well paid off by higher selling prices or more savings in term of life cycle costing. Real estate developers are profit driven and working in a competitive environment. However, it appears that real estate developers are skeptical in entering the BEE market, which requires alternate theories to explain their behaviors. In this study, we attempt incorporating transaction cost economics (TCE) and game theoretical frameworks into the analysis. It suggests that the anticipated transaction costs entailed in the provision of BEE products due to such factors as bounded rationality, opportunism and contractual hazards, combined with the asymmetrical information in the BEE market have curtailed the developers' interests. This study also leads to suggesting some policy recommendations to induce the developers entering into the BEE market by reducing the transaction costs. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - The residential sector accounts for 33% of electricity consumption in the U.S., with a total expenditure of $166 billion in 2010. Increasing the energy efficiency of the durable housing stock can thus provide significant cost savings for consumers. One promising trend is the rise of homes labeled by a third party as 'green' or energy efficient. This paper documents evidence on the effects of providing information about the energy efficiency and 'sustainability' of structures in affecting consumer choice. We conduct a hedonic pricing analysis of all single-family home sales in California over the time period 2007 to 2012, and find that homes labeled with a green label transact at a small premium relative to otherwise comparable, non-labeled homes. We show evidence of spatial variation in this capitalization such that both environmental ideology and local climatic conditions play a role in explaining the variation in the green premium across geographies.

AB  - This paper focuses on the effect of energy performance ratings on appraised capital values, rental values and equivalent yields of UK commercial property assets. The study is based on a cross-section of 708 commercial property assets. Incorporating a range of potential confounding factors such as unexpired lease term, vacancy rate and tenant credit risk, we use hedonic regression procedures to estimate the effect of EPC rating on rental and capital values. The study finds no evidence of a significant relationship between environmental and/or energy performance and rental and capital values. A small subset of 24 BREEAM-rated assets is also tested for significant price effects but a statistically significant effect is only confirmed for equivalent yields. Similarly, there was no evidence that the EPC rating had any effect on Market Rent or Market Value with only minor effects of EPC ratings on equivalent yields. The preliminary conclusion is that energy labelling is not yet having the effects on Market Values and Market Rents that would be expected if high EPC ratings were associated with substantial cost savings that are fully reflected in capital values and/or were readily available and taken into account by prospective tenants and buyers.

AB  - This paper investigates the effect of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings on residential prices in Wales. Drawing on a sample of approximately 192,000 transactions, the capitalisation of energy efficiency ratings into house prices is investigated using two approaches. The first adopts a cross-sectional framework to investigate the effect of EPC rating on price. The second approach applies a repeat-sales methodology to investigate the impact of EPC rating on house price appreciation. Statistically significant positive price premiums are estimated for dwellings in EPC bands A/B (12.8%) and C (3.5%) compared to houses in band D. For dwellings in band E (-3.6%) and F (-6.5%) there are statistically significant discounts. Such effects may not be the result of energy performance alone. In addition to energy cost differences, the price effect may be due to additional benefits of energy efficient features. An analysis of the private rental segment reveals that, in contrast to the general market, low-EPC rated dwellings were not traded at a significant discount. This suggests different implicit prices of potential energy savings for landlords and owner-occupiers. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516300258]

AB  - The housing sector is a substantial consumer of energy, and therefore a focus for energy savings efforts. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), introduced in 2002 and revised in 2010, is a key instrument to increase the energy performance of buildings across the European Union. Following the implementation of the EPBD into Spanish law, all properties offered for sale or rented out in Spain are required to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). Given that the implementation of the EPC scheme for new, existing and advertised properties is still very low in Spain, unlike other European housing markets, the Spanish one lacks market data on energy efficiency (EE) labels and their impact on housing price. To overcome this gap, we determine the EE ratings of a sample of 1507 homes across Spain on the basis of information collected previously through household surveys. This allowed us to answer the question of whether or not, and to what extent, Spanish housing markets capitalise the value of EE. We apply the hedonic-price technique and observe that more energy efficient dwellings have a price-premium between 5.4% and 9.8% compared to those with the same characteristics but lower EE level.

AB  - The Directive 2002/91/CE introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), an energy policy tool. The aim of the EPC is to inform building buyers about the energy performance and energy costs of buildings. The EPCs represent a specific energy policy tool to orient the building sector and real-estate markets toward higher energy efficiency buildings. The effectiveness of the EPC depends on two factors: *The accuracy of energy performance evaluation made by independent experts. *The capability of the energy classification and of the scale of energy performance to control the energy index fluctuations.  In this paper, the results of a case study located in Italy are shown. In this example, 162 independent technicians on energy performance of building evaluation have studied the same building. The results reveal which part of confidence intervals is dependent on software misunderstanding and that the energy classification ranges are able to tolerate the fluctuation of energy indices. The example was chosen in accordance with the legislation of the Emilia-Romagna Region on Energy Efficiency of Buildings. Following these results, some thermo-economic evaluation related to building and energy labelling are illustrated, as the EPC, which is an energy policy tool for the real-estate market and building sector to find a way to build or retrofit an energy efficiency building.

AB  - Using a unique transaction database of condominiums in the Tokyo metropolitan area and a hedonic analytical framework, we find that eco-labeled buildings command a small but significant premium on both the asking and transaction prices. This finding is consistent with results from other countries but in contrast to these studies, the present analysis also incorporates buyer characteristics which provide further information on the sources of demand for eco-labeled real estate. A separate estimation by subgroups reveals that the price premium is primarily driven by wealthier households that exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay for eco-labeled condominiums, both as a total amount and as a fraction of the total sales price. Less affluent households are also shown to pay higher prices for the eco label but the effect is less pronounced. The results indicate that capitalised utility bill savings are likely to account for a large proportion of the observed premium but the higher premium paid by affluent households suggests that more intangible benefits of living in a green building may also play a role.

AB  - Research background: The implementation of EU directives in national legislations imposes an obligation to monitor energy efficiency in every sector of the economy, including construction. In the era of energy conservation, which results from environmental requirements, as well as from constantly increasing energy prices, the energy consumption of premises and buildings becomes an important prerequisite for decision-making processes in the real estate market. There have also been changes in the provisions of the Act on Real Estate Management, which impose an obligation on the professional group of property appraisers to incorporate energy performance certificates for buildings and premises into the valuation process. Energy intensity in terms of the demand for heating of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units.Purpose: The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high-rise buildings) and the diverse distribution of units in the building, especially with regard to their exposure to the different point of the compass. The research covered the Słoneczne housing estate in Szczecin, in a situation where the property appraiser does not have access to the energy performance certificates of the estimated apartments as well as apartments taken for comparison. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between energy intensity and market value of residential units on the selected real estate market. The analysis will be based on data from the Price and Value Register of the County Office, a collection of statistics and public information as well as on the authors’ own databases and research.Research methodology: A multidimensional analysis will be used to distinguish homogeneous groups of residential units due to their property attributes. The study will also employ a valuation model including energy intensity and time variables.Results: The study showed that building type is one of the features determining energy consumption by a building. Depending on the period, the introduced attributes explained the evolution of the unit price at 78%, 75% and 24%. The parameters of the variables Size, Neighborhood and Time were found to be statistically significant. What is more, in all three periods, the value of the residential unit was significantly affected by the type of building which determined the energy performance of the building.Novelty: Energy intensity in terms of the heating demand of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units. The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high buildings) and the different location of units in a building, especially in relation to the directions of the world.

AB  - This paper analyzes the tax incentives and aids adopted in the taxes and environmental policies to improve the energy efficiency of Spanish households. The established environmental policy presents advances although with incipient results, since the energy efficiency of the houses still plays a secondary role. In the area of taxes, no tax incentives have been effective in reducing the investment in improvements in the energy efficiency of homes, especially in those of old construction. Our conclusions indicate the convenience of promoting the energy efficiency of homes through the fiscal route. In this sense, it proposes incorporating an incentive to the Personal Income Tax linked to improved energy rating of housing. Also, it raises the improvements in the current regulations on tax benefits on the Real Estate Tax and on the Tax on Building, Installations and Infrastructural Work. These are two of the main features of this paper.

AB  - The implementation of Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) is expected to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by providing actors with information that can be used to make better-informed decisions. This paper is the first to investigate EPCs in the Norwegian residential rental market. Applying the hedonic multilevel approach using information from some 440,000 rental contracts over the period of 2011–2018, we find that labeled dwellings have a premium compared with non-labeled dwellings, and that the premium is increasing with a higher EPC-label. We further define two classes of lessors – professional (real estate agents) and nonprofessionals (homeowners) – to study potential heterogeneity in EPC valuation and find that professionals assign higher rents compared with nonprofessionals. Dwellings with high energy efficiency are associated with a higher premium if rented out by a professional, a significant part of which stemming from higher EPC valuation. The results are robust to a number of heterogeneity analyses and after controlling for sample selection bias and unobserved locational heterogeneity. The findings of this paper signify the necessity to increase awareness and public dissemination regarding the EPC policy.

AB  - The UK Government has unveiled an ambitious retrofit programme that seeks significant improvement to the energy efficiency of the housing stock. High quality data on the energy efficiency of buildings and their related energy demand is critical to supporting and targeting investment in energy efficiency. Using existing home improvement programmes over the past 15 years, the UK Government has brought together data on energy efficiency retrofits in approximately 13 million homes into the Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), along with annual metered gas and electricity use for the period of 2004-2007. This paper describes the HEED sample and assesses its representativeness in terms of dwelling characteristics, the energy demand of different energy performance levels using linked gas and electricity meter data, along with an analysis of the impact retrofit measures has on energy demand. Energy savings are shown to be associated with the installation of loft and cavity insulation, and glazing and boiler replacement. The analysis illustrates this source of 'in-action' data can be used to provide empirical estimates of impacts of energy efficiency retrofit on energy demand and provides a source of empirical data from which to support the development of national housing energy efficiency retrofit policies.

AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: A Scholarly Tribute to the 50th Anniversary of the Western Regional Science AssociationAwareness of global warming and the extent of greenhouse gas emissions have focused more attention upon energy efficiency in building. Moreover, the inventory of "green" office space in the United States has increased dramatically since the introduction of rating schemes that attest to the energy efficiency or sustainability of commercial buildings. In some metropolitan areas, the supply of certified office buildings has more than doubled in the last decade, and there are a few metropolitan areas where "green" office space now accounts for more than a quarter of the total office stock. In this paper, we analyze the diffusion of buildings certified for energy efficiency across US property markets. Using a panel of 48 metropolitan areas observed over the last fifteen years, we trace the diffusion of green building practices across the country. We then model the geographic patterns and dynamics of building certification, relating industry composition, changes in economic conditions, characteristics of the local commercial property market, and the presence of human capital, to the cross-sectional variation in energy-efficient building technologies and the diffusion of those technologies over time. Understanding the determinants and the rate at which energy-efficient building practices diffuse over space and time is important for designing policies to affect resource consumption in the built environment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - We analyze whether lower rents for energy-inefficient apartments reflect tenants’ willingness to pay due to a higher green awareness, purchasing power, or energy consumption costs. Based on a German rental apartment dataset from Q1 2007 to Q1 2019, we use interaction terms for socioeconomic characteristics in a hedonic regression model. We find that rents are lower for apartments with higher energy consumption, even in neighborhoods with lower levels of green awareness. This relationship is stronger in neighborhoods with higher purchasing power, such that communities with low levels of green awareness and high purchasing power show the steepest negative slope for increasing energy consumption (−8.6% from the highest to lowest rating). Thus, the rent-decreasing effect of purchasing power is higher than that of green awareness. Splitting the entire period into smaller windows, we find that the interaction effect of green awareness has emerged in the most recent years (2017–2019). This may be driven by changes in regulation, which have made it easier for tenants to assess the energy consumption before they rent, or by a general increase in green awareness over this period.

AB  - We extend the commonly-studied definition of investment in sustainable and energy efficient real estate beyond environmental building certification to include three additional types of environmentally-focused building interventions: environmentally-focused capital expenditure (capex); monitoring; and, tenant engagement. Appealing to behavioral economics and finance theory, we test for a connection between changes in tenant and property management behavior and electricity consumption. Through a partnership with a global institutional investment manager, this study examines ten years of asset-level operating statement and electricity consumption data in Canadian and U.S. office buildings, measuring both the initial impact of such interventions as well as any adjustments observed over time. Analysis of the proprietary intervention data allows us to better understand the impact of varied environmental interventions on the electricity consumption of commercial real estate. We find that all four intervention categories, including building certification, are associated with decreased electricity consumption, with tenant engagement providing an immediate decrease that is maintained over time. Environmentally-focused capex is also associated with decreased electricity consumption in both Canada and the U.S. Taken together the results indicate that utility consumption and its associated costs are only minimized when multiple environmental interventions are implemented.

AB  - The South Korean government has been providing information on home energy efficiency since 2001 in order to incentivize improvements in the energy efficiency of both existing and new buildings. Whether such information provision delivers the intended outcomes hinges on consumers’ preferences for home energy efficiency in the real estate market. This study investigates South Korean consumers’ preferences for home energy efficiency in the real estate market by applying a choice experiment approach. Using a conditional logit model and a latent class model, this study concludes that less than 20% of Korean consumers consider home energy efficiency as a significant factor in their housing decisions and identifies the sources of taste variations in Korean consumers’ preferences for home energy efficiency. The findings of this study imply that the current information programs on home energy efficiency in South Korea should be much improved to achieve its goal.

AB  - Building is the "last mile" sector in carbon neutrality transition, and commercial buildings have the largest decarbonization potential using current strategies and technologies. This study focused on China and the United States (US) to assess carbon-dioxide (CO2) abatement in commercial building operations at different emission scales and investigate the carbon abatement efficiency of the two countries from 2001 to 2018. The results show that: (i) Economic efficiency and energy intensity are key to reducing CO2 intensity in Chinese and American commercial buildings, respectively; (ii) Generally, CO2 abatement efficiency in China was 1.1–1.9 times that of the US, although CO2 abatement in China and the US in 2001–2018 was close [China: 1451.89 (±549.05) mega-tons of CO2, US: 1929.84 (±757.36) mega-tons of CO2]; (iii) Ridge regression tested the robustness of CO2 abatement results of the assessment model successfully. Furthermore, the study mapped paths for energy efficiency improvement in commercial buildings in China and the US to explore the strategy that best decarbonizes buildings. Overall, this study covers the research gap on a carbon abatement assessment tool for different economies or regions to compare the historical carbon abatement features on building operation.

AB  - The consensus in the academic literature is that energy efficiency is associated with transaction value premiums, but it is not clear to what extent property appraisers take account of this. We decompose external appraisals of rental housing by international valuation firms in England and the Netherlands in two waves, keeping the samples of valued homes constant between these years. We find a notable change in the behavior of external property appraisers. In England, energy performance does not impact assessed values in 2012, while estimation results for 2015 show a significant discount in assessed values for D-, E- and F- relative to C-labeled dwellings. For the Netherlands, we do not observe a significant relationship between energy efficiency and assessed values in 2010, but in 2015 we find that more energy efficiency leads to higher external valuations.

AB  - Energy efficiency in the residential housing market can play an important role in the reduction of global carbon emissions. This paper reports the first evidence on the market adoption and economic implications of energy performance certificates implemented by the European Union. The results show that adoption rates are low and declining over time, coinciding with a negative sentiment regarding the label in the popular media. Labels are clustered among smaller, post-war homes in neighborhoods with more difficult selling conditions. We also document that geographic variation in the adoption rate of energy labels is positively related to the fraction of "green" voters during the 2006 national elections. Within the sample of labeled homes, the energy label creates transparency in the energy efficiency of dwellings. Our analysis shows that consumers capitalize this information into the price of their prospective homes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In recent years, formal certification programs for rating and evaluating the sustainability and energy efficiency of buildings have proliferated around the world. Developers recognize that such ''green labels'' differentiate products and allow them to charge a price premium. China has not formally adopted such rating standards. In the absence of such standards, developers are competing with each other based on their own self-reported indicators of their buildings' ''greenness''. We create an index using Google search to rank housing complexes in Beijing with respect to their ''marketing greenness'' and document that these ''green'' units sell for a price premium at the presale stage but they subsequently resell or rent for a price discount. An introduction of a standardized official certification program would help ''green'' demanders to acquire units that they desire and would accelerate the advance of China's nascent green real estate market.

AB  - Based on the recent emphasis on energy-efficient buildings in the United States, a high demand exists for architects, engineers, developers, builders, and clients to understand the context in which energy efficient design and construction influence the overall energy consumption and costs of a building. This paper describes a research project that focuses on a comprehensive analysis and documentation of an energy-efficient low-income / close to market rate housing development in Park City, Utah, USA. The project consists of 13 single-family residences that will mainly be constructed with Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs). The project will monitor and analyze building cost and construction efficacy of the energy efficient buildings and their components, and compare it to standard constructions in the Northern Utah Cold Climate Zone. The US Department of Energy DOE sponsors the research project as part of a strategy to transform the US housing market towards an energy-efficient, sustainable industry. Part of the strategy is to provide actors of that industry, which are mainly developers, contractors, and builders, with valuable knowledge on how to build energy-efficient houses. Despite comprehensive research in the field of energy-efficient buildings during the last two decades, most of the results have not reached the US architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) industries in the field of residential buildings yet. The paper will report on the project’s progress to analyze the specific building design, materials, components, and construction methods, to evaluate the strategies that will lead to a higher energy-efficiency compared to a traditional building. Obstacles and barriers that occur during the construction period will be comprehensively analyzed and compared to standard construction methods to better understand the resistance of the housing building industry towards new construction methods.

AB  - This paper studies the impact of energy efficiency on the unconditional distribution of residential property prices in Portugal. Using a dataset of more than 256,000 residential property sales from 2009 to 2013, a period that covers an economic depression, unconditional quantile regression analysis reveals that the responsiveness to energy efficiency improvements is different not only as we move from low- to high-priced residential units but also between apartments and houses. While apartments show a downward trend in the magnitude of energy efficiency coefficient estimates, the opposite occurs for houses. This last property type exhibits clear price discounts at the lowest quantiles of the price distribution, something that is not observable through conditional mean and quantile regression analysis. Our results suggest the existence of a different level of responsiveness to energy efficiency improvements in the Lisbon region when compared to the rest of the country and that the impact of the Energy Performance Certificate label increases throughout time across all price quantiles. As a by-product of this paper, an unconditional quantile price index shows how the impact of the crisis was not the same across different market segments, with more severe price decreases for low- than high-priced properties.

AB  - To address severe air pollution, the Chinese government plans to replace most residential coal stoves in northern China with clean heating devices by 2021. Coal stove replacement started in the "Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)" region and is expanding throughout northern China. Removing coal stoves reduces air pollutant emissions and hence is beneficial for both air quality and public health, as well as offering greenhouse gas mitigation co-benefits. However, there is little discussion of the economic costs of various clean heating technologies. In this study, we estimate total annual costs (TAC, annualized capital costs plus annual operating costs) for rural households, across cities/counties in the BTH region, to replace their coal stoves with several prevalent clean options-air-source heat pumps with fan coils (ASHPwF), electric resistance heaters with thermal storage (RHwTS), natural gas heaters (NGH), and clean coal briquettes with improved stoves (CCIS). We find: 1) Without subsidies, CCIS have the lowest TAC of all clean options. TAC of unsubsidized CCIS approximately doubles TAC of raw coal with improved stoves (RCIS), while unsubsidized electric/gas heaters cost 3–5 times more than RCIS. Thus, it is important for governments to financially support households' replacement of their coal stoves with clean heaters to facilitate widespread adoption. 2) With subsidies, CCIS have the lowest TAC in all regions except Beijing. In Beijing, generous subsides make ASHPwF-the most energy-efficient option-have the lowest TAC. In Tianjin, TAC of subsidized ASHPwF are slightly higher than CCIS and NGH. Throughout Hebei, except for a few severely cold northern counties where gas prices are high, subsidized NGH have lower TAC than ASHPwF and RHwTS. 3) Cost competitiveness of ASHPwF increases as heat demand increases, (e.g., higher desired indoor temperatures, larger home sizes, etc.) indicating that ASHP are good options for households with larger home sizes and commercial buildings. 4) Substantial potential exists to reduce heating expenses by improving building energy efficiency particularly in severely cold regions. 5) Cost advantages of NGH vary sharply with gas prices.

AB  - This paper considers the relationship between energy-efficient design and the leasing/sales markets for commercial real estate. An economic model is provided that considers lease rates and occupancy in simultaneous equilibrium. The behavior of both is predicted to be influenced by efficient design attributes. Selling price is determined by both rents and occupancy; therefore the impact of efficient design on commercial sales activity should be distributed through the leasing market. The model is tested empirically using a national sample of sales and leasing data for class A office buildings. The evidence indicates that "green" buildings achieve superior rents and sustain significantly higher occupancy. The improved performance in the rental market is reflected in a significant premium for the selling price of Energy Star-labeled and LEED-certified properties.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This paper investigates whether energy performance ratings, as measured by mandatory Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are reflected in the sale prices of residential properties. This is the first large-scale empirical study of this topic in England involving 333,095 dwellings sold at least twice in the period from 1995 to 2012. Applying hedonic regression and an augmented repeat sales regression, we find a positive relationship between the energy efficiency rating of a dwelling and the transaction price per square metre. The price effects of superior energy performance tend to be higher for terraced dwellings and flats compared to detached and semi-detached dwellings. The evidence is less clear-cut for rates of house price growth but remains supportive of a positive association. Overall, the results of this study suggest that energy efficiency labels have a measurable and significant impact on house prices in England.

AB  - The present study investigates the knowledge transfer (KT) processes from Norwegian University of Science and Technology to College ESLG in Kosovo. An inter-organisational knowledge of transfer theoretical framework from the business sector was applied to guide the present study. The data was generated through semi-structured interviews with key university officers, professors, and students in continuous education programmes from College ESLG and documentary evidence analysis from two partner universities. Based on the thematic analysis of the data, the findings demonstrated that the curriculum mapping process, joint lectures between Norwegian and Kosovar professors, joint research, and joint study visits facilitated the KT. While the transfer of knowledge most evidently resulted in institutional capacity development for the Kosovar College unit, the dissemination of knowledge to other units within the college was more challenging due to communication problems between the Real Estate Department and other units within the college.

AB  - New energy technologies present opportunities for low-carbon housing but also significant upfront costs for house owners. Due to the long service life of such technologies, market valuation impacts on the feasibility of such investments. Yet, existing evidence on the market valuation of energy investments in private housing is inconclusive. Furthermore, despite significant policy efforts, energy performance certificates remain ineffective. This paper addresses these gaps with a study of real estate agents and the use of market devices, such as tools, databases, classification schemes, inspection protocols and market practices. Our analytical framework builds on the sociology of markets, actor network theory and pragmatist theories of valuation in order to highlight the material and discursive assemblages and arrangements that intervene in the construction of markets. Drawing on empirical evidence from Finland, the results point to asymmetries in market devices and valuation practices that disfavour energy investments compared to the other key quality attributes of housing.

AB  - National domestic energy-efficiency policies are unlikely to be implemented in a geographically uniform manner. This paper demonstrates the importance of socioeconomic, contextual, and local policy conditions in shaping the spatially heterogeneous response to a national policy. Through an assessment of the geographical and temporal variation in domestic energy-efficiency assessments provided under the United Kingdom's Green Deal, the factors underpinning the spatial diffusion of this policy are identified. Spatial regression models show that the presence of young families, university educated residents, detached homes, and large households positively affects the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments whereas property market activity, personal incomes, the presence of self-employed residents, and the efficiency levels of the existing housing stock has a dampening effect. National incentives for policy implementation that are distributed through selected local authorities also work to promote the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments. Overall, the analysis clearly shows the importance of local factors in determining how national policies are implemented on the ground. This has important implications for policymakers in designing and administering national policy frameworks, in trading-off targeted implementation with fairness and uniformity, and in evaluating the local effectiveness of national policies.

AB  - A variety of green certifications is now available for residential housing in the United States. However, they have not been thoroughly investigated yet. The few existing studies have found positive valuation impacts for green-certified homes, mainly using the ENERGY STAR certification, relative to homes with no green certification. In this study, we utilize a sample comprised only of green-certified homes to test for differences in transaction outcomes across different types of green certifications. The results indicate that ENERGY STAR certified homes experience a significant price increase relative to other types of green certification, while EarthCraft certified homes do not. Given that the expected energy savings for EarthCraft certification and ENERGY STAR certification are almost identical, but EarthCraft requires additional green building standards to be met, these results are interpreted as evidence that home buyers are assigning value simply to the more recognizable program name rather than the potential cost savings (or other benefits) from program participation.

AB  - Despite significant progresses in development of energy-efficient buildings (EEBs), energy demand in building sector is still drastically increasing. This paradox is conceptualized in this study as Inefficiency of Increased Building Energy Efficiency. Marketability failure of EEBs and inefficiency in integrated design approach are the main causes of this paradox. Compared to merely focusing on the energy-efficiency enhancement, increasing the number of EEBs with a better marketability via enhancement of their aesthetic features is proposed as a novel approach for energy demand reduction in the building sector. This article aims to first investigate the current stage of EEBs’ adoption and the associated market barriers, and then to propose a multidisciplinary design approach to scrutinize the role of aesthetic features on buildings’ marketability for development of effective policies. Conducted comprehensive survey among real-estate agencies across 26 UK cities reveals a negative correlation between the energy-efficiency and housing marketability. Moreover, house price and aesthetic features are understood as the most dominant parameters that impact individuals' buying decision. Any extra initial cost of EEBs over 3% is likely to face market resistance. Furthermore, strong empirical evidences have been found to confirm that the proposed approach has a substantial potential to increase the EEBs’ number.

Using a panel of 48 metropolitan areas (MSAs) observed over the last 15 years, we model the geographic patterns and dynamics of building certification, relating industry composition, changes in economic conditions, characteristics of the local commercial property market, and the presence of human capital, to the cross-sectional variation in energy-efficient building technologies and the diffusion of those technologies over time. Understanding the determinants and the rate at which energy-efficient building practices diffuse is important for designing policies to affect resource consumption in the built environment.

AB  - Many different governments have begun to require disclosure of building energy performance, in order to allow owners and prospective buyers to incorporate this information into their investment decisions. These policies, known as disclosure or information policies, require owners to benchmark their buildings and sometimes conduct engineering audits. However, given substantial variation in the cost to disclose different types of information, it is natural to ask: how much and what kind of information about building energy performance should be disclosed, and for what purposes? To answer this question, this paper assembles and cleans a comprehensive panel dataset of New York City multifamily buildings, and analyzes its predictive power using a Bayesian multilevel regression model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals that building-level variation is the most important factor in explaining building energy use, and that there are few, if any, relationships of building systems to observed energy use. This indicates that disclosure laws requiring benchmarking data may be relatively more useful than engineering audits in explaining the observed energy performance of existing buildings. These results should inform the further development of information disclosure laws. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The number of multi-family housing complexes (MFHCs) over 15 yr old in South Korea is expected to exceed 5 million by 2015. Accordingly, the demand for energy retrofit in the deteriorating MFHCs is rapidly increasing. This study aimed to develop a decision support model for establishing the optimal energy retrofit strategy for existing MFHCs. It can provide clear criteria for establishing the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) and allow efficient budget allocation for conducting the energy retrofit. The CERT for "S" MFHC, one of MFHCs located in Seoul, as a case study, was set at 23.0% (electricity) and 27.9% (gas energy). In the economic and environmental assessment, it was determined that scenario #12 was the optimal scenario (ranked second with regard to NPV40 (net present value at year 40) and third with regard to SIR40 (saving to investment ratio at year 40). The proposed model could be useful for owners, construction managers, or policymakers in charge of establishing energy retrofit strategy for existing MFHCs. It could allow contractors in a competitive bidding process to rationally establish the CERT and select the optimal energy retrofit strategy. It can be also applied to any other country or sector in a global environment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Energy saving measures, if incorporated into existing and new buildings, can help the UK to achieve its ambitious goal to reduce carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. Yet, the penetration of such technologies has been slow in the commercial real estate market. This paper examines the attitudes and preferences of office end users and their acceptance of carbon emission reducing technologies. It employs conjoint analysis to model the real estate decision-making of 150 respondents who claimed to have an input into their organisation's choice of premises. The findings demonstrate that functionality and accessibility remain top priorities in occupiers' choice of premises. Lower rents, improved corporate image and productivity are revealed as attributes that could compensate occupiers for energy-efficient attributes that restrict control over internal environment and operation of equipment. The paper discusses instruments to promote greater acceptance and penetration of carbon emission reducing design features in the office market. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Rural buildings in China now account for more than half of China's total building energy use. Forty percent of the floorspace in China is in rural villages and towns. Most of these buildings are very energy inefficient, and may struggle to provide for basic needs. They are cold in the winter, and often experience indoor air pollution from fuel use. The Chinese government plans to adopt a voluntary building energy code, or design standard, for rural homes. The goal is to build on China's success with codes in urban areas to improve efficiency and comfort in rural homes. The Chinese government recognizes rural buildings represent a major opportunity for improving national building energy efficiency. The challenges of rural China are also greater than those of urban areas in many ways because of the limited local capacity and low income levels. The Chinese government wants to expand on new programs to subsidize energy efficiency improvements in rural homes to build capacity for larger-scale improvement. This article summarizes the trends and status of rural building energy use in China. It then provides an overview of the new rural building design standard, and describes options and issues to move forward with implementation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Buildings are responsible for approximately 36% of carbon emissions in the European Union. Besides, gradual aging and a lack of adaptability and flexibility of buildings often lead to destructive interventions, resulting not only in higher costs but also in a large amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). Recently, an innovative system (Ref. VEEP project) has been developed to recycle CDW for the manufacturing of energy‐efficient prefabricated concrete elements (PCE) for new building construction. By applying life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA), this study aimed to determine whether the use of VEEP PCE leads to lower carbon emission and lower associated costs over the life cycle of an exemplary four‐story residential building in the Netherlands than a business‐as‐usual (BAU) PCE scenario. This paper provides a case study on the alignment and/or integration of LCA and LCC in an independent and a combined manner (via monetization). This study examines how the internalization of carbon emission and discount rate will affect the final life cycle costs over a 40‐year life span. The simulation results show that the key to economic viability and environmental soundness of VEEP PCE is to reduce production cost and to optimize the thermal performance of the novel isolation material Aerogel; internalization of external cost monetarizes the environmental advantage thus slightly expands the cost advantage of low carbon options, but leads to larger uncertainty about the LCC result.

AB  - Inattention may be an important contributor to the energy efficiency gap and may be particularly acute in residential buildings where many different features will determine a home's energy use. Energy audits can provide information on how to reduce energy loss in a home, but the use of audits is rare. We use data from a national survey of 1700 homeowners to study the factors affecting a home owner's choice to have an audit. We create an index of energy inattention for our survey respondents. This index and two additional behavioral factors prove to be important determinants of the audit choice.

AB  - We used the data from a survey conducted in 2008 of 3,000 owners of detached houses to analyse the factors that influence the adoption of investment measures to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings. For the majority of Swedish homeowners, it was important to reduce their household energy use, and most of them undertook no-cost measures as compared to investment measures. Personal attributes such as income, education, age and contextual factors, including age of the house, thermal discomfort, past investment, and perceived energy cost, influence homeowners' preference for a particular type of energy efficiency measure. The implications for promoting the implementation of energy efficiency investment measures are discussed. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - Some states, including California, have already set targets for "net zero energy" new buildings, where efficiency and on-site generation are combined to reduce residential buildings to zero net energy use by 2020 and commercial buildings by 2030.9 The California Public Utilities Commission has also set the ambitious goal to reduce energy use in existing homes by 40 percent and install low-energy heating and cooling systems in 50 percent of new and existing homes by 2020.10 In addition, since 2002, the average nominal cost of electricity has risen more than 5 percent per year, and the average cost of natural gas has risen more than 10 percent a year for residential customers in the United States,11 driving up the need and demand for programs that bring down energy costs.  Other forms of financing are currently being used to fund energy-efficiency projects, such as on-bill financing, specialized unsecured bank loans for solar installations and energy-efficiency retrofits, mortgages designed to reward investments in energy efficiency, and traditional sources of funds such as home equity lines, second mortgages, and unsecured personal loans.

AB  - Retrofit actions applied to the existent building stock aim at increasing the energy performance, considering the optimal trade-off between energy savings and costs, according to the Directive 2010/31/EU. To select effective refurbishment measures and to quantify the energy saving potentials of the existent building stock, the analysis should be performed on "reference buildings". This article presents a methodology for the identification of reference buildings, according to the IEE-TABULA project (2009-12) aimed at creating a harmonised structure for "European Building Typologies". Among the possible applications of the building typology, this work focuses on the potentialities of energy savings and CO2 emission reductions for the European residential building stock. In particular, the Italian approach to model the energy balance of a subset of the national building stock is described; the results show the enormous potentialities of energy savings even with basic energy retrofit actions. Cost analyses were not in the scope of the project, but the results of this study are the basis for further investigations aimed at assessing the cost effectiveness of sets of measures. In this regard, the TABULA building-types are being applied by the Italian government for calculating cost-optimal levels of energy performance, complying with the Directive 2010/31/EU objectives.

AB  - In China, northern heating region contains approximately 6.5 billion m^sup 2^ residential building areas accounting for 15% of the total residential living areas of urban and rural. About 70% of the urban residential buildings in north China are high energy consumption buildings. The task of heat metering and energy efficiency retrofit of 0.15 billion m^sup 2^ existing residential buildings in northern heating areas of China in "the 11th Five-Year Plan" period was proposed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) in 2007 and completed in 2010. This paper introduced both central and local governments' efforts on organization, implementation and finance, etc. Then several retrofitting effects involving improving the people's livelihood, mobilizing the enthusiasm of residents for the retrofit and driving the development of relevant industries were presented. Finally, on the basis of analyzing the issues encountered in the progress of the retrofit in the past 4 years, the paper gave some policy proposals on organization system, financing models, reward mechanism, and heating system reformation to help to promote the energy efficiency retrofit in "the 12th Five-Year Plan" period.

AB  - The UK's housing stock generates approximately 27% of the country's total annual carbon emissions. In light of the legally binding targets to reduce carbon emissions, new housing is subject to a tightening of regulations governing energy demand and efficiency resulting in a gradual improvement in carbon emissions. The question is how to achieve the deep carbon emission reductions from existing domestic properties, of which 75% will still be in use in 2050. Government has sought to provide incentives to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their households, and mandate improvements in socially rented housing using a range of fiscal measures, most recently the 'Green Deal'. There has however been little consideration of the 18% of UK households who privately rent their home, a tenure that is growing fast. The aim of this research is to investigate the factors that influence private sector landlords when considering energy efficiency improvements to their tenanted homes. The results indicate that government policy has consistently failed to engage private sector landlords in the issue of energy efficiency and thus measures must be taken to understand the motivations of landlords in order to design effective incentives and interventions.

AB  - While many studies have shown that "green price premiums" accompany the development of green buildings, there is still significant doubt among the public as to the financial viability of investments in energy efficiency. In this paper, we examine this issue from the developers' perspective, and draw on data from Singapore's Green Mark (GM) system, which was introduced in 2005 to evaluate the sustainability and energy-efficiency of buildings. We find that the "green price premium" of residential developments arises largely during the resale phase, relative to the presale stage. The market premium of GM-rated units is about 10% at the resale stage, compared to about 4% during the presale stage. This implies that, while developers pay for almost all of the additional costs of energy efficiency during construction, they only share part of the benefits associated with such green investments. We also find no evidence that the development of green housing can immediately and significantly improve the corporate financial performance of Singaporean residential developers. These results provide the first evidence of the mismatch that developers face between outlays and benefits in the residential green building sector. This mismatch may impede further development of green residential properties. The emerging green real estate markets should be encouraged to introduce innovative business arrangements and financial products that allow residential developers to capture the future benefits associated with green properties.

AB  - U.S. housing accounted for over 22% of the country's total primary energy consumption in 2009, which equated to more than $2000 per household and $229 billion in aggregate expenditure. It appears that these amounts could be reduced substantially, with benefits to both household budgets and the environment's well-being. This paper's goal is to evaluate the alternative mechanisms that could expedite energy efficiency retrofits for U.S. housing. We begin by evaluating the evidence that significant improvements in the energy efficiency of existing U.S. housing are feasible, both technologically and financially. We compare the relatively optimistic positions taken in McKinsey and Company (2009a,b), EPRI (2009), and Harcourt, Brown, and Carey (2011) versus the less optimistic appraisal in Allcott and Greenstone (2012). We conclude that significant energy savings do appear to be both technologically and financially feasible. The remainder of the paper considers the bottlenecks that hamper energy-saving investments for the residential sector. We focus on imperfect information and loan market failures as the two key factors. We evaluate the state of the art with respect to scoring and assessment tools for energy-saving investments and the On-Bill, PACE, and Solar programs to facilitate secured loans. The discussion concludes with a series of proposals to overcome the bottlenecks.

AB  - This study computes the pure technical efficiency (PTE) and energy-saving target of Taiwan's service sectors during 2001-2008 by using the input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with the assumption of a variable returns-to-scale (VRS) situation. This paper further investigates the effects of industry characteristics on the energy-saving target by applying the four-stage DEA proposed by Fried et al. (1999). We also calculate the pre-adjusted and environment-adjusted total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores in these service sectors. There are three inputs (labor, capital stock, and energy consumption) and a single output (real GDP) in the DEA model. The most energy efficient service sector is finance, insurance and real estate, which has an average TFEE of 0.994 and an environment-adjusted TFEE (EATFEE) of 0.807. The study utilizes the panel-data, random-effects Tobit regression model with the energy-saving target (EST) as the dependent variable. Those service industries with a larger GDP output have greater excess use of energy. The capital-labor ratio has a significantly positive effect while the time trend variable has a significantly negative impact on the EST, suggesting that future new capital investment should also be accompanied with energy-saving technology in the service sectors.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of economic conditions and local attitudes on investors' decisions to opt for a green building certificate. The results indicate that green building certification is not only responsive to economic conditions but also to the attitudes of the local population. Areas with well-educated people and a political preference for the Democratic Party significantly and positively influence the decision to certify buildings. Higher education levels and Democratic partisanship are associated with the environmental orientation of the population. Hence, in these locations, the population's environmental concerns may play a key role.

AB  - Carbon emissions are considered as major factor affecting sustainable urban development. Cities have been promoting low carbon city (LCC) strategies to reduce carbon emissions and various methods have been introduced to assess the performance of LCC strategies. However, most of the existing assessment methods focus on overall LCC performance at city level, but the effects of individual dimensions like industrial structure and energy efficiency are ignored. The research question in this study therefore is whether an alternative method can be established to measure both the overall and dimensional LCC performance. This paper introduces a method for assessing LCC performance by using Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which is called LCC-CMM. The proposed method of LCC-CMM can help identify LCC maturity grade through assessing the performance of individual LCC dimensions which contributes to overall performance. There are four procedures in applying LCC-CMM, including to identify the Key Process Areas (KPAs) in the context of LCC, denoted as LCC-KPAs, to define the indicators for measuring the performance of LCC-KPAs, to calculate the performance score for each LCC-KPA, and to define criteria for specifying different grades of LCC capability maturity. The proposed method is proven effective through a case demonstration. The method can help policy makers to identify weak areas in LCC practice and introduce tailor-made policy measures to improve the weak areas.

AB  - The UK building stock has seen major changes in the last 50 years, in its form, fabric and function. The context is the expansion of the building stock and built infrastructure, which takes place in most areas at 1-2% per year, with the implication that up to 75% of the dwellings of the year 2050 already exist now. This is a major challenge. The energy performance of much of this stock is generally low, while its economic, social and cultural values are often high. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief outline of the state of knowledge of the existing building stock, and of potential advances in that knowledge. We follow a knowledge mapping approach, set out on several axes. The first is an axis from buildings as physical forms, to buildings as containers of socio-economic activity. Another axis spans between existing buildings, renovations and adaptations, and new buildings. A third axis is that of scale, from building components to large-scale settlements. There are many possible combinations of these parameters. Here we focus on those that are most relevant to the SEMBE goals of sustainable energy management across the whole building stock.

AB  - In this paper, we identify key drivers and barriers for the adoption of building energy retrofits in Germany, which is promoted by public policy as an important measure to address the future challenges of climate change and energy security. We analyze data from a 2009 survey of more than 400 owner-occupiers of single-family detached, semidetached, and row houses in Germany, that was conducted as a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). In the survey, respondents were asked directly for reasons for and against retrofitting their homes, but also faced a choice experiment involving different energy retrofit measures. Overall, we find that house owners who are able to afford it financially, for whom it is profitable, and for whom there is a favorable opportunity are more likely to undertake energy retrofit activities. The latter point seems to be of particular importance in explaining the persistent low retrofit rate in Germany. Our results suggest that professional energy advice could stimulate the demand for building energy retrofits. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Awareness of global warming and the extent of greenhouse gas emissions have focused more attention upon energy efficiency in building. Moreover, the inventory of "green" office space in the United States has increased dramatically since the introduction of rating schemes that attest to the energy efficiency or sustainability of commercial buildings. In some metropolitan areas, the supply of certified office buildings has more than doubled in the last decade, and there are a few metropolitan areas where "green" office space now accounts for more than a quarter of the total office stock. In this paper, we analyze the diffusion of buildings certified for energy efficiency across US property markets. Using a panel of 48 metropolitan areas observed over the last fifteen years, we trace the diffusion of green building practices across the country. We then model the geographic patterns and dynamics of building certification, relating industry composition, changes in economic conditions, characteristics of the local commercial property market, and the presence of human capital, to the cross-sectional variation in energy-efficient building technologies and the diffusion of those technologies over time. Understanding the determinants and the rate at which energy-efficient building practices diffuse over space and time is important for designing policies to affect resource consumption in the built environment.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to estimunate the impact of energy saving investment in residential and public buildings in Croatia for the period 2015-2020. The aim is to assess the overall socio-economic impact of energy saving renovation measures defined in Croatian strategic documents in terms of the direct, indirect and induced growth of gross value added, employment and government revenues. An estimate of the avoided costs of air pollution is also included. The overall economic impact assessment is based on an input-output methodology. From the point of view of individual investors, the benefits in terms of reduced future expenses related to energy products are usually below energy efficient renovation investment costs, making an investment financially viable only if government support is provided. If the benefits for society as a whole are included, energy efficient renovation could be assessed as viable even in the short-run. Energy saving retrofits of residential and public buildings positively contribute to economic growth, employment and protection of the environment. Because of economic growth, the tax revenues induced by these investments could compensate for government expenditures, and the overall impact on the public deficit is expected to be neutral even in the short-run.

AB  - Building energy efficiency rating systems have been established worldwide to systematically manage the energy consumption of existing buildings. This study aimed to develop a new energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings from two perspectives: (i) establishment of reasonable and fair criteria for the building energy efficiency rating system; and (ii) establishment of comparative incentive and penalty programs to encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign. Based on the analysis of the conventional energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings, this study was conducted in five steps: (i) data collection and analysis; (ii) correlation analysis between the household size and the CO2 emission density (i.e., CO2 emission per unit area); (iii) cluster formation based on results of the correlation analysis using a decision tree; (iv) establishment of a new energy efficiency rating system for existing buildings; and (v) establishment of incentive and penalty programs using advanced case-based reasoning. The proposed system can allow a policymaker to establish a reasonable and fair energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings and can encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign.

AB  - Switzerland boasts arguably the highest density of green properties in the world. In 2008, more than 15% of total new construction received the Swiss energy building label Minergie. The spatial distribution of these green buildings, however, is highly heterogeneous. In some regions, more than half of the new dwellings are built according to the Swiss green building standard. In others, this share is still negligible. The purpose of this paper is to identify the determinants of the distribution of green housing. For 2,571 Swiss municipalities, the author computes the green building share of new residential buildings. Data are collected for several variables measuring demographic, geographic, social, cultural, and political aspects that - according to the authors' hypothesis - may influence green building activity. Count regression is used to estimate the impact of these variables on the demand for green buildings. It is found that differences in income levels and cultural affiliation between Swiss municipalities account for the largest part of the variation in green building activity. The impact of homeowners' stance on environmentalism is highly significant but less important. Government subsidies do not seem to trigger additional green housing activity. The paper presents one of the first empirical analyses regarding the determinants of green building activity. Thanks to a comprehensive dataset, the authors are able to investigate the impact of potential drivers of "green housing" construction activity. The regional variation in governmental incentives is analysed and delivers valuable insight for policymakers interested in spurring the development of green buildings.

AB  - Turkey's energy demand has been growing by 4.5% per year over the last decade. As a reaction to this, the Turkish government has implemented the Strategic Energy Efficiency Plan (SEEP), which provides a guideline for energy efficiency policies in all sectors. The aim of this study is to analyse the potential of the SEEP on final energy demand in the Turkish residential sector until 2030. Three scenarios are developed based on a detailed bottom-up modelling approach using a vintage stock model to simulate the energy demand of heating systems and appliances. The results show a decreasing final energy demand in the reference scenario from about 944 PJ in 2008 to 843 PJ in 2030. This reflects a structural break, which is mainly caused by a high building demolition rate and low efficiency in the existing building stock. The SEEP achieves additional savings of around 111 PJ until 2030, while a scenario with even higher efficiency shows further savings of 91 PJ. Electricity demand increases in all scenarios -- mainly due to growing ownership rates of appliances. The SEEP will achieve around 10 TWh of electricity savings in 2030 compared to the reference scenario, mainly through more ambitious end-use standards.

AB  - The knowledge and enforcement problems faced by governments in defining traditional 'command and control' regulation are well known. Significant legal scholarship offers alternative models of 'smart,' 'responsive' environmental regulation, emphasising the need for policy instrument mixes, including the vital role of voluntary, industry-led sustainability standards. Yet, as is being increasingly recognised, these contributions leave open the need for detailed, qualitative evaluation of instrument mixes as a complement to primarily quantitative cost-benefit analyses that predominate in regulatory impact assessments by governments. Addressing this need, this paper evaluates policy and standards for low and zero carbon homes in England during the Coalition government (2010-2015) when the ecological modernisation discourse of the previous New Labour government became subsumed by a deregulation agenda. Our study, incorporating 70 stakeholder interviews, suggests that, in supplier-driven markets such as housing in England, a 'smart' mix of mandatory and voluntary standards requires a strong, central role for government in setting national, mandatory standards and supporting their delivery. There is an important potential supplementary role for voluntary tools and local authority discretion, though our study highlights problems that can arise when such different instruments promote diverging roadmaps towards a policy goal.

AB  - Built environment is responsible for 60% of total energy consumption in European countries and 128 million BOE of primary energy in Belgium. The average energy consumption in the residential buildings of Belgium is 70% higher than the EU average and stands at 348 kW h/m2/year. Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) provides guidelines for energy performance analysis of buildings in Belgium. In this study, a holistic approach has been adopted to analyse the building stock of Liege, Belgium. This analysis is based on 'General Socio-economic survey 2001' and 'Housing quality survey 2006 in Walloon region' databases. It considers parameters such as buildings age, built-up area, type of heating system, type of fuel used, adjacency, insulation of roofs and walls and energy consumption etc. for an in depth analysis. This study concludes that about 69% of buildings which are constructed before 1945 needs serious renovation towards the improvement of roof and external wall insulation level. It then successfully identifies specific areas which need detailed study to evaluate the comfort status in the existing building stock, improvement of insulation level and its effect on heating energy consumption as well as the economic analysis on energy efficiency measurements.

AB  - U.S. housing accounted for over 22% of the country's total primary energy consumption in 2009, which equated to more than $2000 per household and $229 billion in aggregate expenditure. It appears that these amounts could be reduced substantially, with benefits to both household budgets and the environment's well-being. This paper's goal is to evaluate the alternative mechanisms that could expedite energy efficiency retrofits for U.S. housing. We begin by evaluating the evidence that significant improvements in the energy efficiency of existing U.S. housing are feasible, both technologically and financially. We compare the relatively optimistic positions taken in McKinsey and Company (2009a,b), EPRI (2009), and Harcourt, Brown, and Carey (2011) versus the less optimistic appraisal in Allcott and Greenstone (2012). We conclude that significant energy savings do appear to be both technologically and financially feasible. The remainder of the paper considers the bottlenecks that hamper energy-saving investments for the residential sector. We focus on imperfect information and loan market failures as the two key factors. We evaluate the state of the art with respect to scoring and assessment tools for energy-saving investments and the On-Bill, PACE, and Solar programs to facilitate secured loans. The discussion concludes with a series of proposals to overcome the bottlenecks. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - This paper reviews the thermal performance of the existing UK housing stock, the main fabric efficiency incentive schemes and the barriers to obtaining deep energy and CO'2 savings throughout the stock. The UK faces a major challenge to improve the thermal performance of its existing housing stock. Millions of dwellings possess 'hard-to-treat' solid walls and have glazing which is not cost effective to improve. A range of fabric efficiency incentive schemes exist, but many do not target the full range of private and social housing. From now on, the Green Deal will be the UK's key energy efficiency policy. However, the scheme is forecasted to have low consumer appeal and low incentives for investors. Moreover, calculated Green Deal loan repayments will be reliant upon estimated energy savings, yet it is claimed that retrofit measures may only be half as effective as anticipated due to a lack of monitoring, poor quality installation and the increased use of heating following refurbishment. Looking to Germany, there has been success through the Passivhaus standard, but the UK currently lacks appropriate skills and cost effective components to replicate this approach. In addition, the embodied energy in retrofit products and materials threatens to counter operational savings. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - This study computes the pure technical efficiency (PTE) and energy-saving target of Taiwan's service sectors during 2001-2008 by using the input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with the assumption of a variable returns-to-scale (VRS) situation. This paper further investigates the effects of industry characteristics on the energy-saving target by applying the four-stage DEA proposed by Fried et al. (1999). We also calculate the pre-adjusted and environment-adjusted total-factor energy efficiency (TFEE) scores in these service sectors. There are three inputs (labor, capital stock, and energy consumption) and a single output (real GDP) in the DEA model. The most energy efficient service sector is finance, insurance and real estate, which has an average TFEE of 0.994 and an environment-adjusted TFEE (EATFEE) of 0.807. The study utilizes the panel-data, random-effects Tobit regression model with the energy-saving target (EST) as the dependent variable. Those service industries with a larger GDP output have greater excess use of energy. The capital-labor ratio has a significantly positive effect while the time trend variable has a significantly negative impact on the EST, suggesting that future new capital investment should also be accompanied with energy-saving technology in the service sectors.

AB  - Building energy efficiency standards (BEES) are believed to be one of the most effective policies to reduce building energy consumption, especially in the case of the rapid urbanization content in China. However, there is little evidence backed up by measured data to validate the actual effectiveness of BEES in China. Using survey data collected from 1128 households in Chongqing China, this study applied the propensity scores matching method to estimate the effect of two BEES levels: the 50%-BEES (low level) and the 65%-BEES (high level). Results show that buildings built with 65%-BEES, on average, can reduce cooling and heating electricity use intensity (kWh/m2/a) by 41%, compared to buildings in the absence of the BEES. Meanwhile, the adoption of 50%-BEES can reduce cooling and heating electricity use intensity (kWh/m2/a) by 38%. However, energy savings are not significant if comparing buildings with 65%-BEES and 50%-BEES. The results indicate that there exists a performance gap between calculated design performance savings and actual operation energy savings. These empirical findings provide policymakers with valuable feedback on buildings' actual performance. The findings suggest that it is necessary to incorporate outcome-based compliance pathways into the current BEES system. Lastly, a data-driven building policy evaluation mechanism should be developed in China. Energy consumption databases should be developed to support policies such as building energy codes and standards' development and performance evaluation.

AB  - There is a modest amount of research on the valuation impact of green housing features, but research on renovations or remodeling, which include green features called "green retrofits," cannot be found. The analysis in this paper uses consistent controls and methods to investigate the valuation implication of green retrofits on residential transaction prices. We find that renovated properties in the sample of residential transaction prices are sold at price levels 5.8% higher on average than properties that are not renovated, all else equal. However, green retrofits sell for 9.9% higher on average than non-renovated properties, and green retrofits sell for about 12.7% higher on average than non-green renovated properties. It appears that investment in residential green building features is capitalized in housing prices. We find that green retrofitted properties spend fewer days on the market compared to other transactions.

AB  - This paper provides a preliminary evaluation of staged introduction of the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards in England and Wales in the period after announcement but before policy implementation. A process evaluation of the specific policy design focussing on potential sources of policy failure is provided. Drawing upon a database of all EPCs registered for offices in London, preliminary empirical evidence is presented on policy outcomes post-announcement and pre-implementation period. The extent to which EPC G and F rated office buildings in London have improved their EPC rating in anticipation of the introduction of the policy between 2011 until 2017 is analysed. It is found that a maximum of 0.65% of the properties affected by the introduction of minimum standards had modifications that could have been triggered by the policy intervention in the period prior to policy implementation.

AB  - Axon et al., (2012) argue that maximizing the potential for energy efficiency and demand reduction in tenanted commercial properties requires a "building communities" approach. This paper develops and extends Axon et al.'s proposed framework in two ways. First, by extending its applicability from tenanted to owner-occupied properties. Second, by situating it within the literature related to organizational culture, occupant behaviours, and technology adoption. The paper begins with a brief review of the existing research on people, energy and commercial buildings. This literature tends to address either organizational choices, or occupant behavior, but it rarely crosses the analytical boundaries between these two groups. The paper then explores these different levels of analysis within a 3Cs -- "concern, capacity, and conditions" -- framework, which was developed to describe and distinguish organizational responses to an energy crisis. The combination of the "building communities" and 3Cs frames reveals gaps and grey areas between organizational culture, occupant behaviour, and technology adoption where further conservation opportunities may lie. These understudied areas suggest that there may be "social potential" for change that is between and beyond the frames used by previous research in the field. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Attention to 'sustainability' and energy efficiency rating schemes in the commercial property sector has increased rapidly during the past decade. In the UK, commercial properties have been certified under the BREEAM rating scheme since 1999, offering fertile ground to investigate the economic dynamics of 'green' certification in the commercial property market. This paper documents that, over the 2000-09 period, the expanding supply of green buildings within a given London neighbourhood had a positive impact on average rents and prices, but reduced rents and prices for environmentally certified real estate. The results suggest that there is a gentrification effect from green buildings. However, each additional "green" building decreases the marginal effect of certification in the rental and transaction markets by 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. In addition, controlling for lease contract features, like contract length and the rent-free period, modifies the impact of environmental certification on rental prices. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In Brazil the housing deficit is around 5.5 million houses. To address this need, the government created a programme called "My house, My life". The main subsidies of the programme are for families earning up to three times the minimum wage. In order to formulate strategies for more energy efficiency buildings, it is necessary to understand the thermal and energy performance of what is being built. This article defines representative projects for typologies being built in the Brazilian social housing sector through the analysis of 108 projects considering two groups of income levels and investigates the thermal and energy performance of the representative projects in relation to the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labelling of Residential Buildings in Brazil for two bioclimatic zones. Five representative building models were defined. Considering the most common features found on the sample, the study suggests the importance of addresing energy efficiency measures on the sector since current building techniques for social housing shows a tendency towards a low performance in relation to the thermal and energy performance criteria of the Energy Labelling especially for lower income projects. This provides a basis for future policy and allows for more in depth studies within the sector. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300859]

AB  - According to the recast of the Energy Performance Building Directive, Member States must give an exact definition for nearly zero-energy buildings to be introduced from 2018/2020. The requirement system stipulating the sustainable development of the building sector is usually based on the analysis of a few reference buildings, combining energy efficiency measures and HVAC systems. The risk of this method is that depending on the assumptions either the requirements do not provide sufficient incentives for energy saving measures and renewables or the requirements cannot be fulfilled with rational solutions in many cases. Our method is based on the artificial generation of a large building sample, where the buildings are defined by geometric and other parameters. Due to the large number of combinations, the effect of many variables appear in the results, with the deviations reflecting the sensitivity of the energy balance. The requirements are set based on some fundamental considerations and the statistical analysis of the sample. The method is demonstrated on the example of setting the requirements for residential buildings in Hungary. The proposed requirements are validated against the common European targets. The suggested method is suitable for developing building energy regulation threshold values, certification schemes or benchmarking values.

AB  - The adoption rate and stringency of building energy standards in the U.S. have been increasing since the mid-1990s as a result of the Energy Policy Act mandate of 1992 (EPAct). Current evidence on the energy savings that accrue from commercial building energy standards is based on engineering simulations, which do not account for realized behaviour once a standard is actually adopted. This paper uses quasi-experimental variation in commercial building energy standard adoptions to estimate their effect on realized electricity consumption and cost-effectiveness. In states induced by EPAct to adopt an energy standard where all new nonresidential construction was erected under a commercial standard, electricity consumption per service worker is lower by about 12%, and total commercial electricity consumption is lower by 10%. Including early adopters and never-adopters to the analysis leads to a downward bias in the treatment effect. The realized electricity savings in the EPAct states represent three quarters of predicted simulated savings, and electricity saved in 2010 came at a cost of approximately 7.7 cents per kWh.

AB  - While the concept of reflective roofing is not new to China, most Chinese cool roof research has taken place within the past decade. Some national and local Chinese building energy efficiency standards credit or recommend, but do not require, cool roofs or walls. EnergyPlus simulations of standard-compliant Chinese office and residential building prototypes in seven Chinese cities (Harbin, Changchun, Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou) showed that substituting an aged white roof (albedo 0.6) for an aged gray roof (albedo 0.2) yields positive annual load, energy, energy cost, CO2, NOx, and SO2 savings in all hot-summer cities (Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou). Measurements in an office building in Chongqing in August 2012 found that a white coating lowered roof surface temperature by about 20 °C, and reduced daily air conditioning energy use by about 9%. Measurements in a naturally ventilated factory in Guangdong Province in August 2011 showed that a white coating decreased roof surface temperature by about 17 °C, lowered room air temperature by 1-3 °C, and reduced daily roof heat flux by 66%. Simulation and experimental results suggest that cool roofs should be credited or prescribed in building energy efficiency standards for both hot summer/warm winter and hot summer/cold winter climates in China.

AB  - Energy consumption in the commercial property sector offers an important opportunity for conserving resources. In this study, we evaluate the financial implications of two elements of "sustainability" -- energy efficiency and accessibility -- in the market for commercial real estate. An empirical analysis of some 1100 leasing transactions in the Netherlands over the 2005-2010 period shows that buildings designated as inefficient (with an EU energy performance certificate D or worse) command rental levels that are some 6.5 percent lower as compared to energy efficient, but otherwise similar buildings (labeled A, B or C). Furthermore, this study shows that office buildings in multi-functional areas, with access to public transport and facilities, achieve rental premiums over mono-functional office districts. For policymakers, the results documented in this paper provide an indication on the effectiveness of the EU energy performance certificate as a market signal in the commercial property sector. The findings documented here are also relevant for investors in European office markets, as the importance of energy efficiency and locational diversification is bound to increase following stricter environmental regulation and changing tenant preferences.

AB  - This paper presents a two-fold evaluation method determining whether to renovate an existing building or to demolish it and thereafter erect a new building. The method determines a combination of energy saving measures that have been optimised in regards to the future cost for energy. Subsequently, the method evaluates the cost of undertaking the retrofit measures as compared to the cost of demolishing the existing building and thereafter erecting a new one. Several economically beneficial combinations of energy saving measures can be determined. All of them are a trade-off between investing in retrofit measures and buying renewable energy. The overall cost of the renovation considers the market value of the property, the investment in the renovation, the operational and maintenance costs. A multi-family building is used as an example to clearly illustrate the application of the method from macroeconomic and private financial perspectives. The example shows that the investment cost and future market value of the building are the dominant factors in deciding whether to renovate an existing building or to demolish it and thereafter erect a new building. Additionally, it is concluded in the example that multi-family buildings erected in the period 1850-1930 should be renovated.

AB  - In the U.S., where buildings account for 40% of energy use, commercial buildings use more energy per unit area than ever before. However, exemplary buildings demonstrate the feasibility of much better energy performance at no additional first cost. This research examines one possible explanation for this inconsistency. The aim is to investigate whether the anchoring bias, which refers to our tendency to gravitate towards a pre-defined standard regardless of its relevance, influences energy performance goals in building design. The scope examines professionals who help set energy performance goals for U.S. buildings. Prior to being asked to set an energy performance goal, these professionals were randomly directed to one of three series of questions. One series set an anchor of 90% energy reduction beyond standard practice, one set a 30% anchor, and one set no anchor. Respondents exposed to the 90% anchor, and respondents exposed to no anchor at all, set higher energy performance goals than respondents exposed to the 30% anchor. These results suggest that building rating systems that only reward incremental energy improvements may inadvertently create anchors, thereby discouraging more advanced energy performance goals and inhibiting energy performance that is technically and economically feasible.

AB  - A number of international jurisdictions have articulated a longer term goal of zero emission housing standards. However, in Australia, housing energy efficiency remains a contested policy area. In part, this is due to a lack of clear cost-benefit information on low emission housing standards, including impacts at the household level. This research investigated the lifetime economics of low emission housing options for typical housing in Melbourne, Australia. The analysis found that for a zero emission house, there was an additional capital cost of $25,637. This translated into extra yearly mortgage repayments of $2,117 at an interest rate of 7.89% across 25 years. However, energy efficiency cost savings of $1,547 a year were calculated, leaving a gap of $570/year in additional mortgage repayments. As a result, policy makers in Australia should focus on reducing upfront costs and developing innovative financial frameworks in order to make low emission housing achievable.

AB  - According to statistics and field investigation, the energy consumption situation and reality of commercial building are described in this paper. As the first step of large-scale public building energy efficiency supervision system encouraged by central government of China, the energy consumption of several typical commercial buildings and public buildings were analyzed in detail. The main contents of the investigation are basic information of building, operational record of energy consumption equipment, energy consumption of indoor equipments, energy-efficiency assessment of energy consumption systems and equipments, investigation of behavior energy saving, etc. On this basis, further analysis and diagnosis, including indoor thermal and humid environment, operation state of air-conditioning water system, operation state of air-conditioning duct system and operation management of air-conditioning system, were implemented. The results show that commercial buildings have the most energy consumption of buildings in this city, which can reach to about 240 W/m^2 per year. Further analysis tells that air conditioning systems play the major role of building energy consumption, and building energy saving has great potential in this city.

AB  - From the perspectives of the energy and the environment, building stock should be considered a useful resource in the struggle against greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy resources. The aim of this work is to provide an example of the application of a methodology to evaluate the energy needs of the building stock of a city and to determine the possible strategies for energy planning. This paper aims to obtain an estimate, on an urban scale, of the energy needs and CO2 emissions of the public residential buildings of Bari. This estimate is achieved by evaluating the critical issues of the built heritage, the most common architectural typologies and the heating systems in the territory of the city of Bari in southern Italy, as well as the possible strategies for upgrading energy efficiency, through the combined use of energy software and geo-referenced systems. Furthermore, several possible interventions are assumed to improve the energy performance of buildings in not only environmental terms but also economic terms through the instrument of cost-benefit analysis. The ultimate goal is to compare the different intervention strategies to determine which demonstrate greater cost effectiveness and feasibility for future energy planning.

AB  - Commercial building owners and managers often face the challenge of selecting the appropriate combination of voluntary and mandated programs for commercial building energy efficiency. Using a mixed-method, both quantitative and qualitative approach, this study finds that barriers to energy efficiency can be interpreted as strategic drivers for the emergence of five forms of voluntary and mandated program forms. We argue that the links between energy efficiency programs in commercial buildings should be conceptualized in a comprehensive manner by evaluating the strategic drivers that have ultimately led to the emergence of the principal forms of voluntary programs: economic incentives; certifications; alliances and partnerships; and internal company programs. We develop a conceptual framework that helps building owners and managers: identify the primary drivers for energy efficiency efforts; assess the efficacy and limitations of available program forms; apply each program form strategically in conjunction with a number of other program forms; and, ultimately, predict the emergence of new program forms. In addition to United States Department of Energy survey data, this study draws upon data collected through semi-structured interviews with experts at major U.S.-based corporations, federally funded laboratories, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations.

AB  - The European Union has relied upon information symmetry theory to foster decarbonization of existing buildings in cities under the hypothesis that efficient buildings receive a market premium. Hedonic analysis of housing prices across European cities suggests the existence of such a premium; while opinion-based research concludes that households pay scarce attention to energy performance when letting or buying a home. These approaches render inconclusive evidence regarding the role of energy-information symmetry as public policy in climate change mitigation through market prices. Since energy-efficiency attributes are contingent on the architectural quality of homes, poor control of the latter in hedonic models may bring biased conclusions regarding the former. The main contribution of this piece is to improve the control of these non-energy attributes using a visual inspection of listed apartments in Madrid and Barcelona. Results suggest that the energy-efficiency price premium completely disappears when other quality attributes are considered in full. This finding has large implications for energy and city policies.

AB  - The development towards more energy efficient buildings, as well as the expansion of district heating (DH) networks, is generally considered to reduce environmental impact. But the combined effect of these two progressions is more controversial. A reduced heat demand (HD) due to higher energy efficiency in buildings might hamper co-production of electricity and DH. In Sweden, co-produced electricity is normally considered to displace electricity from less efficient European condensing power plants. In this study, a potential HD reduction due to energy efficiency measures in the existing building stock in the Swedish city Linkoping is calculated. The impact of HD reduction on heat and electricity production in the Linkoping DH system is investigated by using the energy system optimisation model MODEST. Energy efficiency measures in buildings reduce seasonal HD variations. Model results show that HD reductions primarily decrease heat-only production. The electricity-to-heat output ratio for the system is increased for HD reductions up to 30%. Local and global CO"2 emissions are reduced. If co-produced electricity replaces electricity from coal-fired condensing power plants, a 20% HD reduction is optimal for decreasing global CO"2 emissions in the analysed DH system.

AB  - The built environment can be used to influence travel demand, but very few studies consider the relative energy savings of such policies in context of a complex urban system. This analysis quantifies the day-to-day and embodied energy consumption of four different neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, to examine how built environment variations influence various sources of urban energy consumption. A microsimulation combines models for petroleum use (from driving) and residential and commercial power and natural gas use with rigorously measured building stock and infrastructure materials quantities (to arrive at embodied energy). Results indicate that the more suburban neighborhoods, with mostly detached single-family homes, consume up to 320% more embodied energy, 150% more operational energy, and about 160% more total life-cycle energy (per capita) than a densely developed neighborhood with mostly low-rise-apartments and duplexes. Across all neighborhoods, operational energy use comprised 83 to 92% of total energy use, and transportation sources (including personal vehicles and transit, plus street, parking structure, and sidewalk infrastructure) made up 44 to 47% of the life-cycle energy demands tallied. Energy elasticity calculations across the neighborhoods suggest that increased population density and reduced residential unit size offer greatest life-cycle energy savings per capita, by reducing both operational demands from driving and home energy use, and from less embodied energy from construction. These results provide measurable metrics for comparing different neighborhood styles and develop a framework to anticipate energy-savings from changes in the built environment versus household energy efficiency.

AB  - China's building sector consumes one quarter of total energy consumption in the country and plays an important role in long-term ability of the country to achieve sustainable development. This paper discusses a comprehensive approach to achieving low carbon sustainability in large commercial buildings in China incorporating both energy and carbon-reduction strategies. The approach concentrates primarily on three complementary aspects: (a) the introduction of an effective energy management system; (b) the incorporation of relevant advanced energy saving technologies and measures and (c) the promotion of awareness among occupants to make changes in their behaviour towards a more environmental-friendly behaviour. However, reference is also made to the role that renewable energy and offsetting may have in the effective management and environmental performance of buildings. Nine examples of large commercial buildings in Beijing and Shanghai were studied and the average electricity consumption of around 153 kWh/m^sub 2^ per annum is about 5 times higher than average electricity use in residential buildings. At the same time the associated green house gas (GHG) emissions are around 158 kg/m^sub 2^ per annum. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In the context of rapid urbanization and new construction in rural China, residential building energy consumption has the potential to increase with the expected increase in demand. A process-based hybrid life-cycle assessment model is used to quantify the life-cycle energy use for both urban and rural residential buildings in China and determine the energy use characteristics of each life cycle phase. An input-output model for the pre-use phases is based on 2007 Chinese economic benchmark data. A process-based life-cycle assessment model for estimating the operation and demolition phases uses historical energy-intensity data. Results show that operation energy in both urban and rural residential buildings is dominant and varies from 75% to 86% of life cycle energy respectively. Gaps in living standards as well as differences in building structure and materials result in a life-cycle energy intensity of urban residential buildings that is 20% higher than that of rural residential buildings. The life-cycle energy of urban residential buildings is most sensitive to the reduction of operational energy intensity excluding heating energy which depends on both the occupants' energy-saving behavior as well as the performance of the building itself.

AB  - Turkey's energy demand has been growing by 4.5% per year over the last decade. As a reaction to this, the Turkish government has implemented the Strategic Energy Efficiency Plan (SEEP), which provides a guideline for energy efficiency policies in all sectors. The aim of this study is to analyse the potential of the SEEP on final energy demand in the Turkish residential sector until 2030. Three scenarios are developed based on a detailed bottom-up modelling approach using a vintage stock model to simulate the energy demand of heating systems and appliances. The results show a decreasing final energy demand in the reference scenario from about 944 PJ in 2008 to 843 PJ in 2030. This reflects a structural break, which is mainly caused by a high building demolition rate and low efficiency in the existing building stock. The SEEP achieves additional savings of around 111 PJ until 2030, while a scenario with even higher efficiency shows further savings of 91 PJ. Electricity demand increases in all scenarios -- mainly due to growing ownership rates of appliances. The SEEP will achieve around 10 TWh of electricity savings in 2030 compared to the reference scenario, mainly through more ambitious end-use standards. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - Demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics influence variation in household energy consumption. By combining household-level utility, public, and proprietary data, we examine predictors of household energy consumption in a Texas urban area. Using quantile regression, this analysis assesses the relationship between energy consumption and predictors at the middle and both ends of the distribution (10th and 90th percentiles). Results indicate potential opportunities to lower consumption among the highest energy-consuming households including those with pools, with non-central cooling, with people working from home, those built on pier/post foundation, and those that are renter-occupied. These findings suggest significant opportunities to reduce consumption and demand as in the study area, almost 10% of housing units are renter-occupied, 18% percent are without central cooling, and 7% have pools. Capturing a significant portion of these homes for retrofit conservation efforts through marketing has potential to produce substantial results. Producing a better understanding of determinants of household energy consumption using the methods presented has potential to assist development and implementation of strategies to reduce consumption and increase efficiency.

AB  - With rapidly increasing energy consumption attributed to residential buildings in South Korea, there is a need to update requirements of the building energy code in order to improve the energy performance of buildings. This paper provides some guidelines to improve the building energy code to better select glazing types that minimize total energy use of residential buildings in Korea. In particular, detailed energy simulation analyses coupled with economical and environmental assessments are carried out to assess the thermal, economical, and environmental impacts of glazing thermal characteristics as well as window sizes associated with housing units in various representative climates within South Korea. The results of the analyses have clearly indicated that selecting glazing with low solar heat gain coefficient is highly beneficial especially for large windows and for mild climates. In particular, it is found that using any double-pane low-e glazing would provide better performance for windows in residential buildings than the clear double-pane glazing, currently required by the Korean building energy code.

AB  - This article focuses on the impact of the discount rate on cost-benefit assessment of investment options for residential building efficiency. An integrated thermal modeling, life cycle costing approach is applied to an extensive sample of dominant house designs for Australian conditions. The relative significance of predicted thermal performance and the applied discount rate on the Present Value of energy savings from alternative investment scenarios is investigated. Costs and benefits are also evaluated at the economy-wide scale, including carbon pricing considerations, and for a test-case household faced with alternative investment options at the point of construction. The influence of the applied discount rate on produced cost-benefit calculations is investigated, as is the interaction between critical cost-benefit input parameters. Findings support that the discounting framework is the primary driver of difference in estimates about costs and benefits of higher standards of efficiency in the residential sector. Results demonstrate that agreement on a low discount rate based on sustainability principals would prioritise those projects with significant environmental benefits. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The significance of bioclimatic architecture has become widely accepted since the 1970s and the implementation of its principles in practice is a key factor in order to achieve energy efficiency in the building sector. The way, however, from scientific acceptance to commercial utilization is not a straightforward one. This paper deals with the notion of bioclimatic architecture in buildings and investigates the aspects of this concept in Hellas. A sample of university researchers, building contractors and members of public organisations was interviewed using a standardised set of guidelines. The barriers to promoting bioclimatic design, role of the local government in the adoption process, level of environmental culture as well as perspectives of this concept in Hellas were the key areas of discussion in each of the interviews. The results from the data analysis reveal insufficient economic incentives, a lack in technical information as well as a lack in specific environmental policies that would foster the propagation of bioclimatic architecture.

AB  - Soaring building heating energy consumption (BHEC), along with rising income, is threatening carbon abatement efforts. However, the influencing mechanism of income on BHEC remains unclear. This study establishes a theoretical model of the impact of income on BHEC from three perspectives: building physical characteristics, building use characteristics and energy-consuming equipment characteristics. Then, we adopt a stepwise hierarchical regression method to examine the direct and intermediary effects between income and BHEC using microdata from 662 households in Chongqing, China. The results show that household income, residential building floor space, the amount of heating equipment, building energy efficiency standards, and the heating method significantly impact BHEC. Moreover, the direct effect of income on BHEC is up to 84%. The amount of heating equipment and residential building floor space are both strong intermediaries between income and BHEC, contributing 18.8% and 15.8%, respectively. The heating method is a weak intermediary, only contributing approximately 1% of the impact. Overall, this study can promote the development of the related theory of BHEC and provide a reference for the government to implement more effective energy-efficient policies on the local scale and even on the national and global scales.

AB  - Realising energy efficiency opportunities in new commercial office buildings is an easier task than retrofitting older, mid-tier building stock. As a result, a number of government programs aim to support retrofits by offering grants, upgrades, and energy audits to facilitate energy efficiency opportunities. This study reports on a state government program in Victoria, Australia, where the uptake of such offerings was lower than expected, prompting the program team to consider whether targeting facilities managers (FMs), rather than building owners, might be a better way of delivering the program. The influences and practices of FMs that impact on their ability to be advocates for energy efficiency were explored. The results revealed that complex building ownership arrangements, poor communication skills, isolation from key decision making processes, a lack of credible business cases and information, split incentives, and the prospect of business disruptions can all impact on FMs' ability to drive organizational change. Future program efforts should continue to interrogate the social context of retrofits in mid-tier buildings, including other influences and influencers beyond FMs, and adapt accordingly.

AB  - Several aspects of energy conservation in nonmetropolitan rental housing are examined, with a focus on landlords.  Data collected through a survey of rental housing owners in 4 nonmetropolitan counties of New York State are analyzed.  Landlord behavior and perceptions differ according to their scale of operation and, to some extent, their profit motivations.  Accordingly, landlords are likely to respond to programmatic initiatives if such initiatives are targeted to landlords on the basis of these differences.  Significant differences in policy preferences, the use of investment criteria, and the application of energy conservation measures in their rental properties were observed between small- and large-scale landlords.  While Suchy and VonZuckerstein (1982) recommended that rental housing energy conservation programs could effectively be designed by tailoring landlord incentives based on their profit motivations, results from this study indicate that such a classification strategy may not be as useful as would be one based on the scale of an owner's rental property operations.

AB  - Residents of Interior Alaska are faced with a cold climate and relatively high energy prices, which results in high home energy expenditures. Increasing the energy efficiency of the housing stock can help reduce household energy expenditures. Following a spike in oil prices in 2008, legislation was passed, which created the Home Energy Rebate Program. Homeowners participating in the program were eligible to receive up to a $10,000 rebate for preapproved home energy efficiency improvements. This paper examines the effect of the Home Energy Rebate program on the selling prices of single-family residences in the Fairbanks North Star Borough from 2008 through 2015 using a hedonic pricing analysis. The results show that homes that completed the Home Energy Rebate program in the Fairbanks North Star Borough sell for a 15.1–16.5% price premium over similar homes that did not complete the program, which indicates that investments in residential energy efficiency are compensated. This is the first study to examine the impact of energy efficiency on house prices in a market with a subarctic climate.

AB  - The energy required for space heating has been significantly reduced in recent decades by making use of insulation and more efficient heating and ventilation systems. Even so, wide variations in energy consumption are still observed between similar dwellings and between actual and predicted levels. It is thought that these variations stem from differences in occupant behaviour, the structural quality of the building, and a rebound effect. This paper statistically examines differences in occupant behaviour in relation to the building characteristics of the housing stock in the Netherlands and explores the possible existence of a rebound effect on the consumption of energy for space heating. Rebound effect can be defined as the increase on energy consumption in services for which improvements in energy efficiency reduce the costs. We found that although energy consumption is lower in energy efficient dwellings, analysis of the behaviour variables indicates their occupants tend to prefer higher indoor temperatures and to ventilate less. This finding might be related to a rebound effect on occupant behaviour. However, the improvement of thermal properties and systems efficiency still lead to a reduction on energy consumption for heating.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The Directive 2002/91/CE introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC), an energy policy tool. The aim of the EPC is to inform building buyers about the energy performance and energy costs of buildings. The EPCs represent a specific energy policy tool to orient the building sector and real-estate markets toward higher energy efficiency buildings. The effectiveness of the EPC depends on two factors: the accuracy of energy performance evaluation made by independent experts, and the capability of the energy classification and of the scale of energy performance to control the energy index fluctuations. In this paper, the results of a case study located in Italy are shown. In this example, 162 independent technicians on energy performance of building evaluation have studied the same building. The results reveal which part of confidence intervals is dependent on software misunderstanding and that the energy classification ranges are able to tolerate the fluctuation of energy indices. The example was chosen in accordance with the legislation of the Emilia-Romagna Region on Energy Efficiency of Buildings. Following these results, some thermo-economic evaluation related to building and energy labelling are illustrated, as the EPC, which is an energy policy tool for the real-estate market and building sector to find a way to build or retrofit an energy efficiency building.

AB  - The growing energy consumption in the residential sector represents about 30% of global demand. This calls for Demand Side Management solutions propelling change in behaviors of end consumers, with the aim to reduce overall consumption as well as shift it to periods in which demand is lower and where the cost of generating energy is lower. Demand Side Management solutions require detailed knowledge about the patterns of energy consumption. The profile of electricity demand in the residential sector is highly correlated with the time of active occupancy of the dwellings; therefore in this study the occupancy patterns in Spanish properties was determined using the 2009-2010 Time Use Survey (TUS), conducted by the National Statistical Institute of Spain. The survey identifies three peaks in active occupancy, which coincide with morning, noon and evening. This information has been used to input into a stochastic model which generates active occupancy profiles of dwellings, with the aim to simulate domestic electricity consumption. TUS data were also used to identify which appliance-related activities could be considered for Demand Side Management solutions during the three peaks of occupancy. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This paper investigates whether obtaining sustainable building certification entails a rental premium for commercial office buildings and tracks its development over time. To this aim, both a difference-in-differences and a fixed-effects model approach are applied to a large panel dataset of office buildings in the United States in the 2000-2010 period. The results indicate a significant rental premium for both ENERGY STAR and LEED certified buildings. Controlling for confounding factors, this premium is shown to have increased steadily from 2006 to 2008, followed by a moderate decline in the subsequent periods. The results also show a significant positive relationship between ENERGY STAR labeling and building occupancy rates. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Identifying free-ridership is significant to several issues relevant to program evaluation, including the calculation of net program benefits and assessments of political acceptability. Despite the potential of free-ridership to seriously undermine the economic efficiency of a program intervention, for instance to foster energy efficiency, the issue remains largely absent from contemporary environmental and energy policy discussions in Europe. One reason for this neglect is the inherent difficulty of assessing which households would have undertaken the energy conservation activity even without the program. This paper proposes a procedure to calculate the free-rider share using revealed preference data on home renovations from Germany's residential sector. We employ a discrete-choice model to analyze the effect of grants on renovation choices, the output from which is used to assess the extent of free-ridership under a subsidy program very akin to an implemented grants program in Germany. Our empirical results suggest only very moderate energy savings induced by the program, making free-riding a problem of outstanding importance. [PUB ABSTRACT]

AB  - Built environment is responsible for 60% of total energy consumption in European countries and 128 million BOE of primary energy in Belgium. The average energy consumption in the residential buildings of Belgium is 70% higher than the EU average and stands at 348 kW h/m2/year. Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) provides guidelines for energy performance analysis of buildings in Belgium. In this study, a holistic approach has been adopted to analyse the building stock of Liege, Belgium. This analysis is based on 'General Socio-economic survey 2001' and 'Housing quality survey 2006 in Walloon region' databases. It considers parameters such as buildings age, built-up area, type of heating system, type of fuel used, adjacency, insulation of roofs and walls and energy consumption etc. for an in depth analysis. This study concludes that about 69% of buildings which are constructed before 1945 needs serious renovation towards the improvement of roof and external wall insulation level. It then successfully identifies specific areas which need detailed study to evaluate the comfort status in the existing building stock, improvement of insulation level and its effect on heating energy consumption as well as the economic analysis on energy efficiency measurements.

AB  - Organizational interventions (OIs) and employees' psychological factors have a substantial effect on employees' energy-saving behaviors. However, existing studies have not considered the psychological mechanisms underlying the linkage between interventions and behaviors. To fill this gap, we explored the effect of OIs on employees' psychological factors and that of employees' psychological factors on their intentions to save energy. In doing so, we incorporated OIs in the theory of planned behavior model, and included employees' energy-saving knowledge and educational level as moderators. We found that (1) OIs improved employees' energy-saving attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, and they strengthened employees' intention to engage in energy-saving behaviors; (2) conveying expectations regarding energy-saving behaviors to employees worked better than emphasizing the importance of such behaviors; (3) increasing employees' knowledge of energy consumption may have strengthened the positive effect of OIs on employees' attitudes and perceived behavioral control in this context; and (4) the positive effect of OIs on the perceived behavioral control of employees with high and low educational level was greater than that on those with moderate educational level. These findings can help decision makers in companies to understand employees' energy-saving behaviors better and to formulate more effective energy-efficient policies.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, house building standards across the western world have begun to address ecologically sustainable development (ESD) principles. Amongst the range of environmental sustainability issues arising from housing construction and occupation, the energy demand for heating and/or cooling to maintain thermal comfort has the longest history and is most widespread in policy and regulation. Since energy in our homes is mainly fossil-derived, a key issue is global climate change impacts. Since greenhouse gas emissions can be emitted in various locations across the globe with similar results, it follows that a given greenhouse gas emission arising from residential space heating and cooling has approximately equal impact, irrespective of the location of the building. These emissions are therefore an appropriate candidate for benchmarking internationally, yet there have been few attempts to undertake this activity. This paper reports on a study undertaken in Australia which compares the thermal energy performance of housing in the United States, Canada, UK and Australia. The comparison is based on energy ratings of over 50 house designs from the comparison countries. Each design was assessed as being current and verified as complying with rather than significantly exceeding local regulatory requirements. Issues in design of both the buildings and the modelling tool used are highlighted, and the results are presented. Conclusions are drawn on the reasons for wide variations in thermal energy performance, the implications for benchmarking, and the case for globally consistent housing environmental performance policies and regulation.

AB  - This paper uses a random utility model to estimate consumers' valuation of energy efficient insulation and ventilation systems in rental apartments. Given consumers' limited experience in residential buildings and the perceived uncertainty about their comfort benefits and resulting energy savings, these relatively new technologies might be undervalued by risk-averse consumers. Using the concept of certainty-equivalence, this paper proposes a model to assess the consumers' risk-aversion for adopting energy-efficient systems. These systems are treated as risky assets while conventional commodities are assumed to be risk-free. The curvature of the utility function is interpreted as a measure of aversion to perceived risks as opposed to explicit risks measured by observed variances. The proposed formulation is applicable in stated preference data with qualitative variables. The model is applied to data from a choice experiment conducted among 264 apartment tenants in Switzerland. The estimated curvatures reject the risk-neutrality hypothesis. The range of the estimated risk premiums suggests that risk considerations remain a central issue in dealing with energy efficiency in residential buildings. The analysis also indicates that assuming same risk attitudes toward new and conventional systems could bias the estimates of the willingness to pay, especially when the system is comprised of several components.

AB  - In 2010, the federal Australian government mandated the disclosure of energy performance ratings in advertisements for sale or lease of large commercial office properties. Prior to 2010, participation in the rating scheme was voluntary. This study first develops a theoretical model of mandatory disclosure policy effectiveness. Then, with a dataset of all ratings since inception of the voluntary regime in 1999, it tests the expectation that initial voluntary adopters have a greater tendency towards environmental stewardship and are more likely to manage and invest in environmental performance improvements, potentially dampening the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure policy. However, multiple statistical models of certification are unable to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in energy efficiency outcomes between the mandatory and voluntary adopters at equivalent stages. For urban policymakers, the extrapolation of voluntary adopter performance appears to be a good -- perhaps even conservative -- estimation of mandatory energy performance disclosure outcomes.

AB  - Energy use in residential buildings accounted for 21% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2013. Efforts to reduce energy use in the residential sector have been overly focused on improving energy efficiency of buildings. This article incorporates housing policy debate into energy policy, hoping to provide new opportunities for planners to participate in residential energy policy. Using data from the latest Residential Energy Consumption Survey, structural equation modeling has been applied to isolate the direct and indirect effects of household and housing characteristics on residential energy use. Results show that more than 80% of a household's indirect effect on energy consumption happens through the building characteristics, which is characterized as the housing choice effect on energy consumption. Planners can participate in residential energy management efforts by influencing housing needs and priorities of communities towards more sustainable compact housing units.

AB  - We investigate the relationship between building energy efficiency and the probability of mortgage default. To this end, we construct a novel panel data set by combining Dutch loan-level mortgage information with provisional building energy ratings provided by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency. Using the logit regression and the extended Cox model, we find that building energy efficiency is associated with a lower probability of mortgage default. There are three possible channels that might drive the results: (i) personal borrower characteristics captured by the choice of an energy-efficient building, (ii) improvements in building performance that could help to free-up the borrower’s disposable income, and (iii) improvements in dwelling value that lower the loan-to-value ratio. We address all three channels. In particular, we find that the default rate is lower for borrowers with less disposable income. The results hold for a battery of robustness checks. This suggests that the energy efficiency ratings complement borrowers’ credit information and that a lender using information from both sources can make superior lending decisions than a lender using only traditional credit information. These aspects are not only crucial for shaping future energy policy, but also have implications for the risk management of European financial institutions.

AB  - Rural buildings in China now account for more than half of China's total building energy use. Forty percent of the floorspace in China is in rural villages and towns. Most of these buildings are very energy inefficient, and may struggle to provide for basic needs. They are cold in the winter, and often experience indoor air pollution from fuel use. The Chinese government plans to adopt a voluntary building energy code, or design standard, for rural homes. The goal is to build on China's success with codes in urban areas to improve efficiency and comfort in rural homes. The Chinese government recognizes rural buildings represent a major opportunity for improving national building energy efficiency. The challenges of rural China are also greater than those of urban areas in many ways because of the limited local capacity and low income levels. The Chinese government wants to expand on new programs to subsidize energy efficiency improvements in rural homes to build capacity for larger-scale improvement. This article summarizes the trends and status of rural building energy use in China. It then provides an overview of the new rural building design standard, and describes options and issues to move forward with implementation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - Currently there is a strong policy commitment in European Union (EU) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries to increase the energy efficiency of residential buildings, and it is widely assumed that this will naturally and automatically reduce domestic energy consumption. However, other factors such as fuel prices, wages, attitudes and lifestyles also influence energy consumption. This paper calculates broad-brush rebound effects based on changes in energy efficiency and energy consumption in each of the 28 EU countries plus Norway, for the years 2000-2011. In doing so, it tests how well the assumption of energy efficiency leading to energy reduction stands up to scrutiny in these lands. It uses the EU's Odyssee database for efficiency and consumption figures and a commonly employed econometric definition of the rebound effect as an energy-efficiency elasticity. Most older EU lands show rebound effects in the expected range of 0-50%. However, the range for newer EU countries is 100-550%, suggesting that energy efficiency increases are not a good predictor of energy consumption. A more in-depth look at one country, Germany, suggests these results underestimate the rebound effect significantly. This also identifies research needs for specific energy consumption determinants in each country, to find more precisely what is driving consumption levels.

AB  - We analyze the economics of green building, finding that recent increases in the supply of green buildings and the volatility in property markets have not affected the returns to green buildings. We then analyze a large cross-section of office buildings, demonstrating that economic returns to energy-efficient buildings are substantial. Finally, we relate the economic premiums for green buildings to their relative efficiency in energy use -- the attributes rated for thermal efficiency, as well as sustainability, contribute to premiums in rents and asset values. Among green buildings, increased energy efficiency is fully capitalized into rents and asset values. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The worldwide issue of high housing prices has significantly affected the general population’s inhabitation right and their willingness to purchase homes. The governments of all countries have been actively promoting public housing policies to help satisfy daily living requirements for all social classes. However, many differences exist in the design requirements for public housing and typical housing design, and the lack of discussion on these differences has caused design outcomes to often fail in meeting users’ requirements. This study first adopts the Kano two-dimensional quality analysis method in an attempt to define the real needs of public housing users; subsequently, based on the quality function deployment method, it transforms the design requirements into a design strategy. The research findings indicate that future public housing must focus on multi-generational living arrangements, energy-efficient and barrier-free designs, flexible spaces, crime prevention, self-sufficient farming, and other such areas to satisfy the needs of different users. This study practically bases its case designs on a design strategy and obtained feedback from users to understand the expectations and cognitive differences between designers and residents.

AB  - There is considerable scope for energy efficiency improvements to the housing stock in the Netherlands. Although, economically, there are many technological opportunities available, the Dutch built environment has difficulty to harvest this potential. This paper applies a sectoral innovation system approach to investigate this apparent paradox. This approach allows to identify and assess systemic barriers that prevent improvement in overall energy efficiency of the Dutch housing sector. Twenty-one experts were interviewed, and a qualitative data analysis was applied to identify barriers, and relate them to key dimensions in the sectoral innovation system framework. From this analysis, we identified poor regulatory design, lack of market demand, and some institutional characteristics of the construction sector as the key systemic barriers that hamper the diffusion of green energy innovations in the Dutch housing sector.

AB  - The IEA has estimated that over the next four decades US$31 trillion will be required to promote energy efficiency in buildings. However, the opportunities to make such investments are often constrained, particularly in contexts of austerity. We consider the potential of revolving funds as an innovative financing mechanism that could reduce investment requirements and enhance investment impacts by recovering and reinvesting some of the savings generated by early investments. Such funds have been created in various contexts, but there has never been a formal academic evaluation of their potential to contribute to low carbon transitions. To address this, we propose a generic revolving fund model and apply it using data on the costs and benefits of domestic sector retrofit in the UK. We find that a revolving fund could reduce the costs of domestic sector retrofit in the UK by 26%, or L9 billion, whilst also making such a scheme cost-neutral, albeit with significant up-front investments that would only pay for themselves over an extended period of time. We conclude that revolving funds could enable countries with limited resources to invest more heavily and more effectively in low carbon development, even in contexts of austerity.

AB  - Government-led interorganizational alliance networks present a sensible opportunity to overcome many societal challenges through collaborative governance. In particular, few researchers have studied alliance networks in the field of energy conservation in commercial buildings -- a sector with unique barriers to greater diffusion of innovative cost-saving strategies. We applied an analytic inductive case-based method and social network analysis to study one particular alliance network: the United States Commercial Building Energy Alliances representing interests from retail, commercial real estate, and healthcare sectors. This alliance network was initiated by the United States Department of Energy, with assistance from several federally funded research laboratories in the United States, to promote the diffusion of knowledge and ultimately encourage greater deployment of energy efficiency and clean energy strategies in commercial buildings. We draw upon interview data from 28 cases of private, non-profit, and governmental organizations and complete network data from the alliance participants. We honed in on eight focal cases of governmental organizations to provide insight on how the four forms of energy and environmental data, information, and knowledge shared within an alliance network address the challenge of a vastly underutilized energy resource, namely conservation. Further, we identify and discuss the public's four roles -- Commissioner, Interpreter, Marketer, and User -- in providing balance to the diffusion of both private and public goods in a network.

AB  - The building sector is responsible for a major share of energy consumption, with the most energy being consumed during the operation stage of buildings. Energy-efficiency retrofit (EER) policies have been promoted by numerous countries. However, the effectiveness of these incentive policies has been insufficient, a main reason being the agency problem between the government and building owners. In addition, most policies ignored the diversity of buildings and building owners, resulting in a lack of reaction from owners. To address this problem, this study proposed an agent-based model for policy making on EER. The model defined the government and owners as agents and their decision-making behaviors were modeled with principal-agent theory. A platform based on the proposed model was then developed and the incentive policy was optimized under different circumstances. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, three policy scenarios were compared on the platform, which are the policy by the proposed model, the incentive policy in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. The results showed that the incentive policy based on the proposed model has the best performance on energy savings, returns on investment, and leverage effects. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the government should pay more attention to energy price.

AB  - Building energy efficiency rating systems have been established worldwide to systematically manage the energy consumption of existing buildings. This study aimed to develop a new energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings from two perspectives: (i) establishment of reasonable and fair criteria for the building energy efficiency rating system; and (ii) establishment of comparative incentive and penalty programs to encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign. Based on the analysis of the conventional energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings, this study was conducted in five steps: (i) data collection and analysis; (ii) correlation analysis between the household size and the CO2 emission density (i.e., CO2 emission per unit area); (iii) cluster formation based on results of the correlation analysis using a decision tree; (iv) establishment of a new energy efficiency rating system for existing buildings; and (v) establishment of incentive and penalty programs using advanced case-based reasoning. The proposed system can allow a policymaker to establish a reasonable and fair energy efficiency rating system for existing residential buildings and can encourage the voluntary participation of all residents in the energy saving campaign.

AB  - For several decades, manufactured housing has been a crucial source of affordable housing, particularly for rural areas. However, electricity consumption per unit area and per capita are substantially higher for manufactured housing units relative to site built, single-family detached units. This article uses data from the federal Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) to examine patterns of electricity consumption in manufactured housing units over time and to draw comparisons with single-family detached housing units. Regression analysis is used to model annual electricity consumption for manufactured housing units in 1990 and 2005. Temporal trends in key predictors are discussed and contrasted with those for single-family detached units. Findings suggest that the most important predictors of electricity consumption are comparable across the housing types considered and that while manufactured housing units may be gaining in energy efficiency over time, consumption per unit area and per capita are increasing faster than in single-family detached units.

AB  - Improving the energy efficiency of the existing housing stock is a high priority in Sweden. The focus of this viewpoint is on how incentives for improving energy efficiency are affected by pricing principles in two specific areas: housing rents and district heating fees. Many countries have regulations that affect how housing rent is determined. It has been shown that cost-based rents reduce incentives for energy efficiency. The same may occur if rent is related to qualities of the apartment, if these qualities do not include the indoor climate. There have been concerns that district heating companies might respond to lower sales by increasing prices, thus reducing any incentive to reduce energy consumption. It is argued that this will not happen if fixed and variable fees correctly reflect the cost structure. Empirical studies show that it is common to have a variable fee that is higher than the marginal cost, partly because of monopoly elements in the market. This type of pricing will actually strengthen the incentives for energy efficiency investments compared to theoretically correct pricing principles. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The split incentive problem concerns the lack of appropriate incentives to implement energy efficiency measures. In particular, low income tenants face a phenomenon of energy poverty in which they allocate significantly more of their household income to energy expenditures than other renters. This problem is substantial, affecting 1.89% of all United States' energy use. If effectively addressed, it would create a range of savings between 4 and 11 billion dollars per year for many of the nation's poorest residents. We argue that a carefully designed program of incentives for participants (including landlords) in conjunction with a unique type of utility-managed on-bill financing mechanism has significant potential to solve many of the complications. We focus on three kinds of split incentives, five concerns inherent to addressing split incentive problems (scale, endurance, incentives, savings, political disfavor), and provide a detailed policy proposal designed to surpass those problems, with a particular focus on low-income tenants in a U.S. context.

AB  - Energy savings in the housing sector are key to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to incentivize energy savings are however disparate between countries. Taking into account environmental aspects and consumer surplus, the paper uses a stylized economic model to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of three economic instruments: subsidies for renovation, subsidies for demolition and reconstruction projects and subsidies for building new houses on virgin land. The assessment also relates to differentiated value added taxes and other financial incentives such as green loans. In a counter-intuitive way, the model highlights that subsidies for renovations with minor energy gains worsen the overall energy consumption of housing due to the inducement of lock-ins with energy inefficient houses. Structural changes are needed in the use of policy instruments. First, commonly applied support schemes for renovations with minor energy savings should be abolished. Second, scarce public resources should incentivize deep renovation and demolition and reconstruction. Finally, taxes should apply on the use of virgin land to persuade households with a high willingness to pay for a new house, to invest in demolition and reconstruction.

AB  - Energy consumption in the commercial property sector offers an important opportunity for conserving resources. In this study, we evaluate the financial implications of two elements of ''sustainability'' - energy efficiency and accessibility - in the market for commercial real estate. An empirical analysis of some 1100 leasing transactions in the Netherlands over the 2005-2010 period shows that buildings designated as inefficient (with an EU energy performance certificate D or worse) command rental levels that are some 6.5 percent lower as compared to energy efficient, but otherwise similar buildings (labeled A, B or C). Furthermore, this study shows that office buildings in multi-functional areas, with access to public transport and facilities, achieve rental premiums over mono-functional office districts. For policymakers, the results documented in this paper provide an indication on the effectiveness of the EU energy performance certificate as a market signal in the commercial property sector. The findings documented here are also relevant for investors in European office markets, as the importance of energy efficiency and locational diversification is bound to increase following stricter environmental regulation and changing tenant preferences.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between operating expenses and rents of Energy Star and LEED certified buildings in the Central and Eastern United States. Several studies have shown that sustainable buildings command a rent premium compared to comparable conventional buildings. Lower operating expenses are expected to be a major source of the rent premium that sustainable buildings command. This is especially the case for buildings with triple-net leases, where tenants directly benefit from savings in operating costs. For a large dataset of U.S. office buildings this study finds significantly lower operating expenses in LEED certified buildings. However, savings in operating expenses only explain part of the rent premium. Additional factors must be at work. Surprisingly, we find significantly higher operating expenses in Energy Star rated buildings. Hence, intangible benefits appear to be the major source of rental premiums of Energy Star rated buildings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The residential sector offers considerable potential for reducing energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly through energy-efficient renovations. The objective of this study is twofold. First, I aim to provide initial empirical evidence of the extent to which split incentives between landlords and tenants may lead to underinvestment. Second, I investigate the influence of tax credits and energy burdens on energy efficiency expenditures. Given the complexity of studying the decision to invest in energy-saving renovations, I use a bivariate Tobit model to compare decisions about energy-efficient works and repair works, even when the renovation expenditures seem quite similar. The analysis shows that tenants are doubly penalized: they have high energy expenditures due to energy-inefficient building characteristics, and because they are poorer than homeowners, they are unable to invest in energy-saving systems. The results also confirm that tax credits are ineffective in the split incentives context. In terms of public policy, the government should focus on low-income tenants, and mandatory measures such as minimum standards seem appropriate. Financial support from a third-party financer also might be a solution. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421515300914]

AB  - Green building certification on college campuses is relatively new. When determining the financial feasibility of a certified green building at an institution of higher education, the full building lifecycle perspective is important to consider. In this paper, I first provide a background on campus sustainable development and green building rating systems. I then review the studies that have addressed the upfront green premium and down-the-line green building operating costs. Lastly, deficiencies in the studies are highlighted as well as future research recommendations in order to cure these deficiencies.

AB  - In this study, we first analyse energy-efficiency measures in existing electrically heated houses in Sweden from a societal economic perspective. Measures to a house envelopes and to energy supply chains are evaluated through a system analysis approach and we include the external costs of climate change and the effect of different Swedish climatic zones. We find that in a typical house from the 1970s, conversion from electric heating is highly motivated since the mitigation cost of conversion is lower than the estimated external costs of emitted CO"2. Both conversions and house envelope measures are more motivated in the northern part of the country, where there is a higher heat demand. A successful implementation of changes requires them to be attractive for consumers to adopt. We therefore secondly analyse the economic conditions for Swedish house owners to implement societal economic cost-efficient measures. We include the economic influence of an investment subsidy for heating system conversion, an income tax deduction for changing windows, customer electricity tax, real estate tax and of the cost of purchased energy from different energy suppliers. Apart from the economics, several other factors affect a house owner's decision to change heating systems. We therefore thirdly analyse house owners' perceptions of different heating supply alternatives based on the results of two comprehensive questionnaires. These different perspectives are combined in a discussion whether the studied policy instruments encourage house owners to implement changes in accordance with the energy-efficiency goals of decision makers. We find that the investment subsidy could be useful to break the lock-in effect of resistance heaters, which house owners seemed to experience. The electricity tax makes heating systems in line with national goals more competitive and efficiency measures to the house envelope more profitable. The reduction of the electricity tax in the northern part of the country has the opposite effect. Also, the increase in real estate tax when implementing energy-efficiency measures gives a contradictory message. The price differences between energy suppliers has a larger impact on the house owners' economic conditions than both subsidies and tax rate changes, and possibly also affect the house owner's attitudes towards various systems.

AB  - This paper addresses the viability of converting single-family residential buildings in Brazil into zero energy buildings (ZEBs). The European Union and the United States aim ZEBs implementation to address 'peak oil' and environmental concerns. However, literature shows no agreement on a consensual definition of ZEB. Seeking a Brazilian ZEB definition, this paper addresses PassivHaus and thermal comfort standards for hot climates, source metrics for ZEB, Brazil's energy mix, residential energy end uses and Brazilian legal framework for residential photovoltaic (PV) generation. Internal Rate of Return for PV systems in two Brazilian cities is calculated under various scenarios. It shows grid parity was reached from April 2012 to November 2012 assuming residential electric tariffs of that period and the financial conditions given by the Brazilian government for the construction of new dams in the Amazon and the lowest rates offered by Brazilian banks to private individuals. Governmental decision to lower electric residential tariffs in November 2012 reduced the scope of grid parity. Later revocation of a tax exemption in April 2013 ended grid parity in Brazil. It concludes, conversely to developed countries, it is the volatile Brazilian energy policy, instead of economical barriers, the main obstacle for ZEB viability in Brazil. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In recent years, formal certification programs for rating and evaluating the sustainability and energy efficiency of buildings have proliferated around the world. Developers recognize that such "green labels" differentiate products and allow them to charge a price premium. China has not formally adopted such rating standards. In the absence of such standards, developers are competing with each other based on their own self-reported indicators of their buildings' "greenness". We create an index using Google search to rank housing complexes in Beijing with respect to their "marketing greenness" and document that these "green" units sell for a price premium at the presale stage but they subsequently resell or rent for a price discount. An introduction of a standardized official certification program would help "green" demanders to acquire units that they desire and would accelerate the advance of China's nascent green real estate market.

AB  - The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) is an important European policy tool to improve energy performance of buildings and has been applied in 27 countries with specific adjustments. The aim of this paper is to analyze the application of the Portuguese energy certification system and regulation to the residential sector using a case type, whilst considering a set of alternative and complementary solutions involving the regulation values for the envelope, interior and exterior thermal insulation, lower air renovation ratio, light colored exterior walls, better glazing system, shading elements and a Trombe Wall. In order to understand the role and the importance of bioclimatic measures in the Portuguese application of the EPBD, a comparison with the Passivhaus Norm applied to warm countries in Europe will be made. Due to the diversity of the Portuguese climate, three different climate regions were considered. Finally, we will discuss what new measures should be added to the Portuguese regulation, so that the proposed recast of the Directive might be transformed into a more effective tool in the search for better energy performance, passive house buildings and sustainable constructions.

AB  - One of the key features of environmental policy integration in Sweden is sector responsibility. The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning is responsible for the building and real estate management sector and should, as a part of this responsibility, assess the environmental impacts of this sector. The aim of this study is to suggest and demonstrate a method for such an assessment. The suggested method is a life cycle assessment, based on an input-output analysis. The method can be used for regular monitoring and for prioritization between different improving measures. For the assessment to sufficiently cover the Swedish Environmental Quality Objectives, complementary information is needed, in particular with respect to the indoor environment. According to the results, the real estate management sector contributes between 10% and 40% of Swedish energy use; use of hazardous chemical products; generation of solid waste; emissions of gases contributing to climate change; and human toxicological impacts, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates. Transport and production of nonrenewable building materials contribute significantly to several of the emissions. Heating of buildings contributes more to energy use than to climate change, due to the use of renewable energy sources. To reduce climate change, measures should therefore prioritize not only heating of buildings but also the important upstream processes.

AB  - While many studies have shown that 'green price premiums' accompany the development of green buildings, there is still significant doubt among the public as to the financial viability of investments in energy efficiency. In this paper, we examine this issue from the developers' perspective, and draw on data from Singapore's Green Mark (GM) system, which was introduced in 2005 to evaluate the sustainability and energy-efficiency of buildings. We find that the 'green price premium' of residential developments arises largely during the resale phase, relative to the presale stage. The market premium of GM-rated units is about 10% at the resale stage, compared to about 4% during the presale stage. This implies that, while developers pay for almost all of the additional costs of energy efficiency during construction, they only share part of the benefits associated with such green investments. We also find no evidence that the development of green housing can immediately and significantly improve the corporate financial performance of Singaporean residential developers. These results provide the first evidence of the mismatch that developers face between outlays and benefits in the residential green building sector. This mismatch may impede further development of green residential properties. The emerging green real estate markets should be encouraged to introduce innovative business arrangements and financial products that allow residential developers to capture the future benefits associated with green properties.

AB  - Axon et al., (2012) argue that maximizing the potential for energy efficiency and demand reduction in tenanted commercial properties requires a 'building communities' approach. This paper develops and extends Axon et al.'s proposed framework in two ways. First, by extending its applicability from tenanted to owner-occupied properties. Second, by situating it within the literature related to organizational culture, occupant behaviours, and technology adoption. The paper begins with a brief review of the existing research on people, energy and commercial buildings. This literature tends to address either organizational choices, or occupant behavior, but it rarely crosses the analytical boundaries between these two groups. The paper then explores these different levels of analysis within a 3Cs -- 'concern, capacity, and conditions' -- framework, which was developed to describe and distinguish organizational responses to an energy crisis. The combination of the 'building communities' and 3Cs frames reveals gaps and grey areas between organizational culture, occupant behaviour, and technology adoption where further conservation opportunities may lie. These understudied areas suggest that there may be 'social potential' for change that is between and beyond the frames used by previous research in the field.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of the energy efficiency and sustainability of commercial properties on the operating and stock performance of a sample of US REITs, providing insight into the net benefits of green buildings. We match data on LEED- and Energy Star-certified buildings with detailed information on REIT portfolios and calculate the share of green properties for each REIT over the 2000-2011 period. We estimate a two-stage regression model and document that the greenness of REITs is positively related to three measures of operating performance -- return on assets, return on equity and the ratio of funds from operations to total revenue. We also document that there is no significant relationship between the greenness of property portfolios and abnormal stock returns, suggesting that stock prices already reflect the higher cash flows deriving from investments in more efficient properties. However, REITs with a higher fraction of green properties display significantly lower market betas. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - A number of international jurisdictions have articulated a longer term goal of zero emission housing standards. However, in Australia, housing energy efficiency remains a contested policy area. In part, this is due to a lack of clear cost-benefit information on low emission housing standards, including impacts at the household level. This research investigated the lifetime economics of low emission housing options for typical housing in Melbourne, Australia. The analysis found that for a zero emission house, there was an additional capital cost of $25,637. This translated into extra yearly mortgage repayments of $2,117 at an interest rate of 7.89% across 25 years. However, energy efficiency cost savings of $1,547 a year were calculated, leaving a gap of $570/year in additional mortgage repayments. As a result, policy makers in Australia should focus on reducing upfront costs and developing innovative financial frameworks in order to make low emission housing achievable.

AB  - Work on target-led transitions has highlighted the interdependence between 'niche' and 'regime' actors in steering change towards strategic goals. Similarly, market transformation (MT) has a long history in product markets, improving the energy efficiency of stocks of energy-using appliances through research, minimum standards, energy labels, incentives, procurement, competitions, and stakeholder networks. Attempts to apply MT to buildings have failed to fully take account of the differences between appliance markets and the multiple markets which frame energy use in buildings. The case of refurbishment of UK housing is considered here, for which there is a system of different markets in operation. MT principles are considered in relation to the sources and diffusion of innovation in project-based industries; the management of different expectations among innovators and incumbents; technical risks associated with doing low-carbon refurbishment work; and the role of policy in simultaneously stimulating supply and demand. An iterative process with feedback loops and coordination is proposed to link training, standard-setting, and compliance checks. No institutional infrastructure exists for such an enterprise, which would need to cross established boundaries between regime actors. The case of UK housing refurbishment throws up lessons for theory, research, and practice which could be developed through further case studies. Reprinted by permission of Pion Limited

AB  - Issue Title: 2013 Maastricht-NUS-MIT International Real Estate Finance & Economics SymposiumThe scaling of energy efficiency initiatives in the commercial building sector has been hampered by data limitations, information asymmetries, and benchmarking methodologies that do not adequately model patterns of energy consumption, nor provide accurate measures of relative energy performance. The reliance on simple metrics, such as Energy Use Intensity (EUI), fails to account for significant variation across occupancy, construction characteristics and other elements of a building - both its design and its users - that influence building energy consumption. Using a unique dataset of actual building energy use, physical, spatial, and occupancy characteristics - collected from New York City's Local Law 84 energy disclosure database, the Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) database, and the CoStar Group - this paper analyzes energy consumption across commercial office buildings and presents a new methodology for a market-specific benchmarking model to measure relative energy performance across peer buildings. A robust predictive model is developed to normalize across multiple building characteristics and to provide the basis for a multivariate energy performance index. The paper concludes with recommendations for data collection standards, computational approaches for building energy disclosure data, and targeted policies using k-means clustering and market segmentation.

This article explains challenges involved in innovation in home building, as well as providing planners with strategies to influence innovation in the industry. The author reviews the literature and identify sources of resistance to or acceptance of innovation in home building. He also reports the results of two national surveys of innovation adoption and use regression analysis to test variables likely to inhibit or promote innovation. Small builders receptive to innovation are likely to be led by a technology champion and to build custom homes for a relatively affluent and informed clientele. In order to impact a larger portion of the housing market, large production builders should be the target for innovations that contribute to affordability in entry-level homes or to energy efficiency, sustainability and durability in higher priced houses.

AB  - According to the recast of the Energy Performance Building Directive, Member States must give an exact definition for nearly zero-energy buildings to be introduced from 2018/2020. The requirement system stipulating the sustainable development of the building sector is usually based on the analysis of a few reference buildings, combining energy efficiency measures and HVAC systems. The risk of this method is that depending on the assumptions either the requirements do not provide sufficient incentives for energy saving measures and renewables or the requirements cannot be fulfilled with rational solutions in many cases. Our method is based on the artificial generation of a large building sample, where the buildings are defined by geometric and other parameters. Due to the large number of combinations, the effect of many variables appear in the results, with the deviations reflecting the sensitivity of the energy balance. The requirements are set based on some fundamental considerations and the statistical analysis of the sample. The method is demonstrated on the example of setting the requirements for residential buildings in Hungary. The proposed requirements are validated against the common European targets. The suggested method is suitable for developing building energy regulation threshold values, certification schemes or benchmarking values. All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - While the concept of reflective roofing is not new to China, most Chinese cool roof research has taken place within the past decade. Some national and local Chinese building energy efficiency standards credit or recommend, but do not require, cool roofs or walls. EnergyPlus simulations of standard-compliant Chinese office and residential building prototypes in seven Chinese cities (Harbin, Changchun, Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou) showed that substituting an aged white roof (albedo 0.6) for an aged gray roof (albedo 0.2) yields positive annual load, energy, energy cost, CO2, NOx, and SO2 savings in all hot-summer cities (Chongqing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou). Measurements in an office building in Chongqing in August 2012 found that a white coating lowered roof surface temperature by about 20 °C, and reduced daily air conditioning energy use by about 9%. Measurements in a naturally ventilated factory in Guangdong Province in August 2011 showed that a white coating decreased roof surface temperature by about 17 °C, lowered room air temperature by 1-3 °C, and reduced daily roof heat flux by 66%. Simulation and experimental results suggest that cool roofs should be credited or prescribed in building energy efficiency standards for both hot summer/warm winter and hot summer/cold winter climates in China.

AB  - Ireland's housing stock has been identified as being amongst the least energy efficient in Northern Europe. Consequently, atmospheric emissions are greater than necessary. Government funded schemes have been introduced to incentivise the uptake of thermal retrofit measures in the domestic Irish market. A study of Ireland's housing highlights the dominance of detached houses (43%), 72% of which are rurally located and are predominantly heated with fuel oil. This paper investigates the economic and carbon case for thermal retrofit measures to the existing detached, oil centrally heated, rural housing stock. The study found the case for energy efficiency measures to be categorical and supports the Irish Government's focus on energy efficiency policy measures. Thermal retrofit measures in the detached housing stock have the potential to realise an averaged 65% theoretical reduction in heating costs and CO2 emissions for houses constructed prior to 1979 (coinciding with the introduction of building regulations) and around 26% for newer homes, thus offering a significant contribution (44%) to Ireland's residential carbon abatement projections and hence in meeting the EU's directives on energy and carbon. The greatest savings (36%) of Ireland's carbon abatement projections result from improving the energy efficiency of the pre 1979 stock. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT] All rights reserved, Elsevier

AB  - This paper models the adoption of commercial building energy codes in the US between 1977 and 2006. Energy code adoption typically results in an increase in aggregate social welfare by cost effectively reducing energy expenditures. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, I test if relative state funding, a new, objective, multivariate regression-derived measure of government capacity, as well as a vector of control variables commonly used in comparative state research, predict commercial building energy code adoption. The research shows little political influence over historical commercial building energy code adoption in the sample. Colder climates and higher electricity prices also do not predict more frequent code adoptions. I do find evidence of high government capacity states being 60 percent more likely than low capacity states to adopt commercial building energy codes in the following year. Wealthier states are also more likely to adopt commercial codes. Policy recommendations to increase building code adoption include increasing access to low cost capital for the private sector and providing noncompetitive block grants to the states from the federal government.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore social barriers to the adoption of smart homes through the analysis of expert views and public attitudes. Smart home services aim to improve the comfort, convenience and safety of householders, as well as allowing them to use energy more efficiently and cope with increasing costs. Despite the existence of smart homes and smart home technologies for some time, their prevalence is not widespread, and thus their potential largely untapped. Using a combination of in-depth deliberative public workshops, expert interviews and a review of the existing literature, this paper explores social barriers to smart home diffusion, including how these vary by expertise, life-stage and location. The research highlights the importance of barriers such as control, security, and cost, providing insights for policymakers as well as smart-home designers and developers as to how these might be addressed.

AB  - Identifying the key influencing factors of CO2 emissions in China's iron and steel industry is vital for mitigating its emissions and formulating effective environmental protection measures. Most of the existing researches utilized time series data to investigate the driving factors of the industry's CO2 emission at the national level, but regional differences have not been given appropriate attention. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2000 to 2013 and panel data models to examine the key driving forces of CO2 emissions at the regional levels in China. The results show that industrialization dominates the industry's CO2 emissions, but its effect varies across regions. The impact of energy efficiency on CO2 emissions in the eastern region is greater than in the central and western regions because of a huge difference in RD investment. The influence of urbanization has significant regional differences due to the heterogeneity in human capital accumulation and real estate development. Energy structure has large potential to mitigate CO2 emissions on account of increased RD investment in energy-saving technology and expanded clean energy use. Hence, in order to effectively achieve emission reduction, local governments should consider all these factors as well as regional heterogeneity in formulating appropriate mitigation policies.

AB  - This paper investigates the effects of the energy efficiency and sustainability of commercial properties on the operating and stock performance of a sample of US REITs, providing insight into the net benefits of green buildings. We match data on LEED- and Energy Star-certified buildings with detailed information on REIT portfolios and calculate the share of green properties for each REIT over the 2000-2011 period. We estimate a two-stage regression model and document that the greenness of REITs is positively related to three measures of operating performance -- return on assets, return on equity and the ratio of funds from operations to total revenue. We also document that there is no significant relationship between the greenness of property portfolios and abnormal stock returns, suggesting that stock prices already reflect the higher cash flows deriving from investments in more efficient properties. However, REITs with a higher fraction of green properties display significantly lower market betas. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - In 2004, the Dutch National Sustainable Building Center set up a research project to investigate the widespread belief that sustainable building is more expensive than standard building practice. The results disproved this assumption and demonstrated that sustainable building can be financially profitable. However, the research also showed that these positive financial aspects are hardly ever used to promote sustainable building. SenterNovem initiated a new research project in order to recommend practical solutions for the identified issues. Besides the sustainable and 'regular' building sectors, the new project included other sectors in an effort to develop new insights. Focused on housing, this second project revealed the inevitability of a labeling system that covers all activities ('one language'). It recommends giving top priority to the introduction of a labeling system that translates sustainability in housing into a manageable and controllable system. The system should clearly identify the level of sustainability of a specific house. To gain acceptance among consumers, the system would have to tie in with consumer needs. The idea that many financial incentives can be linked to this labeling system was affirmed in a separate workshop. Just before the second research project was completed, the Dutch housing corporation Oost Flevoland Woondiensten (OFW) introduced a labeling system for their entire stock related to the topics of energy and health. Nine months after the launch, an assessment of this labeling system confirmed the results of the theoretical research and the workshop. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Attention to 'sustainability' and energy efficiency rating schemes in the commercial property sector has increased rapidly during the past decade. In the UK, commercial properties have been certified under the BREEAM rating scheme since 1999, offering fertile ground to investigate the economic dynamics of 'green' certification in the commercial property market. This paper documents that, over the 2000-09 period, the expanding supply of green buildings within a given London neighbourhood had a positive impact on average rents and prices, but reduced rents and prices for environmentally certified real estate. The results suggest that there is a gentrification effect from green buildings. However, each additional 'green' building decreases the marginal effect of certification in the rental and transaction markets by 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. In addition, controlling for lease contract features, like contract length and the rent-free period, modifies the impact of environmental certification on rental prices.

AB  - The scaling of energy efficiency initiatives in the commercial building sector has been hampered by data limitations, information asymmetries, and benchmarking methodologies that do not adequately model patterns of energy consumption, nor provide accurate measures of relative energy performance. The reliance on simple metrics, such as Energy Use Intensity (EUI), fails to account for significant variation across occupancy, construction characteristics and other elements of a building DS both its design and its users DS that influence building energy consumption. Using a unique dataset of actual building energy use, physical, spatial, and occupancy characteristics DS collected from New York City's Local Law 84 energy disclosure database, the Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) database, and the CoStar Group DS this paper analyzes energy consumption across commercial office buildings and presents a new methodology for a market-specific benchmarking model to measure relative energy performance across peer buildings. A robust predictive model is developed to normalize across multiple building characteristics and to provide the basis for a multivariate energy performance index. The paper concludes with recommendations for data collection standards, computational approaches for building energy disclosure data, and targeted policies using Italic  k  -means clustering and market segmentation.

AB  - In recent years, there has been growing global recognition of the need to reduce carbon emissions in response to climate change concerns. It is generally acknowledged that the energy efficiency of existing homes can be improved, but there are significant barriers to its uptake. In particular, improving the energy efficiency of private rental housing presents unique policy challenges due to a split-incentive problem. This has prompted some governments to introduce programmes that encourage landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties. While landlords are responsible for the purchase of many energy-consuming household appliances, tenants are responsible for energy bills. Since the landlord does not reap the immediate benefits of investment in energy-efficient equipment, the incentives motivating such investment are weaker than for homeowners. This paper aims to quantify the magnitude of the split-incentive problem in the Australian private rental housing market by invoking a modelling approach where energy expenditure is estimated as a function of housing tenure, dwelling type, location, climate and other socio-demographic variables. We find no evidence in support of the split-incentive hypothesis in Australia. The paper concludes that differences in housing policy arrangements could be critical to the presence and importance of split incentives. Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - Von Hippel and colleagues have highlighted the crucial role of users in innovation in different industries and types of products. They describe the innovation process in terms of the distinct domains of knowledge that producers and users possess. Producers have knowledge about technical solutions and users about their needs, the context of use, and their own capabilities as users. Both sets of knowledge are characterized by stickiness: They move relatively freely within their own domain but are difficult to transfer outside of it. In the case of radical innovations for sustainable consumption, the problem of sticky information is compounded. Both producers and consumers need to reach out of their conventional competencies and search for new solutions. Societal actors, such as government bodies or environmental experts, can show the way to such solutions, but this new knowledge needs to be integrated with the sticky knowledge about everyday practices in production and consumption. In the present article we attempt to conceptualize the role and interaction of user and producer knowledge with the knowledge of environmental experts in housing energy innovations. We do so by applying the user-producer interaction framework to a case study on the introduction of low-energy housing concepts in Finland. On the basis of this analysis, we draw conclusions on the potential and limitations of today's practices in the field. For example, we suggest that user involvement can help to enhance the acceptance of low-energy solutions but that the methods for involving users need to be adapted to the particular circumstances in each industry.

AB  - This paper provides the first credible evidence on the economic value of 'green buildings' derived from impersonal market transactions rather than engineering estimates. We analyze clusters of certified green and nearby buildings, establishing that 'rated' buildings command substantially higher rents and selling prices than otherwise identical buildings. Variations in premiums are systematically related to energy-saving characteristics. Increased energy efficiency is associated with increased selling prices -- beyond the premiums paid for a labeled building. Evidence suggests that the intangible effects of the label itself may also play a role in determining the values of green buildings in the marketplace. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Over the last 30 years, China's economy has boomed. This trend has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty but it has also sharply increased local, regional, and global pollution levels. We look at the rise in air pollution over recent decades, and the perhaps surprising finding that in many of China's urban areas, levels of particulates (of less than 10 microns) have been decreasing during the last 10 to 15 years. We then turn to the costs and tradeoffs of air pollution, including costs to human health, reductions in worker productivity, and how people are seeking to reduce their exposure to pollution as shown by compensating differentials in real estate prices and purchases of masks and air filters. We discuss how rising incomes tend to raise the demand for environmental amenities and thus increase political pressure for environmental protection, and then we turn to the policy tools that China has used to reduce pollution. We conclude by arguing that as China's government is preparing for an additional 300 million people to move to urban areas over the next 30 years, it will have a number of opportunities for China to reduce pollution through a shift from manufacturing to services, along with various steps to improve energy efficiency and resource conservation. Overall, it seems that China is on track to improve its environmental performance in the years ahead.

AB  - Executive Summary. This is an empirical study of the economics of green (LEED and ENERGY STAR) designation among all downtown Chicago office transactions spanning 12 years. Green properties achieve on-average higher occupancies and prices / sf compared to non-green properties. The hedonic, repeat-sale, and transaction frequency models applied provide evidence of the price "bubble" in 2006-07 and the importance of green designation. LEED properties sold for a 23% price / sf premium, while an ENERGY STAR designation had no effect. Also, LEED Class A properties transacted 68% less than non-LEED, while ENERGY STAR Class B properties transacted 23% more than non-ENERGY STAR. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that significant capital expenditures for achieving a greener property require longer cost recovery holding periods.

AB  - Energy consumption in the residential sector offers an important opportunity for conserving resources. However, much of the current debate regarding energy efficiency in the housing market focuses on the physical and technical determinants of energy consumption, neglecting the role of the economic behavior of resident households. In this paper, we analyze the extent to which the use of gas and electricity is determined by the technical specifications of the dwelling as compared to the demographic characteristics of the residents. Our analysis is based on a sample of more than 300,000 Dutch homes and their occupants. The results indicate that residential gas consumption is determined principally by structural dwelling characteristics, such as the vintage, building type, and characteristics of the dwelling, while electricity consumption varies more directly with household composition, in particular income and family composition. Combining these results with projections on future economic and demographic trends, we find that, even absent price increases for residential energy, the aging of the population and their increasing wealth will roughly offset improvements in the energy efficiency of the building stock resulting from policy interventions and natural revitalization.

AB  - Government-led interorganizational alliance networks present a sensible opportunity to overcome many societal challenges through collaborative governance. In particular, few researchers have studied alliance networks in the field of energy conservation in commercial buildings -- a sector with unique barriers to greater diffusion of innovative cost-saving strategies. We applied an analytic inductive case-based method and social network analysis to study one particular alliance network: the United States Commercial Building Energy Alliances representing interests from retail, commercial real estate, and healthcare sectors. This alliance network was initiated by the United States Department of Energy, with assistance from several federally funded research laboratories in the United States, to promote the diffusion of knowledge and ultimately encourage greater deployment of energy efficiency and clean energy strategies in commercial buildings. We draw upon interview data from 28 cases of private, non-profit, and governmental organizations and complete network data from the alliance participants. We honed in on eight focal cases of governmental organizations to provide insight on how the four forms of energy and environmental data, information, and knowledge shared within an alliance network address the challenge of a vastly underutilized energy resource, namely conservation. Further, we identify and discuss the public's four roles -- Commissioner, Interpreter, Marketer, and User -- in providing balance to the diffusion of both private and public goods in a network.

AB  - From the perspectives of the energy and the environment, building stock should be considered a useful resource in the struggle against greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy resources. The aim of this work is to provide an example of the application of a methodology to evaluate the energy needs of the building stock of a city and to determine the possible strategies for energy planning. This paper aims to obtain an estimate, on an urban scale, of the energy needs and CO2 emissions of the public residential buildings of Bari. This estimate is achieved by evaluating the critical issues of the built heritage, the most common architectural typologies and the heating systems in the territory of the city of Bari in southern Italy, as well as the possible strategies for upgrading energy efficiency, through the combined use of energy software and geo-referenced systems. Furthermore, several possible interventions are assumed to improve the energy performance of buildings in not only environmental terms but also economic terms through the instrument of cost-benefit analysis. The ultimate goal is to compare the different intervention strategies to determine which demonstrate greater cost effectiveness and feasibility for future energy planning.

AB  - Key elements of present investment decision-making regarding energy efficiency of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings are the marginal costs of energy efficiency measures and incomplete knowledge of investors and architects about pricing, co-benefits and new technologies. This paper reports on a recently completed empirical study for the Swiss residential sector. It empirically quantifies the marginal costs of energy efficiency investments (i.e. additional insulation, improved window systems, ventilation and heating systems and architectural concepts). For the private sector, first results on the economic valuation of co-benefits such as improved comfort of living, improved indoor air quality, better protection against external noise, etc. may amount to the same order of magnitude as the energy-related benefits are given. The costbenefit analysis includes newly developed technologies that show large variations in prices due to pioneer market pricing, add-on of learning costs and risk components of the installers. Based on new empirical data on the present cost-situation and past techno-economic progress, the potential of future cost reduction was estimated applying the experience curve concept. The paper shows, for the first time, co-benefits and cost dynamics of energy efficiency investments, of which decision makers in the real estate sector, politics and administrations are scarcely aware.

AB  - Requiring energy efficiency building codes raises housing prices (or the monthly rental equivalent), but theoretically this effect might be fully offset by reductions in household energy expenditures. Whether there is a full compensating differential or how much households are paying implicitly is an empirical question. This study estimates the net implicit price of energy efficient buildings codes, IECC 2003 through IECC 2006, for American households. Using sample data from the American Community Survey 2007, a heteroskedastic seemingly unrelated estimation approach is used to estimate hedonic price (house rent) and energy expenditure models. The value of energy efficiency building codes is capitalized into housing rents, which are estimated to increase by 23.25 percent with the codes. However, the codes provide households a compensating differential of about a 6.47 percent reduction (about $7.71) in monthly energy expenditure. Results indicate that the mean household net implicit price for these codes is about $140.87 per month in 2006 dollars ($163.19 in 2013 dollars). However, this estimated price is shown to vary significantly by region, energy type and the rent gradient.

AB  - For several decades, manufactured housing has been a crucial source of affordable housing, particularly for rural areas. However, electricity consumption per unit area and per capita are substantially higher for manufactured housing units relative to site built, single-family detached units. This article uses data from the federal Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) to examine patterns of electricity consumption in manufactured housing units over time and to draw comparisons with single-family detached housing units. Regression analysis is used to model annual electricity consumption for manufactured housing units in 1990 and 2005. Temporal trends in key predictors are discussed and contrasted with those for single-family detached units. Findings suggest that the most important predictors of electricity consumption are comparable across the housing types considered and that while manufactured housing units may be gaining in energy efficiency over time, consumption per unit area and per capita are increasing faster than in single-family detached units.

AB  - This paper provides the first credible evidence on the economic value of "green buildings" derived from impersonal market transactions rather than engineering estimates. We analyze clusters of certified green and nearby buildings, establishing that "rated" buildings command substantially higher rents and selling prices than otherwise identical buildings. Variations in premiums are systematically related to energy-saving characteristics. Increased energy efficiency is associated with increased selling prices -- beyond the premiums paid for a labeled building. Evidence suggests that the intangible effects of the label itself may also play a role in determining the values of green buildings in the marketplace. (JEL G31,M14,Q52,R33) [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Analiza je provedena na podacima za 16 razvijenih EU država u razdoblju od 1990. do 2018. te za 11 posttranzicijskih EU država u razdoblju od 1995. do 2018. Dobiveni rezultati usporeðeni su s rezultatima dobivenim za razdoblje do 2014.godine. Za kvantificiranje kratkoročnog i dugoročnog utjecaja, primijenjen je združeni procjenitelj aritmetičke sredine grupe (PMG). Prema empirijskim rezultatima potrošnja oba izvora energije u dugom roku značajno utječe na ekonomski rast u obje skupine zemalja. Meðutim, rezultati se razlikuju izmeðu razvijenih i posttranzicijskih EU zemalja. U razvijenim EU zemljama potrošnja obnovljivih izvora energije ima negativan utjecaj na ekonomski rast, dok potrošnja neobnovljivih izvora energije ima pozitivan utjecaj. U post-tranzicijskim EU zemljama rezultati su suprotni, što znači da u tim zemljama postoji tendencija prelaska s manje učinkovitih i onečišćujućih izvora energije na učinkovitije energetske opcije koje mogu biti poticaj ekonomskom rastu.

AB  - Identifying free-ridership is significant to several issues relevant to program evaluation, including the calculation of net program benefits and assessments of political acceptability. Despite the potential of free-ridership to seriously undermine the economic efficiency of a program intervention, for instance to foster energy efficiency, the issue remains largely absent from contemporary environmental and energy policy discussions in Europe. One reason for this neglect is the inherent difficulty of assessing which households would have undertaken the energy conservation activity even without the program. This paper proposes a procedure to calculate the free-rider share using revealed preference data on home renovations from Germany's residential sector. We employ a discrete-choice model to analyze the effect of grants on renovation choices, the output from which is used to assess the extent of free-ridership under a subsidy program very akin to an implemented grants program in Germany. Our empirical results suggest only very moderate energy savings induced by the program, making free-riding a problem of outstanding importance.

AB  - Vowing to pump $150 billion into green technology over the next decade, US Pres Barack Obama has made big promises about his environmental agenda. Even the US Congress is considering a range of measures to reduce greenhouse gases -- from regulatory mandates, such as raising vehicle fuel economy or requiring electric utilities to produce more of their power from renewable sources, to carbon taxes and a cap-and-trade system for electric utilities. China is now pumping more than 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere each year, to say nothing of the sulfur dioxide and particulates that pose a major public health threat. Amid soaring energy costs, Germany and Spain cut back on their solar subsidies; now, many producers are struggling to survive on their own. Today, all over the world, cities with high quality of life and high environmental quality feature higher housing prices and less out-migration of skilled workers than nearby cities with a lower quality of life.

AB  - The built environment can be used to influence travel demand, but very few studies consider the relative energy savings of such policies in context of a complex urban system. This analysis quantifies the day-to-day and embodied energy consumption of four different neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, to examine how built environment variations influence various sources of urban energy consumption. A microsimulation combines models for petroleum use (from driving) and residential and commercial power and natural gas use with rigorously measured building stock and infrastructure materials quantities (to arrive at embodied energy). Results indicate that the more suburban neighborhoods, with mostly detached single-family homes, consume up to 320% more embodied energy, 150% more operational energy, and about 160% more total life-cycle energy (per capita) than a densely developed neighborhood with mostly low-rise-apartments and duplexes. Across all neighborhoods, operational energy use comprised 83 to 92% of total energy use, and transportation sources (including personal vehicles and transit, plus street, parking structure, and sidewalk infrastructure) made up 44 to 47% of the life-cycle energy demands tallied. Energy elasticity calculations across the neighborhoods suggest that increased population density and reduced residential unit size offer greatest life-cycle energy savings per capita, by reducing both operational demands from driving and home energy use, and from less embodied energy from construction. These results provide measurable metrics for comparing different neighborhood styles and develop a framework to anticipate energy-savings from changes in the built environment versus household energy efficiency.

AB  - There is an active and growing literature examining the rental rate, sales price, and occupancy premiums associated with sustainable or energy efficient certified real estate. To date, the focus has rested largely on office properties and for sale single family residential properties. We examine the rental rates achieved by green multifamily properties, providing the first look at the population of LEED market-rate apartments in the United States. We find an approximate 8.9 % rental rate premium associated with LEED apartments. Moreover, this research provides the first indication that LEED certification garners an additional premium over non-certified space that identifies as green, indicating the strength of the certification signal and contributing to the longstanding discussion on the merits of certification.

AB  - This study examines the effects of green or eco-friendly certificates and awards on consumers' perceived value within the hotel industry, and the roles of consumers' perceived value in predicting satisfaction, intention to revisit, and intention to pay a green premium. The results of partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis from a sample of 250 guests in Sri Lankan hotels showed that our unified model includes a satisfactory level of prediction power to test the hypothesized relationships. Green certificates and green awards positively affect consumers' perceived value within the hotel industry. The findings also supported the relationship between consumers' perceived value and satisfaction, intention to revisit, and intention to pay a green premium. The empirical findings in the context of Sri Lanka provide another important insight which confirms the positive effects of green certification and green awards on consumers' perceived value and behavioral intentions, such as their intention to revisit and to pay a premium.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore social barriers to the adoption of smart homes through the analysis of expert views and public attitudes. Smart home services aim to improve the comfort, convenience and safety of householders, as well as allowing them to use energy more efficiently and cope with increasing costs. Despite the existence of smart homes and smart home technologies for some time, their prevalence is not widespread, and thus their potential largely untapped. Using a combination of in-depth deliberative public workshops, expert interviews and a review of the existing literature, this paper explores social barriers to smart home diffusion, including how these vary by expertise, life-stage and location. The research highlights the importance of barriers such as control, security, and cost, providing insights for policymakers as well as smart-home designers and developers as to how these might be addressed.

AB  - In theory, food handling in collaborative housing systems could have a number of environmental advantages compared with households and food service institutions. This paper explores to what extent some of these theoretical advantages are realised in two collaborative housing units in a major Swedish city. Food-related energy use and waste flows were measured and compared with results from food service institutions and some data relevant for households. Results show that energy use for cooking decreases in collaborative houses compared with households but energy use for food storage increases. Plate and food preparation wastes are low in the studied collaborative houses but food leftovers may be abundant. The latter result depends on how the dining system is organised. A bottleneck for improving the environmental efficiency in collaborative housing is the static view of apartment design held by many architects and real estate owners. Another bottleneck may be the unwillingness of households to make advance commitments to daily dining. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Blair Wimbush, NS vice president  for real estate and the railroads corporate sustainability officer, said setting its emission-reduction goal is an important step toward fulfillment of Norfolk Southern's objective to achieve industry leadership in environmentally responsible business practices. Disclosing our carbon footprint last year was the first step. Now, we move forward with an aggressive yet realistic goal, and we have the tools to measure our progress toward attaining it."In 2009, NS hauled 158.5 billion ton-miles of freight, producing 4.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases mainly from its diesel-burning locomotives. That produced emissions per revenue ton-mile of 30 grams. Cutting emissions 10 percent in five years would bring them to 27 grams per revenue ton-mile for the same freight volume, NS said, and put 475,000 fewer metric tons into the atmosphere a year by 2014.
