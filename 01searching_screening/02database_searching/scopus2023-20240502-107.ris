AB  - The decarbonisation of the construction sector is critical to meet national and international climate goals. Literature gives many examples of measures for the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings. However, few studies investigate the trade-offs between potentially conflicting GHG emission reduction measures or the affordability of these measures. Ydalir is a Zero Emission Neighbourhood (ZEN) pilot area in the Norwegian research centre for Zero Emission Neighbourhoods in smart cities. One of the major challenges Ydalir faces is how to reduce GHG emissions from the neighbourhood towards a net zero emission building (nZEB). Additional challenges include retaining social, environmental, and economical sustainability for both the project developer and building owners and avoid suboptimal solutions. This paper investigates the trade-offs between energy efficiency and material use for two scenarios. The scenarios are a Norwegian building code scenario and a passive house scenario. The analysis ascertains total energy demand, whole life cycle GHG emissions, and cost assessment for two housing units within Ydalir Torg. The results show lower total GHG emissions and lower GHG emissions from operational energy use in the passive house scenario, and an increase in GHG emissions from the production phase due to thicker levels of insulation. The cost assessment shows increased investment costs for the project developer in the passive house scenario, despite lower operational costs for the building owner. Total GHG emission payback times for the passive house scenario are at 18 - 19 years. Cost payback time varies between 10 - 37 years. This paper is useful for practitioners that wish to balance GHG emission reduction requirements between operational energy use, material use and affordability.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The chapter begins with a critical discussion of BIM in real estate (RE) operations. The number of product announcements, events and publications in the field of BIM far outweighs the number of implemented projects. The chapter shows what current and past research offers to remove existing obstacles to the use of BIM in RE operations. Based on an overview of most important initiatives in the field of standardization, the chapter first introduces research activities for digitally capturing existing buildings. Approaches to (partially) automated processing of 3D point clouds from 3D laser scans or photogrammetric surveys for the creation of BIM models of existing buildings are presented (Scan2BIM). Another research area concerns the management of BIM models during the operational phase. Innovative approaches to Common Data Environments (CDE) for RE operations based on virtual linked data integration are explained as well as the development of open platforms for the selection and support of continuous, digital tool chains for BIM processes. In the field of visualization and virtual, augmented or mixed reality, first practical implementations are presented based on selected research initiatives. BIM opens up new opportunities for using the facility manager's know-how more easily within the planning phase. The section highlights research initiatives to develop assistance systems up to a framework for BIM-based knowledge management systems. It is also important to efficiently convey knowledge from RE operations and facility management (FM) to practitioners, trainees and students. For this purpose, new possibilities are presented using 3D gaming environments in so-called serious games. Finally, the chapter addresses research focussing on sustainability, energy efficiency and CO2 optimization. Approaches to the use of BIM for the simplified creation of ecological balance sheets with IFC-based building models are presented as well as the development of an open platform for the calculation and optimization of the CO2 footprint of facility services in RE operations. Approaches to research and testing of future scenarios for smart buildings finalize the chapter. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Modern computing systems are processor-centric. Data processing (i.e., computation) happens only in the processor (e.g., a CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC). As such, data needs to be moved from where it is generated/captured (e.g., sensors) and stored (e.g., storage and memory devices) to the processor before it can be processed. The processor-centric design paradigm greatly limits the performance & energy-efficiency, as well as scalability & sustainability, of modern computing systems. Many studies show that even the most powerful processors and accelerators waste a large fraction (e.g., >60%) of their time simply waiting for data and energy on moving data between storage/memory units to the processor. This is so even though most of the hardware real estate of such systems is dedicated to data storage and communication (e.g., many levels of caches, DRAM chips, storage systems, and interconnects).Memory-centric computing aims to enable computation capability in and near all places where data is generated and stored. As such, it can greatly reduce the large negative performance and energy impact of data access and data movement, by fundamentally avoiding data movement and reducing data access latency & energy. Many recent studies show that memory-centric computing can greatly improve system performance and energy efficiency. Major industrial vendors and startup companies have also recently introduced memory chips that have sophisticated computation capabilities.This talk describes promising ongoing research and development efforts in memory-centric computing. We classify such efforts into two major fundamental categories: 1) processing using memory, which exploits analog operational properties of memory structures to perform massively-parallel operations in memory, and 2) processing near memory, which integrates processing capability in memory controllers, the logic layer of 3D-stacked memory technologies, or memory chips to enable high-bandwidth and low-latency memory access to near-memory logic. We show both types of architectures (and their combination) can enable orders of magnitude improvements in performance and energy consumption of many important workloads, such as graph analytics, databases, machine learning, video processing, climate modeling, genome analysis. We discuss adoption challenges for the memory-centric computing paradigm and conclude with some research & development opportunities. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: By comparing regression models, this study aims to analyze the added home value of green sustainability features and green efficiency characteristics, rather than green certifications, in the city of Austin. Design/methodology/approach: The adoption of home green energy efficiency upgrades has emerged as a new trend in the real estate industry, offering several benefits to builders and home buyers. These include tax reductions, health improvements and energy savings. Previous studies have shown that energy-certified single-family homes command a premium in the marketplace. However, the literature is limited in its analysis of the effects of green upgrades and certification on different types of single-family homes. To address this gap, this research collected data from 21,292 multiple listing services (MLS) closed home-selling listings in Austin, Texas, over a period of 35 months. Findings: The analysis results showed that green efficiency features could generally increase single-family housing prices by 11.9%, whereas green sustainability upgrades can potentially bring a 11.7% higher selling price. Although green housing certification did not have significant effects on most housing groups, it did increase closing prices by 13.2% for single-family residences sold at the medium price range, which is higher than the impacts from simply listing the green features on MLS. Originality/value: The study contributes to the body of knowledge by examining the market value of broadly defined energy efficiency and sustainability features in the residential housing market. The findings can help policymakers, brokerage firms, home builders and owners adjust their policies and strategies related to single-family home sales and mortgage approvals. The research also highlights the potential benefits of capitalizing on green housing features other than certifications. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to solve the main problem – the choice of effective models in the construction of energy-efficient real estate objects. This goal is solved by choosing organizational and technological factors at each stage of the life cycle that affect the construction of an energy-efficient real estate object and planning a numerical experiment; identifying patterns of influence of organizational and technological factors (number of working hours per week, equipment with energy technologies, costs and conditions of construction) on the technical and economic indicators of an energy-efficient real estate object. Since the use of mathematical modeling in the design and improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings is the main tool that allows you to take into account the organizational and technological factors affecting the energy efficiency of buildings at all stages of its life cycle, then in our research we used the mathematical theory of experiment planning, which is the basis of the theory experimental statistical modeling. Based on the results of the numerical experiment, the mathematical theory of experiment planning was used. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Legislation to increase building energy efficiency is a key climate change policy instrument in many countries. Although most of these regulations concern the housing stock, office buildings are also a considerable source of greenhouse gas emissions. Office markets face fewer pricing regulations than the residential market and may thus provide a clearer pricing signal of any policy impacts. This paper focusses on the introduction of Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) in England and Wales. Applying machine-learning methods, Difference in Differences (DiD) and Fixed Effects (FE) panel data estimation to a comprehensive database of the London office market, our results suggest that the MEES policy has had a measurable and significant impact and lowered the rents of the combined group of affected office units by 6–8% following the announcement of MEES and in the run-up to implementation. A weakly significant 4.4% rental discount is detected for the bordering but unaffected class of EPC E-rated office buildings relative to the A–C EPC group, perhaps due to market expectations of a further expansion of MEES. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - This study emerged from the necessity to analyze the most effective energy-saving strategies within the current real estate market and substantiate their application with empirical data. Undoubtedly, the adoption of External Thermal Insulation Composite Systems (ETICSs) stands out as one of the prevalent approaches. This article presents temperature-monitoring data collected on-site from the facades of two single-family homes initially constructed with identical compositions, materials, construction dates, locations, and orientations. The thermal envelope of one home underwent rehabilitation using the ETICS, while the other remained in its original state. Continuous temperature recordings on the southern and northwestern facades of both homes were conducted using thermocouples over a 15-day period. The data analysis yielded insights into facade performance before and after this rehabilitation approach. The findings suggest that the implementation of ETICS results in more stable interior temperatures, significantly reducing indoor temperatures in comparison to outdoor conditions, leading to a notable decrease in heat energy loss. Consequently, this research underscores the tangible benefits of employing ETICS in building rehabilitation, emphasizing its role as a passive energy-saving strategy. By demonstrating the positive impact on thermal performance and energy efficiency, this study reinforces the vital connection between research endeavors and sustainability objectives. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This paper analyses data from the real estate market domain. The data were scraped from the bezrealitky.cz portal. The analysis looks at both sales and rental data. A total of 3546 records and 54 attributes were obtained. A basic overview of the data was performed using exploratory data analysis where some basic characteristics of the data were identified, such as the average price of sold and rented flats. More specific results were obtained by applying data mining methods such as regression (linear regression, lasso regression and ridge regression) for predicting the flat prices and payments for utilities, classification (support vector machines, KNN, Gaussian naïve Bayes, decision tree and random forest) for estimating the PENB class (building energy performance certificate) and building condition. Lasso regression performed the most successfully (R2 = 0.76) in predicting the rent price. Among the classification tasks, the best result was achieved with random forest, which had an accuracy over 80% in some cases. Other tasks included clustering (k-means and k-modes) and anomaly detection (isolation forest). The main focus was on descriptive data mining, especially on clustering. Clusters created using the k-means algorithm (silhouette score of 0.78) with flats based on geographic coordinates were identified which show that the most expensive flats are on average in Bohemian regions, followed by Silesia and the cheapest are in central Moravia. Another cluster application identified flats in the Moravian-Silesian region with very high payments for utilities (silhouette score of 0.56). The models can help estimate the value of flats based on their attributes as well as location. Copyright: © 2023 by the author(s).

AB  - The 2022 natural gas price spikes across Europe raised concerns regarding their distributional consequences. This paper investigates the distributional effect of price increases between and, in particular, within different income groups in Germany, accounting for different determinants of gas expenditures. The study finds that low-income households are affected the most by the gas price increase. Low-income households pay, at the median, 11.70 percent of their equivalent income for natural gas, while high-income households pay, at the median, 2.41 percent. Moreover, natural gas expenditures are higher for tenants in detached houses and in houses without double glazing or thermal insulation. Our policy analysis shows that a well-targeted subsidy scheme can be more effective at reducing inequality and less costly than a subsidy for all households. Additionally, the introduction of a minimum energy efficiency standard for buildings can help reduce inequality in the medium term. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The building industry significantly contributes to global warming, driving the demand for sustainable construction and green buildings. However, barriers like cost concerns and limited knowledge persist. Previous studies have used multi-objective optimization (MOO) to minimize life cycle cost and environmental impact, often emphasizing energy efficiency. In equatorial climates, unique factors like material selection must be considered. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of sustainable materials, focusing on envelope materials in Ecuador. The case study is a single-family house in the equatorial climate, optimized using Building Information Modeling (BIM), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA). In this study, a MOO process using the weighted sum approach (WSA) identifies sustainable house designs. The sustainable houses achieve a 98% decrease in Ozone Depletion Potential, a 75% reduction in Global Warming Potential, and a 45% drop in Primary Energy Demand, although they still incur a 30% increased cost. The results offer a foundation for cost-effective, eco-friendly housing solutions. Bamboo emerges as a promising material with local acceptance. This research highlights the significance of material selection in sustainable construction and provides a replicable approach for diverse settings. It aims to promote sustainable housing solutions in Ecuador and beyond. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Small commercial buildings are the most energy-intensive and represent nearly three-forth of the building stock in the United States. In the current market, analytic tools used to examine energy savings in building systems rely on data-rich environments by extensive monitoring of smart meters, and equipment health and are often used for larger commercial buildings. In-person audits are expensive and large real estate portfolios with small commercial buildings with limited data sets pose a unique opportunity to drive significant energy and cost savings. The authors have been studying energy consumption patterns of two large commercial portfolios of small commercial buildings of roughly 10,000 facilities that are under 10000 square feet with limited data sets and leveraged the combination of change point modeling, coupled with visual inspection and feature creation from simple controller data to diagnose the change in overtime energy consumption patterns, identify nuances and benchmark building performance in the portfolio. The work here can be used as a means of online audit for large portfolios for identification of energy efficiency measures to improve the individual building, and portfolio performance.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In contrast to the extensive research on the impact of green buildings on character, property values, energy efficiency, and environmental quality, less emphasis has been placed on understanding the factors driving users’ selection of green real estate projects, an essential element for the future business sustainability of such buildings. This study investigates the connection between various user motivations, such as perceived usefulness, perceived usability, a sense of responsibility, awareness of consequences, and perceived behavioral control, and their impact on Asian users’ willingness to pay for green real estate projects. These users include those who have already invested in and are considering long-term investment in such projects. An empirical methodology, integrating these motivations with a technology acceptance model, is proposed to assess their willingness to pay either through renting or buying. The study applies structural equation modeling to analyze sample data against a hypothetical model, thereby testing the hypotheses. It concludes that, in influencing green real estate projects, the following apply: (1) perceived usefulness and perceived behavioral control significantly shape Asian users’ attitudes towards financial commitment; (2) perceived usability directly influences their perceived usefulness; (3) awareness of consequences acts as a mediating factor in the relationship between perceived usability and behavioral control among these users. Moreover, the study offers strategic design recommendations for future green real estate projects, informed by the diverse motivational factors of Asian users, to guide their purchasing and selection decisions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Urban cities have a great potential for the sewage wastewater (WW) and treated WW but this heat resource is still underutilised in many European cities, including the three Baltic capitals of Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the integration of waste heat (WH) into a district heating (DH) system via absorption heat pumps by using key performance indicators (KPIs) in the fields of energy, environment, economy and social sphere in the three Baltic capitals. The paper presents a three-step methodology that develops an innovative multi-dimensional approach to energy poverty analysis and includes the three main drivers of energy poverty: fuel prices, household income, and energy efficiency. The paper shows that the integration of WH is economically feasible from the consumer's point of view and reduces energy poverty, especially when the price of fuel increases. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The decarbonisation policies for the EU building stock can improve living conditions, including thermal comfort and lower energy bills. However, these measures may impose financial burdens on low-income households, reducing their disposable income and exacerbating their vulnerability. The current study investigates the impact of decarbonisation policies on the EU’s building stock, with a specific focus on Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS), the new Emissions Trading System (ETS2) for buildings, and the phase-out of fossil heating systems. By employing a linear, static latest version of Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365)-based model and analyzing Eurostat data, this study quantifies the effects of these policies on energy consumption, costs, and necessary investments. Moreover, the study emphasizes their implications for low-income groups using vulnerability indicators. The findings demonstrate that a combination of MEPs, ETS2, and phasing out fossil heating systems effectively reduces energy consumption and costs across most countries. However, implementing ETS2 alone may lead to energy reduction and discomfort for low-income groups without addressing underlying demand-side issues. To address this, this study recommends the implementation of more ambitious MEPs or the provision of additional funding alongside ETS2. The phase-out of fossil fuel boilers emerges as the most cost-effective measure in the medium to long term. While MEPS and the phase-out of fossil fuel boilers improve living conditions, they also impose upfront cost burdens and reduce disposable income for low-income households. Therefore, high subsidy rates and supportive policies are necessary to ensure equitable access to investments. The main recommendations include (a) shifting financing to renewable heating systems for low-income households by 2025, addressing cost issues and policies favouring gas boilers; (b) implementing high-funding rate subsidies for energy efficiency in low-income households before 2025, with technical guidance; (c) prioritising the Energy Efficiency First principle in planning to avoid additional emissions or higher costs for low-income households; and (d) considering the energy behaviour of low-income groups in regulations, employing a combination of policies to achieve desired outcomes and ensure thermal comfort. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The urgency to address climate change and its devastating consequences has never been more pressing. As societies become increasingly aware of the detrimental impact of traditional housing on the planet, there is a growing demand for eco-friendly housing solutions that prioritize energy efficiency, resource conservation and reduced carbon emissions. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the factors that influence customers’ priority toward eco-friendly house purchasing intention. Design/methodology/approach: This study collected 386 data using a quantitative research strategy and purposive sampling method. This study uses a hybrid analysis technique using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approaches to identify the influencing factors. Findings: The PLS-SEM analysis found that attitude toward the eco-friendly house, subjective norms, performance expectancy, environmental knowledge and environmental sensitivity have a positive influence on eco-friendly house purchasing intention. However, perceived behavioral control and willingness to pay were found to have insignificant effect on customers’ intention to purchase eco-friendly houses. The fsQCA results further revealed complex causal relationships between the influencing factors. Practical implications: This research will not only contribute to academic knowledge but also provide practical guidance to real estate developers, policymakers and individuals looking to make environmentally responsible choices. By understanding the factors that influence consumers’ intentions to purchase eco-friendly houses, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient future. Originality/value: This study has used a hybrid analysis technique, combining PLS-SEM and fsQCA, to enhance the predictive accuracy of eco-friendly house purchase intentions among individuals residing in densely populated and highly polluted developing countries, such as Bangladesh. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Corporate real estate management (CREM) is complex due to an increasing number of real estate (RE) added values and the tensions between them. RE managers are faced with trade-offs: to choose a higher performance for one added value at the cost of another. CREM research mainly deals with trade-offs in a hypothetical sense, without looking at the characteristics of the RE portfolio nor the specific context in which trade-offs are made. The purpose of this paper is to further develop the concept of real estate value (REV) optimisation with regard to tensions between decreasing CO2 emissions and supporting user activities. Design/methodology/approach: Mixed method study. REV optimisation between user activities and energy efficiency for police stations in the Netherlands built between 2000 and 2020 is analysed. This is complemented by interviews with an RE manager and senior user of police stations and analysis of policy documents. Findings: xThe characteristics of the police station portfolio indicate no correlation between user activities and energy efficiency for the case studied. This is complemented by interviews, from which it becomes clear that there was in fact little tension between supporting user activities and energy efficiency. The performances of these two different added values were optimised separately. Originality/value: This study combines different scales (building and portfolio level) with different types of data: portfolio analysis, document analysis and interviews. This creates a comprehensive image of whether and how the Netherlands police optimised the two RE values. © 2024, Daniël van Staveren, Monique Arkesteijn and Alexandra Den Heijer.

AB  - The low energy efficiency of the European building stock is both a social and environmental issue. However, plans and studies on energy retrofitting interventions do not usually evaluate the impact of these measures on households’ energy affordability. This paper analyses and compares the effect of alternative retrofitting strategies on thermal energy services’ affordability in Spanish vulnerable households. This analysis was carried out by applying the Required Thermal Energy Expenditure model proposed in previous studies to several 2030 residential building stock scenarios, setting 2020 as a baseline. Therefore, this work proposes a methodological approach to assess the impact of the considered energy efficiency interventions on energy poverty in winter (WEP) and summer (SEP) and carries out both a ‘social cost’ and a cost-benefit analysis. The dwelling's thermal-enclosure retrofitting stands out as a very WEP-reduction and social-cost effective measure. Instead, replacing old thermal systems with more efficient ones would have a higher impact on SEP. Combining both kinds of retrofitting measures could reduce heating and cooling required expenditures by, respectively, 49% and 59%, and decrease the WEP and SEP share, correspondingly, by 35% and 63%. These results might inform policymakers to enhance the targeting and design of energy efficiency programs. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Since 2012, the United States has witnessed explosive growth in mandatory energy efficiency disclosure policies, which aim to address market failures in housing. I examine one such policy and find increased capitalization of features that buyers are less likely to observe, but no impacts for features that buyers usually observe. A stan-dard deviation increase in less-observable energy efficiency corresponds to a $5,300 increase in house prices. A dollar of annual savings from less observable energy efficiency is associated with a $19 increase in house prices due to the policy. This trans-lates to none-to-full capitalization of less-observable energy efficiency at discount rates upward of 5.6%. My findings suggest that policy makers can reduce administrative burdens by targeting disclosure of less observable energy efficiency features. Further-more, my findings call into question the usefulness of common instruments like the Home Energy Score for disclosure policies, as these mostly provide information on more observable features. © 2023 The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

AB  - The energy transition and decarbonisation require a major transformation of the housing stock. Responsible for around 40% of fossil fuel consumption and 30% of CO2 emissions, the built heritage must be upgraded in terms of energy performance. The issue is particularly sensitive for Italy, where seven out of ten homes are in the worst energy classes according to the classification introduced by the EU. The research aimed at investigating whether, and to what extent, energy-efficient homes command a premium price on the market compared to less efficient homes. The study focused on three medium-sized cities in northern Italy and developed three hedonic models based on more than 900 ask prices. The results confirm the stratification of the market in terms of energy efficiency levels. Estimates converge in absolute and relative terms between different cities. Particularly significant is the average gap found between properties in the highest efficiency class (Class A) and those in the lowest efficiency class (Class G), with values of around thirty percentage points, while the gap is around fourteen percentage points if we consider properties in Class D compared to Class G. The conclusions are in line with European studies on the subject, but show a trend towards an increasing gap between the market values of properties with different energy performance classes. © 2023, Dei Tipografia del Genio Civile.

AB  - Cloud computing is a fast emerging utility-oriented paradigm providing services to a large number of users across World Wide Web based on spend-as-per-yourutilization model. To offer its users computational services, data centers eat up a lot of energy. Such excessive consumption of power by those virtualized data centers has increased the operating cost of cloud environment for both cloud service provider as well as for intended user. Normally, a typical data center wipes out energy which generally equals to energy consumption of 25000 houses. Along with increasing cost, it also degrades the environment badly by emitting large amount of carbon dioxide gas and thus becoming one of the major causes for environmental issues like global warming and green house effects. In this research paper, the proposed technique not only trying to meet energy efficiency requirement but will also prevent the breaching of Service Level Agreement (SLA) and thus provide cloud users with Quality of Service (QOS). © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Arvind Dagur, Karan Singh, Pawan Singh Mehra & Dhirendra Kumar Shukla; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - The energy efficiency course is an important component of the sustainable development of countries, ensuring the solution of a set of tasks: saving energy resources; involving business in the environmental agenda; changing construction norms and rules; optimizing the characteristics of industrial, commercial, and non-commercial real estate objects, considering the requirements for saving resources (energy, heat, water, etc.) and the use of energy-efficient materials; increasing responsibility for the efficient use of resources; supporting energy saving initiatives in the society; forming new consumption patterns. The research aims to systematize and evaluate the directions of including the principles of energy conservation and energy efficiency in the elements of the public procurement mechanism. The research methods include the analysis of Russian and international practices (USA, China, EU, and Japan) of the inclusion of public procurement in the implementation of national development programs and strategies, including the solution of energy efficiency problems. As a result, the research identifies the main components in the subjects of contracts, the customers of which are state and municipal institutions of different sectors of the economy (educational, medical, cultural and leisure, sports, social service and protection institutions, etc.): replacement of non-energy efficient appliances and indoor lighting, modernization of heating, water supply, and sanitation, installation of automatic systems accounting and control over the consumption of various resources in buildings and infrastructure facilities, and modernization of street lighting in cities and other localities. The original conclusion is made that public expenditure savings and the implementation of the dominant energy saving in terms of solving technical, economic, and socially significant tasks allow us to testify to the effects of improving public procurement management and the development of energy, construction, and other industries. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: In Lebanon, poultry production is one of the major components of the agricultural sector; however, it suffers from increasing energy costs necessary to cover poultry heating requirements. This affects the profits of brooding farms, namely, small-scale farms in rural areas. Few studies have addressed the use of renewable energy in the poultry industry in Lebanon, with most having focused on modelling ventilation and air quality requirements in poultry houses. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the efficiency of renewable energy sources in providing heating requirements for poultry production. Accordingly, this study evaluates the performance of a solar-assisted, localized heating system in providing heat requirements for chicks in a renovated green poultry house in the Bekaa semi-arid rural region in Lebanon. For this aim, two brooding cycles were conducted during the warm and cold seasons in a greenhouse and were later replicated in a conventional poultry house. Results: The energy inputs in the green and conventional houses, respectively, were 33,995.39 and 40,656.97 MJ (1000 birds)−1 in the warm season, and 37,058.25 and 45,770.05 MJ (1000 birds)−1 in the cold season. Calculated energy efficiency values for the green and conventional poultry houses were, respectively, 0.58 and 0.50 in the warm season, and 0.46 and 0.41 in the cold season. The net return was negative for both systems and the benefit-to-cost ratio from broiler production was calculated to be 0.49 and 0.50 in the green and conventional houses, respectively. Life cycle cost analysis showed that adopting the green heating system in the studied farm would entail an 18.89% increase in cost over a period of 20 years as compared to the conventional system. Conclusion: It was concluded that poultry production is not profitable in small-scale farms in the studied area in Lebanon. The use of renewable energy might be more suited for large-scale broiler operations to achieve their purpose in reducing overall production costs. Optimization of the green system to fully satisfy the poultry energy requirements would render it more economically competitive. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Despite persistent housing affordability issues, energy policy and housing renovation are usually investigated separately from housing costs other than energy. Researchers have examined the financial viability of renovation attending to building conditions and the socio-economic characteristics of their occupants. However, the distributional impacts of renovation incentives and the potential of fiscal policy to redistribute housing costs remain understudied. Dutch fiscal policy, favouring homeownership, offers a relevant context to evaluate how property taxation can boost renovation rates. The novelty of this paper resides in investigating the impact of two policies, the current direct subsidy and a proposal for a green tax, on both the financial viability of renovation and the subsequent distribution of housing costs. The proposed green tax combines energy efficiency and taxation of property revenue. We employ a model considering marginal costs of housing renovation, obtained from a government dataset, and marginal benefits, drawn from a hedonic regression. We assess the distributional impacts of different policy scenarios by examining changes in user costs across income deciles. Our findings indicate that existing renovation subsidies exacerbate the regressive distributional impacts resulting from the current housing taxation system in the Netherlands. Introducing energy-efficiency-linked property taxation can make homeownership fiscality less regressive while incentivising housing renovation.

AB  - This paper addresses the deep renovation and enhancement of energy efficiency in existing urban areas, aiming to transform them into zero energy districts, utilizing renewable sources. This transformative process is essential to align with contemporary models for new buildings and to elevate existing structures to meet environmental housing standards mandated by current regulations. The proposed densification strategy is motivated by the necessity to augment the real estate value and enhance the architectural and performance quality of the existing building stock, all while minimizing additional land occupation. Its efficacy has been rigorously tested and demonstrated within the European Horizon 2020 project “ABRACADABRA”. The key actions advocated for in this approach revolve around the incorporation of renewable energies, volumetric expansion, and completion volumes (urban infill), within the Positive Energy District. The validation of this process occurs on a district scale in a social housing urban block located in Bologna (Italy), with currently poor environmental performance. A multi-criteria analysis was employed to examine the architectural, climatic, and energy context. The meta-design phase successfully attained the energy and economic targets set by the project and by local and European regulations settings, offering an optimized design solutions for reshaping the built environment. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Cities are complex and constantly evolving systems where changing social needs have always reshaped the built environment. Considering recent evolutionary trends in housing emergencies, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, and environmental sustainability goals, a rethinking of the building heritage is fundamental. This article aims to promote the conversion of buildings designed initially for nonresidential uses as a process and project strategy based on energy efficiency and a holistic and integrated vision of the circular economy. The methodological approach is based on two main phases: definition of evaluative parameters for the potential reuse of a building, and integration of the evaluation system in a BIM and GIS environment. The result is a tool for rapid automatic pre-evaluation of the potential conversion of a building into a residential space. Applying the developed methodology allows for a practical approach to the significant issue of sustainable construction, with particular attention to energy improvement and the reduction of environmental impact related to the construction of new buildings. The originality of the contribution lies in the systematization of various digital technologies to provide fundamental support for managing and transforming the varied and widespread unused real estate assets in a state of abandonment and degradation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Aim: This paper presents an ongoing study on sustainability transitions in the Norwegian construction sector, with a focus on increasing the use of wood. The construction sector is very conservative and path dependent. Existing pathdependencies and lock-mechanisms are interrelated and reinforce each other, contributing to an unsustainable development within the sector and preventing a sustainable transformation. These interacting lock-ins create social problems, such as the lack of affordable city dwellings, a high cost for energy efficiency and renovation measures, and less flexibility for adapting dwelling spaces to new needs. A crucial question is therefore how to change pathdependencies and overcome these interacting lock-ins by developing new pathways what types of actors and efforts are required for such a change In this paper, we pay attention to the specific role of different types of intermediary organisations in the transition to a more sustainable construction sector in Norway. We investigate how such intermediaries contribute to more sustainable pathways in the construction sector, with a focus on the use of wood.

AB  - Parks are important solutions to urban heat challenges given their potential for cool island effects. Observation and assessment of park cooling performance are important for providing urban planners, designers, and managers with fundamental information for accurate decisions relevant to park planning, design, construction, and maintenance. This paper presents a review of sensing-based park cooling performance studies, aiming to i) understand the research evolution of sensing-based park cooling studies, ii) reveal the emergence and advancement of sensing techniques, iii) analyze park cooling assessment methods and indicators, iv) document the spatiotemporal variations of park cooling performance, v) explore key factors affecting cooling performance, and vi) discuss the research gaps and practical shortcomings, and propose suggestions for addressing them. The results indicate that sensing techniques enhance researchers’ capacity to observe park cooling performance, as evidenced by the rapid increase in publications, research areas, source journals, and leading nations. Sensing-based park cooling studies were shaped as sensing-based techniques for understanding environmental sciences relevant to ecology and forestry, thereby improving the technology implementation capacity for better urban construction and management. The cooling performance can be assessed by the cooling distance, cooling intensity, cooling strength, cooling area, cooling efficiency, and cooling gradient. These indicators were further linked to cooling service accessibility, building energy efficiency, house prices, and social equality. However, the terminology and definitions of such indicators in many studies were mixed, and the assessment methods were not unified, reducing the comparability, robustness, and reliability of the results. However, existing studies have widely demonstrated spatial homogeneity, spatial heterogeneity, and temporal trends in park cooling performance, with some studies presenting contradictory results. Moreover, park cooling performance could be affected by many factors in geographic, climatic, urban development, weather, sampling, methodological, geometric, spatial, and vegetational aspects. To avoid ignoring some explainable variables, we suggest that it is important to describe influential factors, assessment methods, and assessment indicators for accurate, reliable, and comparable cooling performance. Overall, this study provides a reference for comprehensively understanding sensing-based park cooling performance observation and assessment, and it enlightens researchers to understand the methodological significance of park cooling performance assessments. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper estimates the effect of the closure and relocation of chemical enterprises along the Yangtze River on housing prices in China. With a difference-in-differences (DiD) model and detailed data on polluting enterprises, house transactions, and environmental complaints, we find that environmental regulation led to a 1.7% increase in housing prices and a 43.3% reduction in perceived environmental risks, as measured by environmental complaints from surrounding residents. In addition, we observe a greater change in property values among taller buildings than among shorter buildings. This paper elucidates how developing countries can benefit from environmental regulation by influencing residents’ risk perceptions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - A lack of specificity exists on whether likely homebuyers utilize home energy efficiency information in future home searches. This study addresses this gap using a visual choice experiment to sample 1538 intended homebuyers in the USA, and the preference for home attributes through a simplified real estate website. Each home presented on the website featured six attributes: price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, number of days on the market, energy efficiency, and a photo — each relative to participants’ initial specification of location, preferred price, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The respondents were assigned to one of six experimental conditions where energy information was provided as (i) estimated annual energy costs, (ii) home energy score (number only), (iii) home energy score along a continuum, (iv) estimated annual energy costs and energy score along a continuum, (v) home energy scores provided for only above average homes, and (vi) no energy information provided (control). We find that homebuyers are more likely to select energy efficient homes when presented with any form of energy efficiency information, with conditions that include home energy scores providing the greatest increase in energy efficiency. Furthermore, this preference for energy efficiency information persists even under less-than-ideal home searches. The preference for energy efficient homes is influenced by type of home and region with detached homebuyers and homebuyers in the Midwest US Census region more likely to select homes featuring higher energy efficiency scores. Finally, we find that rural homebuyers are more likely to prefer energy efficient homes over urban homebuyers. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The existing building stock faces the challenge of low energy efficiency and requires renovation and upgrading to meet society′s goals of carbon reduction and sustainable development. This study presents an optimization framework utilizing genetic algorithms to develop robust retrofit plans that balance the need for improved energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness considerations for householders, and uncertainties regarding climate conditions. A case study of an aged residential building in a hot and humid region of China is used to demonstrate the proposed method. The optimization results show a potential energy demand reduction of 81.5%. However, due to the relatively long time required to realize economic benefits from high investments, short-term optimization tends to favor solutions with high energy demand and low primary costs. To effectively reduce carbon emissions, it is recommended to consider the long-term economic benefits of retrofits and prioritize solutions with high energy efficiency. However, it is important to acknowledge that the expensive nature of retrofit investments may pose barriers to residents. Society should provide adequate support and guidance to facilitate residential renovation efforts. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The paper examines the relationship between natural resource growth, green economy growth, and energy intensity levels in achieving environmentally friendly economic growth in Asian countries. It analyzes the connections among the number of natural resources, institutional capacity, trade liberalization, and foreign direct investment in China from 2010 to 2022. The study concludes that economies flourish when countries utilize organic and synthetic energy sources, and natural resources can stimulate or impede economic development. A radical adjustment in real estate policies is required to address the growing urgency of reversing environmental degradation and combating climate change. Integration of renewable energy sources, optimization of natural resource usage, and the use of novel financial instruments and investment techniques emerge as pressing needs. The research focuses on whether eco-friendly company practices are associated with long-term economic success in Asian countries. It evaluates the impact of energy intensity on GDP growth and emphasizes the importance of a green economy in promoting sustainable economic growth. The study suggests governments should prioritize improving energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy sources, and supporting environmentally friendly industries for long-term prosperity. The paper highlights the need for Asian authorities to balance rapid economic progress with minimizing negative environmental and natural resource impacts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The research aims to study the influence of eco-efficient buildings by comparing their designs according to energy efficiency criteria and optimization considering scenarios with traditional construction systems. The proposed methodology shows that eco-efficient building projects comply with environmental and sustainable strategies for the expansion of height with floors. Previous technical characteristics and parameters are considered, and these are divided into three main areas: water, energy, and inputs, in addition to a secondary area: housing density. The evaluation that was carried out showed that the water consumption parameter is the most expensive to manage for any construction company and tends to be very irregular in its percentage of compliance, since it depends on the customs of the inhabitants. The energy parameter is considered a complex aspect, since the use of private transport is expected to decrease. However, due to the customs and structures of cities, this is difficult to change without comprehensive public policies. This implies that apartment sales decrease when there are no available parking spaces. On the other hand, the contribution parameter, regardless of the construction company, always remains constant due to the economic investment required and international regulations. Finally, the housing density is always met with the same percentage due to the amount of user occupancy in the buildings. The planning of the cities in Ecuador is currently part of a sustainable development, and the instruments and policies involved are shaped by the real estate sector and, with it, urban development. Thus, by starting from a definition of nature and going through a description of the regulations and public policies until specific cases in architecture are reached, the application of sustainable development in the real estate sector is shown. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, numerous studies have explored how energy and environmental performance impact property values. Superior energy efficiency is the basis for value disparities in real estate markets. However, measurements of these variations vary significantly. This research aims to investigate the relationship between market size and vitality and market value differences. This has significant implications for the nature of the energy transition, potentially determining fairness or inequality. The study considers the real estate market in six Italian cities: three metropolitan (Milan, Turin, and Florence) and three medium-sized cities (Padua, Mestre, and Bergamo). The sample includes 2935 properties. In metropolitan cities, hedonic pricing models confirm the relevance of energy performance in market value formation, highlighting a potential depreciation in property values by up to 30% between properties belonging to the highest energy class (A) compared to the lowest (G), and 14% between class D and G. Such premium gaps are halved in medium-sized cities. Conclusions foresee a scenario of socially and economically unjust transition that must be considered in policies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings, with a specific concern for the nature and characteristics of the real estate markets involved. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Rising energy prices threaten households' access to affordable energy services and increase the risk of energy vulnerability. One way to reduce the cost of access to energy is to implement energy efficiency measures at the household level (e.g. solar panels). However, not all households have the capacity to do this. Households that are unable to implement energy efficiency measures are vulnerable in two ways: 1) they may not enjoy the benefits of these measures (such as lower energy costs, healthier and more comfortable living conditions), and 2) they may face increasing costs due to fluctuating market prices for non-renewable energy sources or taxes on non-renewable energy sources. Although public authorities use different policy instruments to support citizens in implementing energy efficiency measures, it turns out that these policy instruments can (re)produce energy vulnerability in an uneven way. However, how exactly this happens remains unclear. The aim of this paper is to use the capability approach to identify mechanisms that explain how policy instruments (re)produce energy vulnerability. By combining three qualitative methods to analyse two Dutch neighbourhoods, this article illustrates how institutional arrangements affect capabilities unequally, depending on spatial scale, language skills, socio-economic characteristics and housing situation. Finally, it presents three subsequent mechanisms through which policy instruments may negatively affect citizens' capabilities and increase the risk of energy vulnerability: 1) by precluding citizens from relevant information about the energy transition; 2) by raising the thresholds for citizens to implement energy-efficient measures; and 3) by miscalculating policy consequences, i.e. citizens' poor anticipation of long-term policy implications, aggravated by legal and financial uncertainty or changing individual circumstances. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The energy efficiency optimization of Florida's residential buildings is essential for the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This optimization requires designers to accurately calculate the building energy loads at the design stage to efficiently design the cooling and heating systems. However, due to time and cost constraints, designers usually explore only a few design alternatives and simulate their energy use. This study developed an artificial-neural-network (ANN)-based generative design (GD) framework to automate the design process of detached residences while optimizing their energy performance. The ANN model was developed using the machine learning platform TensorFlow and some Python-based Keras libraries based on a big data set of about 17,000 newly constructed detached residences in Florida between the years 2009 and 2021. The GD framework was established using Autodesk Dynamo and the Autodesk Revit GD add-on that uses the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), in which multiple design parameters mainly relating to the house geometry and its energy performance were incorporated. Considering 10 independent variables, including the total wall area, roof area, floor area, and the windows' U-value, the ANN model predicted the required capacities of the cooling and heating systems in detached houses, with R2 values of 0.955 and 0.904, respectively. The ANN then was integrated within the GD framework for performance evaluation purposes. The findings of this study resulted in a fully automated 3-min design process of an energy-efficient detached house envelope, maximizing the productivity of designers and developers and greatly reducing the financial strain and time consumed using traditional techniques.  © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Purpose: The current literature on energy certificates shows that Energy Performance Certificate labels have an important effect on real estate prices. However, interestingly, the limited studies that address the rental market find significantly lower price premiums than the sales market. The purpose of this paper is to add to this literature, by doing a comparative analysis of price premiums in the sales and rental market in Flanders (Belgium). Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a hedonic regression model to analyze 177,670 real estate listings between 2016 and 2021. The data is provided by Immoweb – the largest online real estate platform in Belgium. The data set was divided in sold and rented properties: the authors evaluated 126,217 sales listings and 51,453 rent listings. Findings: The results confirm that energy efficient properties generate a price premium, but that this premium is significantly larger in the sales market than in the rental market. In addition, the findings indicate that both investors and landlords could benefit strongly from renovating dwellings – especially when renovating from an F label to an A label. Originality/value: Previous research focuses strongly on the sales market, although in many countries the rental market is similar in size and responsible from much energy consumption. Interestingly, the few studies that are addressing the rental market, find singificantly smaller price premiums than in the sales market. The findings add to this literature tradition and offer a comparative analysis of price premiums in the sales and rental market in Flanders. This allows us to not only show the similarities between both markets but also highlight the differences – creating valuable insights for academia, governments and real estate professionals. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A model was used to simulate and optimise a speculative district heating (DH) system for an existing urban area in Loughborough, UK. Heat was supplied using only renewable heat sources (RHS) with long and short duration thermal energy storage (TES) systems used to address mismatch between heat generation and demand. For an 18-month simulation period, a) building heat loads, b) heat generated, c) heat flow to and from stores, and d), heat losses from the stores and network were calculated using hourly weather data, network and building characteristics. RHS included evacuated-tube solar thermal collectors (ETSTCs), and ground and air source heat pumps powered by electricity generated by solar-photovoltaic (PV) and Wind turbines (Wind). The effect of long-term TES system volume and charging temperature on the calculated DH system cost per dwelling, and the calculated DH system energy efficiency was assessed. The minimum cost of the DH system was obtained by modifying the capacity of installed Wind and PV, while ensuring that heat demands were met in every hour of the simulation. A minimum cost per dwelling of £12,278 was predicted with an energy efficiency of 84.84 % for a long term TES volume of 15,000 m3 and temperature of 60 °C. © 2023

AB  - Hydrogen has recently been proposed as a versatile energy carrier to contribute to archiving universal access to clean cooking. In hard-to-reach rural settings, decentralized produced hydrogen may be utilized (i) as a clean fuel via direct combustion in pure gaseous form or blended with Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG), or (ii) via power-to-hydrogen-to-power (P2H2P) to serve electric cooking (e-cooking) appliances. Here, we present the first techno-economic evaluation of hydrogen-based cooking solutions. We apply mathematical optimization via energy system modeling to assess the minimal cost configuration of each respective energy system on technical and economic measures under present and future parameters. We further compare the potential costs of cooking for the end user with the costs of cooking with traditional fuels. Today, P2H2P-based e-cooking and production of hydrogen for utilization via combustion integrated into the electricity supply system have almost equal energy system costs to simultaneously satisfy the cooking and electricity needs of the isolated rural Kenyan village studied. P2H2P-based e-cooking might become advantageous in the near future when improving the energy efficiency of e-cooking appliances. The economic efficiency of producing hydrogen for utilization by end users via combustion benefits from integrating the water electrolysis into the electricity supply system. More efficient and cheaper hydrogen technologies expected by 2050 may improve the economic performance of integrated hydrogen production and utilization via combustion to be competitive with P2H2P-based e-cooking. The monthly costs of cooking per household may be lower than the traditional use of firewood and charcoal even today when applying the current life-line tariff for the electricity consumed or utilizing hydrogen via combustion. Driven by likely future technological improvements and the expected increase in traditional and fossil fuel prices, any hydrogen-based cooking pathway may be cheaper for end users than using charcoal and firewood by 2030, and LPG by 2040. The results suggest that providing clean cooking in rural villages could economically and environmentally benefit from utilizing hydrogen. However, facing the complexity of clean cooking projects, we emphasize the importance of embedding the results of our techno-economic analysis in holistic energy delivery models. We propose useful starting points for future aspects to be investigated in the discussion section, including business and financing models. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to examine the awareness of the inhabitants regarding energy consumption in relation to comfort in Tlemcen and analyze the paths of influence and the effects of individual objective and subjective characteristic factors. This determines the factors' level of perception of the importance of energy retrofitting. Design/methodology/approach: As part of an exploratory empirical study, this paper further discusses accompanied survey data from a sample of 208 properties, through a triangulation of in-depth qualitative studies and quantitative studies developed and analyzed by SPSS software (the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Findings: Analysis of the results of the survey shows that the respondents have a level of awareness on comfort linked to energy savings but they lack guidance and recourse to specialists. The conclusion is that resident awareness is crucial and beneficial and that the key socio-demographic characteristics to determine the perception factors are related to age, occupation, household size and time lived in the house. Originality/value: By exploring some of the key insights from the survey, this research improves residents' perception of the importance of energy retrofitting in the residential sector, highlighting the importance of priorities. This influences public attitudes and contributes to raising awareness in order to provide useful results for developing, in future studies, motivational strategies for these inhabitants. The present research is expected to add value to existing studies academically and methodologically and provide policy guidance to policy makers and other energy efficiency (EE) practitioners in the Maghreb region and beyond. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Given the significance of carbon emissions from the existing building stock, this paper aims to provide an international comparative analysis of pioneering policies on minimum energy efficiency standards in the Scottish, English/Welsh, Dutch and French commercial real estate sectors. These are the four national policy regimes to employ these policy instruments to date with varied timelines spanning from 2009 to 2050. The methodological approach employs a document review of policy texts produced by policy makers and other stakeholders. The four policy regimes are evaluated in terms of their policy design focussing on minimum performance standards, forward guidance, scope and exemptions. A key finding is that, given the range of intervening factors, side-effects and uncertainties, there are difficult choices in striking a balance between phasing implementation, providing forward guidance and adjusting policy in response to evaluation. Whilst it was initially expected that most European Union jurisdictions would default to an Energy Performance Certificate related standard, our findings show that there has been a shift towards standards that are linked to actual rather than modelled energy consumption. However, for leased stock where the owner may have limited operational control, the separation of owners' responsibility for compliance and the users’ responsibility for operations makes designing consumption-based instruments more challenging. It is concluded that a central issue in policy design has been the trade-off between minimising the financial costs to property owners and occupiers of complying with performance thresholds and maximising reductions in energy consumption. There is growing recognition that regulatory economies of scale may be achieved by targeting large properties which allows for a large proportion of the total area of the stock to be covered whilst exempting a large proportion of transactions or properties. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - On the market where prospective renters meet dwelling offers, competitive forces and rational behavior on both sides would imply that the monthly basic rent should reflect differences in expected monthly heating costs – other things being equal. We test this hypothesis by specifying a hedonic price model reflecting a total-cost-of-renting perspective. Drawing on 844,229 apartment listings for rent from 2014 to 2020 on a small spatial scale, we find a premium for more energy-efficient apartments; however, it is rather small. If the energy performance score decreases by 10 kWh/m2a, the monthly basic rent increases, on average, by roughly €0.01 per square meter living area. The expected energy cost savings thereby exceed the premium by a factor of three to seven. Rather, we find discounts of up to 9.2 % if apartments use heating technologies that are known to be inefficient. We explore various explanations for these outcomes, considering both landlord and renter behavior. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) is a real estate investment trust that is based in Singapore and focuses on commercial properties. MCT owns and manages a diversified portfolio of assets that includes office buildings, business parks, and retail malls across Singapore. MCT faced the challenge of low stakeholder awareness and understanding of sustainability. It tackled this challenge by engaging its stakeholders in various sustainability activities. Another challenge faced by MCT was to improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. Energy efficiency is an important aspect of sustainability, as it helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower operating costs, and enhance occupant comfort and productivity. MCT also implemented waste reduction initiatives to minimise the amount of waste generated and disposed of by its properties. By implementing these waste reduction initiatives, MCT demonstrated its commitment to being a responsible and environmentally friendly organisation that cares about the well-being of its tenants, customers, and communities. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Leon Choong, Easwaramoorthy Rangaswamy, Ian Jamieson, and Annie-Marie Kilday; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Energy efficient buildings can facilitate the achievement of sustainable development goals. However, higher investment costs are not conducive to the development of energy efficient buildings. It is not clear whether the energy efficiency of buildings (EEBs) bring price premiums that could offset the incremental costs of adopting green practice. In this paper, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is constructed that takes into account the differences in regional and urban size to measure the EEBs in 54 cities of China during 2007–2018. We evaluate the influence of EEBs on price premiums by using fixed effects regression. We then adopt a moderated mediation model to explore the impact of industrial structure and the regional economic development level on this premium effect. The empirical results show that the cities’ EEBs is gradually improving, due to the fact that the level of technical progress in residential construction is rising. A 1% increase in house energy efficiency causes price premiums of 0.583%. Moreover, this premium effect is more obvious in cities with a high proportion of tertiary industries and economically developed areas. Considering energy consumption in household heating, the housing prices expectations were pulled down in heating cities, while the situation was reversed in non-heating cities. This study provides companies and governments with scientific evidence to promote EEBs. © 2023

AB  - Retrofitting existing buildings is crucial for achieving Net Zero emissions. Institutional real estate owners play a key role because of their significant ownership, especially of large buildings. We utilize an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate cost-optimal decarbonization conditions for three Swiss real estate portfolios owned by a global institutional investor. We leverage a bottom-up optimization framework for building asset retrofitting, scaled to the portfolio-level, to study the effect of policy scenarios and implementations. Results indicate that achieving Net Zero necessitates significant investments, largely through thermal energy efficiency measures and low-CO2 energy systems, as early as possible to avoid locked-in emissions. Owners will be challenged to smooth long-term capital investments, pointing to a potential liquidity crisis. Consequently, hard-to-decarbonize assets are unable to reach regulatory benchmarks largely because of lingering embodied emissions. To lower transition risk, we recommend that policymakers move toward average CO2 benchmarks at the real estate portfolio-level, emulating automotive fleets. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - It has been proven that the artificial environment of the economic system of territorial communities for the reconstruction of industrial facilities after their damage must be recreated with the help of anti-crisis management with the use of BI-technologies in business processes. Digital tools and platforms of anticrisis management of territorial communities are grouped under projects of reconstruction of production facilities. The Information Modeling Strategy of Anti-Crisis Management of Territorial Communities for Targeted Investment of Real Estate Reconstruction Projects is presented. The field of information modelling of anti-crisis management based on the description of business processes supported by investments has been studied. The national investment program of projects for the reconstruction of production facilities of Ukraine and the implementation of a large-scale energy efficiency program in the country in the postwar period is presented. Planned indicators of the riskiness of investing funds for the reconstruction of industrial facilities of territorial communities located of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, whose modernization is planned to be started by intermediaries of the Western region of Ukraine in the post-war period, are presented. The efficiency of the method of agglomerative hierarchical clustering for territorial communities is substantiated that will have a mixed type of introduction of BI-technologies in the anticrisis management of territorial communities aimed at serving the needs of consumers in the post-war period. Leader clusters have been determined by the effectiveness of using digital tools of CRM-systems and ERP-systems in anti-crisis management of territorial communities. © Economic Affairs (New Delhi).

AB  - Climate change threatens the established image and quality of life, carries risks for the real estate market, the construction industry, development projects, the existing real estate fund, as well as the economy. Despite the nature and scale of climate challenges, there are very few studies in Russia analyzing the economic effects of increasing the sustainability of buildings and cities. The authors of this particular study investigated the reasons for the current attitude to the problem and the expediency of investments in the field of improving the energy efficiency of modern buildings and capital repairs of the existing real estate fund. While preparing the material, the authors used a logical analysis of the Russian regulatory framework, methods for improving the energy efficiency of buildings in foreign countries; an economic analysis of the impact of improving the energy efficiency of buildings on the economics of projects, the construction industry, the Russian real estate market. The results of the study are that buildings with higher energy efficiency characteristics: they have greater resistance to current and predicted climate changes by experts. They also provide a higher quality of life and working environment; saving the consumed resources. They demonstrate a longer service life (while other things being equal) and a greater potential for cost growth over time. Each 1USD million investments in the field of energy efficiency improvement of new buildings and existing real estate fund leads to the creation of 13 to 15 new workplaces. This is the highest figure in comparison with other industries. The authors conclude that improving the energy efficiency of buildings is a necessary measure to increase the resilience of the real estate fund, Russian cities to climate risks and at the same time it is a guarantee of maintaining the competitiveness of Russian companies, the construction industry, the real estate market and the economy as a whole. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - In response to escalating environmental challenges, this research underscores the pivotal role of sustainable construction practices, particularly focusing on bioclimatic design as a foundational element within the realm of sustainable architecture and environmental upgrading of buildings, within the broader context of sustainable urban planning. The study delves into the perspectives of residents in Cyprus concerning bioclimatic building design. Employing a quantitative methodology, the investigation aims to comprehensively assess homeowner views on the benefits, motivations, concerns, and preferred techniques associated with bioclimatic design. By comprehending these perspectives and contextual factors, this study identifies obstacles hindering broader implementation and illuminates why adoption remains limited, despite the potential for substantial energy and emissions reductions. The research also examines the background of respondents, such as heating/cooling systems, energy expenses, and upgrade preferences, to provide essential context for the findings. A structured questionnaire was administered to a stratified sample of 150 pedestrians in the Pafos area, ensuring a representative cross-section of the local population. This method allowed for a robust examination of demographic influences on opinions and an in-depth analysis of the impact of residential characteristics. The findings reveal a substantial influence of cost considerations in shaping decisions related to residential property development and the renovation of existing structures, contributing to the limitation of widespread adoption across the island. This influence persists even as a majority of respondents express a readiness to undertake building energy upgrades, among which, the most popular actions include the installation of specialized glass, the replacement of traditional air conditioning units with inverters, and the adoption of energy-efficient lighting. The research culminates in the proposal that introducing financial incentives has the potential to enhance homeowner participation in bioclimatic and energy upgrades. This recommendation is particularly salient in the climatic context of Cyprus, where the implementation of solar control measures emerges as a promising avenue for bolstering energy efficiency. In considering the socio-economic dimensions implicit in these findings, it becomes evident that the interplay between financial considerations and sustainable construction practices is a critical aspect. The identified barriers underscore the necessity for nuanced strategies and policy frameworks that address the socio-economic dimensions of bioclimatic design adoption. In this context, the study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by shedding light on the intricate relationship between financial factors and sustainable architectural practices, offering implications for future research endeavors and potential avenues for policy interventions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Given its adaptable and efficient energy consuming devices during peak hours, the residential building sector is urged to take part in demand response (DR) initiatives with the use of a building energy management system (BMS). The residents of buildings with BMS enjoy secure, pleasant, and fully managed lifestyles. Although the BMS helps the building consume less energy and encourages occupant engagement in energy-saving initiatives, unwelcome interruptions and harsh instructions from the system are inconvenient for the inhabitants, which further discourages their participation in DR initiatives. Building automation control is a crucial factor for improving buildings’ energy efficiency and management, as well as improving the electricity grid’s reliability indices. Smart houses that use the right sizing procedure and energy-management techniques can help lower the demand on the entire grid and potentially sell clean energy to the utility. Recently, smart houses have been presented as an alternative to traditional power-system issues including thermal plant emissions and the risk of blackouts brought on by malfunctioning bulk plants or transmission lines. This paper describes the necessary technology requirements and presents the methodology and the decentralized building automation novel algorithm for efficient demand side management in a building management system. Human comfort aspects including thermal comfort and visual comfort were taken into consideration when selecting heating and lighting controls. The suggested BMS relies primarily on a load-shifting technique, which moves controllable loads to low-cost periods to avoid high loading during peak hours. The model aims to minimize the individual household electricity consumption cost while considering customers’ comfort and lifestyle. All these are applied in an experimental university microgrid, and the results are presented in terms of energy saving in kWh, money in €, and working hours. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach might successfully lower energy use during the DR period and enhance occupant comfort. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In one of the largest demand-side energy efficiency programs at the time, the Mexican government supported more than 11 million, mostly low-income households in replacing their old light bulbs and appliances with more efficient models. Previous evaluations of this program focused exclusively on appliances, which made up almost 90 per cent of the total program cost, and found modest benefits in terms of energy savings. This study compares the respective effects of replacing light bulbs and appliances simultaneously in a single econometric framework, using data from nationally representative household surveys and a difference-in-differences approach which exploits geographical variation in treatment intensities. Despite using different sources and types of data, our results for the appliances replacement intervention are largely in line with the estimates of previous studies. In addition, we find that the impact on energy consumption (proxied by the amount paid for electricity) of replacing light bulbs was of comparable magnitude as that of replacing appliances, although the average cost per participating household was much smaller. Overall, our results suggest that low-cost investments that help poor households reduce their energy consumption for lighting can have high returns on energy efficiency in the residential sector. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Increasing energy efficiency in residential buildings brings the social benefits of CO2 emissions reduction, increased energy security, reduced energy poverty and better public health, but is costly. The question arises as to who should pay for these social benefits: tenants, property owners, or society? The issues are complicated by the fact that the direct costs and benefits of energy-efficiency renovation are influenced by real estate markets. These market effects need to be better understood so that social costs, subsidies and CO2 taxes can be more fairly apportioned. As a case study, this paper investigates sales and rental market premiums for energy efficiency in 2019–2021 among the 6 million apartments in Germany that were built in 1800–1945, using a database from Germany's largest real estate portal. These apartments are notoriously energy inefficient, and their architecture and elegance can make energy-efficiency retrofitting difficult and expensive. Using least squares regression analyses, it finds that sales premiums for energy efficiency generally compensated owners who retrofitted then sold, were too low to compensate landlords/landladies for retrofitting, and too high for tenants or purchasers to offset through reduced energy consumption. The study asks how subsidies or CO2 taxes could help correct these market anomalies. Market premiums vary greatly by geography, suggesting that subsidies or taxes would need to vary by region. The relative stability of construction and energy prices in 2019–2021 make this a useful study of how different factors can interact to influence market premiums and set parameters for social subsidy and tax interventions. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The principal purpose of the current study is to provide building retrofitting methods in order to maximize the stored energy and minimize the dedicated budget for an initial investment as decision parameters. Also, the effects of using the proposed technology in heating and cooling the house, and costs have been evaluated. The optimization process has been used in order to create an optimal configuration of the recommended retrofit values in different cities of Spain, such as Malaga, Cordoba, Valencia, and Madrid. For solving the optimization issue a multi-objective CSO (chameleon swarm optimization) algorithm is employed. Reducing electricity consumption by replacing lighting features and refrigerator models, using insulating materials in exterior walls and windows to increase the U-values, using heat pumps for heating and cooling the building environment, using photovoltaics panels for personal use, including various measures that have been assumed for energy efficiency in the building. Various limitations that affect the cost are related to the volume of adherence to cooling and heating requirements, achieving demand, non-negative limitations related to parameters, and physical limitations of the building environment. Optimum replacements of retrofitting, calculation of saved energy, and budget for retrofitting are proposed. The payback period obtained from the solutions is an average of 3.75-year periods for Malaga, 3.52-year periods for Cordoba, 3.42-year periods for Valencia, and 2-year periods for Madrid. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG. 2023.

AB  - Rising ambient temperatures due to climate change will impact both indoor temperatures and heating and cooling utility costs. In traditionally colder climates, there are potential tradeoffs in how to meet the reduced heating and increased cooling demands, and issues related to lack of air conditioning (AC) access in older homes and among lower-income populations to prevent extreme heat exposure. We modeled a typical multi-family home in Boston (MA) in the building simulation program EnergyPlus to assess indoor temperature and energy consumption in current (2020) and projected future (2050) weather conditions. Selected households were those without AC (no AC), those who ran AC sometimes (some AC), and those with sufficient resources to run AC always (full AC). We considered stylized cooling subsidy policies that allowed households to move between groups, both independently and in conjunction with energy efficiency retrofits. Results showed that future weather conditions without policy changes yielded an increase in indoor summer temperatures of 2.1 °C (no AC), increased cooling demand (range: 34–50%), but led to a decrease in net yearly total utility costs per apartment (range: − $21 to − $38). Policies that allowed households to move to greater AC utilization yielded average indoor summer temperature decreases (− 3.5 °C to − 6.2 °C) and net yearly total utility increases (range: + $2 to + $94) per apartment unit, with greater savings for retrofitted homes primarily due to large decreases in heating use. Our model results reinforce the importance of coordinated public policies addressing climate change that have an equity lens for both health and climate goals. © 2023, The New York Academy of Medicine.

AB  - Individuals living in areas exposed to meteorological phenomena, lacking infrastructure and essential services, will be mostly affected by the risks of climate change. The adoption of mitigation measures is urgent in the search to reduce the impact on future generations, and the housing sector is an affordable way to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This would have an impact on the real estate market, so construction, urban planning and real estate valuation professionals should pay attention to the research on mitigation actions currently established in the energy transition process. This paper compares the energy use between the social housing with energy efficiency for a warm-dry climate and the predominant housing in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora; in order to know the difference in their GHG emissions. The process consisted of 1) Defining a methodology to determine a baseline; 2) Determine a baseline for energy efficiency in the analyzed climate; 3) Select the predominant housing prototype in the study site; 4) Estimate the use of energy and the emissions released in both scenarios. Revealing that the predominant social housing releases a volume of emissions of about 40% higher than the housing that meets the energy efficiency parameters established in the actual codes and Mexican standards, therefore, could be a feasible way to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions. © 2023, Contexto.

AB  - The growing interest in sustainability, efficiency and digitalization in the residential construction sector motivates research into the use of maritime cargo containers to build modular, sustainable, and efficient housing in Spain. Based on the demand for configurable and flexible housing, legal, design, industrial and technological criteria are studied to develop a trio of housing models of one, two and three bedrooms, complying with the applicable regulations and standards, using maritime cargo containers as the basis. The design proposals are adapted to the requirements of the Technical Building Code and the UNE-EN 1647 standard on habitable recreational vehicles and mobile residences, allowing them to be considered both real estate and mobile assets. The reuse of maritime cargo containers, modular, industrialized, and prefabricated construction, together with the use of recycled and recyclable materials, promote sustainability and the circular economy. In addition, the implementation of digital technologies and the adoption of sustainable design principles and energy efficiency reduce environmental impact and improve livability, safety, and functionality to its inhabitants. In summary, this proposal demonstrates the feasibility of using maritime cargo containers in the construction of modular, scalable, sustainable, and efficient housing, contributing to a better future. © 2023 by The authors.

AB  - In the structure of commercial real estate, hotel infrastructure facilities occupy a special position due to their dependence on related industries: tourism, both international and domestic, entertainment industry, event organization, business environment development, etc. Also, this industry is most affected by external factors: legal, political, economic, infrastructural, communication, cultural. Trends in the introduction of energy-efficient technologies in the processes of operation and maintenance of real estate objects of the hospitality industry allow to increase their competitiveness and increase the number of transactions. The leaders in the number of investment transactions in the hotel real estate segment for 2022 are traditionally Moscow and St. Petersburg, but the development of domestic tourism gives impetus to increased investment activity in other regions of the Russian Federation. The purpose of the study is to identify the impact of the energy efficiency level on the competitiveness of hotel real estate. Research objectives: analysis of trends in the hotel real estate market, determination of indicators of competitiveness of hotel facilities depending on the type of accommodation, consumer requests and the level of energy efficiency, calculation of the integral indicator of competitiveness of hotel real estate. Research methods: comparison, analysis and synthesis, generalization, expert evaluation method. As a result of the study, the key factors of the competitiveness of hotel facilities are identified and the methodology for calculating the integral indicator of competitiveness is given. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - Growing concerns over environmental issues and sustainable living have resulted in increased interest in renewable energy and energy efficiency. The real estate market is no exception, with homeowners increasingly considering the market value of green and sustainable buildings, which can offer both energy efficiency and potential health benefits. This study investigates the level of interest among homeowners in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures for their homes and how it relates to their perception of the market value of green or sustainable buildings in the real estate market. A survey was conducted in the Paphos urban complex in Cyprus, with 180 participants over the age of 18. The participants were selected through a random sampling method and were representative of the general population in terms of gender, age, and income. Data were collected on their attitudes towards renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, as well as their perceptions of the market value of green buildings. The data collected were analyzed using various statistical methods, including Cronbach’s α coefficient, the non-parametric Friedman test, descriptive statistics, and factor analysis, with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) being used for coding and analysis. Results indicate that 64% of the homeowners surveyed were interested in investing in renewable energy sources, and 72% were interested in energy efficiency measures. Additionally, findings suggest a moderate level of interest (58%) among homeowners in investing in renewable energy sources and that this is positively associated with their perception of the market value of green buildings. Furthermore, homeowners with higher income and education levels tend to be more interested in investing in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures and perceive green buildings as having higher market value. This study provides insights into the factors that drive homeowners’ investment in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, shedding light on the relationship between homeowners’ perceptions of the market value of green buildings and their interest in such investments. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This paper discusses the design of a net-zero single-family house in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which was proposed for the 2022 Solar Decathlon Design Challenge entry. The site was in a 100-year flood zone and registered as a national and local historic district. The interdisciplinary team consisted of University of Tennessee Chattanooga (UTC) students from the interior architecture and engineering departments who embraced the challenges of the local climate and the restrictions of the historic district guidelines. This entry, Moc House, focused on the integration of passive design and active HVAC systems including photovoltaic systems in the process. In responding to recent housing market changes in Chattanooga due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a young professional couple in their 30s who have two children was identified as the target market which guided the space planning. Market analysis, including ROI, was conducted in addition to construction cost calculations. Building materials were selected to enhance the durability and resilience of the house structure. Finally, energy analysis was conducted to check the project’s Home Energy Rating using Ekotrope and found it less than zero. © 2023, College Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - While house price indices aim to measure the change in price of an identical dwelling over time, many are unable to sufficiently control for changes in the quality of the houses sold. This change in quality is a known, but rarely measured, factor. Our paper proposes a new framework to disentangle and quantify the contribution of each individual dwelling characteristic to the quality change. It can be applied to many frequently used hedonic house price indices and allows for non-linear, time-varying price premia for the various dwelling characteristics. Using data from Belgium for 2011 Q3 - 2021 Q2, we found that the quality of the houses sold increased substantially, mostly due to improvements in energy efficiency. As energy performance will continue to improve to meet European climate goals, statistical agencies should incorporate it into the construction of their house price indices in order to avoid overestimating price growth. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Social houses are built around the world to fulfill the basic needs of the growing population, especially middle-income families. Owing to the low budget available for such houses around the globe, necessary energy codes are often compromised. This research, through a methodological sustainability framework, presents the case study of Mexico with the objective to address this worldwide issue. More than 100,000 social houses were built in Mexico just in the year 2021 without strictly following any definitive building energy codes. Eventually, this is a ticking bomb, if left unaddressed, that can bring serious energy and environmental consequences connected with various social issues. Thus, as a research gap, the conventional 4E (energy, exergy, economic, and environmental) analysis cannot fully address such a complex energy-environmental-economic-social nexus. This work proposes an integrated sustainability framework of the practicability of the bioclimatic architecture of such a social house including energy, economic, environmental, and social assessment (novel addition to the analysis). The novel methodology is implemented on a novel technological advancement where double-façade architecture (i.e., solar chimney) is installed through a synergy and intelligent operation with an active air conditioning system including a desiccant enhanced air cooler and novel dew-point evaporative cooler. The article makes use of conventional physics-based modeling of thermal machines combined with an artificial neural network digital twin-based data-driven non-sorting genetic optimization of solar chimneys for various climatic conditions of Mexico. The optimal points are evaluated using annual climatic data to maintain the thermal comfort conditions and the results have suggested an increase of ∼48% through intelligent integration of double-façade architecture with the Maisotsenko cycle air cooler. Life-cycle economic assessment has suggested the Levelized cost of air conditioning be between 0.0096 and 0.0390 USD/kWh and can save up to ∼273 MXN per month with a real payback period of ∼8 years. Environment assessment has reported mitigation of up to ∼5668.59 kgCO2/year as compared to conventional vapor compression refrigeration systems. The social assessment is conducted on a pilot scale to directly ask the people of Mexico about their perception of the installation of the solar chimney while giving the fact that the initial price of the social houses can increase between 2.5 and 4%. It is reported that ∼62% of the sample is willing to install it even with a high price tag with a motive to initiate the climate change mitigation phenomena. The importance of the work has concluded that the government needs to take drastic and tough decisions to further regulate the energy efficiency in the social houses and limit the constructors to offer sustainable building construction. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Colocation data centers play a pivotal role in the digital era, serving as the backbone for a diverse range of businesses, from startups to large enterprises. The global data center construction market, which reached an approximate value of US 218.88 billion in 2021, is experiencing unprecedented growth. This surge can be attributed to the ever-increasing volume of data, propelled by economic advancements and population expansion. Consequently, long-term private equity firms and real estate investment trusts (REITs) are increasingly drawn to data center investments for their attributes of transparency and accountability. However, data centers face challenges in terms of project lead times and budget constraints, particularly during expansion phases. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative power forecasting system that takes into account both internal and external demand signals, leading to more accurate and realistic predictions. These predictions serve as valuable guides for resource allocation and utilization. The system lever- ages a combination of data generation, deep learning (DL), and time-series analysis methods, and later, we use it in our future work to proactively address issues such as supply shortages, ensure the maintenance of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and optimize resource usage. We synthesized a comprehensive dataset tailored to the data center environment using the small dataset provided by S&P Global. This dataset was enriched with macroeconomic data to capture external influences accurately. Subsequently, we conducted a rigorous evaluation, testing various machine learning models, including linear models, transformer-based models, and a multivariate LSTM model. Our experiments revealed that the PatchTST model outperformed the others, providing the most reliable and precise results. The implementation of advanced analytics further enhances energy efficiency, optimizes equipment utilization, and maximizes the effective utilization of floor space within data centers. Furthermore, efficient resource allocation, guided by the power forecasting system, ensures that customer demands are met promptly and effectively.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Addressing the total energy cost burden of elderly people is essential for designing equitable and effective energy policies, especially in responding to energy crisis in an aging society. It is due to the double impact of energy price hikes on households-through direct impact on fuel bills and indirect impact on the prices of goods and services consumed. However, while examining the household energy cost burden of the elderly, their indirect energy consumption and associated cost burden remain poorly understood. This study quantifies and compares the direct and indirect energy footprints and associated total energy cost burdens for different age groups across 31 developed countries. It reveals that the elderly have larger per capita energy footprints, resulting from higher levels of both direct and indirect energy consumption compared with the younger age groups. More importantly, the elderly, especially the low-income elderly, have a higher total energy cost burden rate. As the share of elderly in the total population rapidly grows in these countries, the larger per capita energy footprint and associated cost burden rate of elderly people would make these aging countries more vulnerable in times of energy crises. It is therefore crucial to develop policies that aim to reduce energy consumption and costs, improve energy efficiency, and support low-income elderly populations. Such policies are necessary to reduce the vulnerability of these aging countries to the energy crisis.

AB  - In this paper, a system for energy production from biomass combustion to provide electricity to the national grid of Vietnam was evaluated based on different thermodynamics systems and the cultivation capacity of the local area. A 20:80 mixture of cashew shell and cashew wood chip is considered as fuel source to be combusted utilizing a fixed bed technology with high energy efficiency. Considering a 10 MW production capacity to the national grid, a 20-year Net Present Value analysis and payback time evaluation was considered based on the economic factors in Vietnam. The study demonstrates how the current feed-in tariff in Vietnam is too low to encourage investment in biomass power plant. Following a suggested electricity selling price that is close to the household electric cost, the power plant shows high potential with a short payback period of 9.22 years and a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of only 6.4 cents/kWh. Sensitivity analyses were performed for different scenarios of material cost, electricity selling price and initial investment to show that within a 10 % variation in process factors, such project would still be able to reach payback within 20 years, with an overall LCOE of around 5–7 cents/kWh, proving the high potential of biomass-based energy production projects. © 2024 International Energy Initiative

AB  - Purpose: To significantly adopt and improve indoor energy efficiency in building infrastructure in developing countries can be a challenging venture. Thus, this study aimed to assess the satisfaction of indoor environmental quality and its effect on energy use intensity and efficient among student housing. Design/methodology/approach: The study is quantitative and hinged on the contrast theory. A survey of 1,078 student residents living in purpose-built student housing was contacted. Using Post-Occupancy Evaluation and Multiple Linear Regression, critical variables such as thermal comfort, visual comfort and indoor air quality and 21 indicators were assessed. Data on annual energy consumption and total square metre of the indoor area were utilised to assess energy use intensity. Findings: The study found a direct relationship between satisfaction with indoor environmental quality and energy use intensity. The study showed that students were more satisfied with thermal comfort conditions than visual and indoor air quality. Overall, these indicators contributed to 75.9% kWh/m2 minimum and 43.2% kWh/m2 maximum energy use intensity in student housing in Ghana. High occupancy and small useable space in student housing resulted in high energy use intensity. Practical implications: Inclusions of sustainable designs and installation of smart mechanical systems are feedback to student housing designers. Again, adaptation to retrofitting ideas can facilitate energy efficiency in the current state of student housing in Ghana. Originality/value: Earlier studies have argued for and against the satisfaction of indoor environmental quality in student housing. However, these studies have neglected to examine the impact on energy use intensity. This is novel because the assessment of energy use intensity in this study has a positive influence on active design incorporation among student housing. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Individual housing construction in the Krasnoyarsk Territory is actively developing. Rising housing prices in multi-storey buildings, increasing building density, and socio-demographic factors are increasing the popularity of individual construction. Technologies for such construction imply the widespread use of available local building materials, in particular wood. During the study, the designs of private houses in the settlement - the regional center of the Krasnoyarsk Territory - were analyzed. It was found that 90% of the sample examined were houses built from timber. Using simulation modeling methods, the actual thermal resistance of the enclosing structure made of timber with a cross-section of 0.15×0.15 m was determined. The calculated value was compared with the standard resistance indicator of the enclosing structure, taking into account energy saving standards. The Elcut solid modeling system was used in the work. The required heat flow power to maintain stationary heat transfer conditions was determined. It has been established that the design enclosing structure does not provide the required thermal resistance taking into account energy saving standards. It is necessary to consider a multilayer enclosing structure and increase the design resistance by insulating the outer surface of the wall with heat-insulating materials. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - The objective of this research is to explore the potential of financial inclusion and low-carbon architectural design strategies as solutions to improve the thermal comfort and energy efficiency of new buildings in different architectural climate conditions. The manufacture sector, which accounts for about 40% of all yearly greenhouse gas releases, has been stimulating with trying to reduce the amount of energy it consumes and the detrimental effects it has on the climate, in accordance with the standards outlined in the 2016 Paris Agreement. In this study, panel data analysis is used to examine the connection between green property financing and carbon dioxide emissions from the building sector in one hundred and five developed and developing countries. Although this analysis finds a negative correlation among the development of environmentally friendly real estate financing and firms' worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, it finds that this correlation is most robust in developing nations. A number of these countries are experiencing an unregulated and rapid population explosion, which has boosted their demand for oil, making this discovery essential for them. The difficulty in securing green funding during this crisis is slowing and even reversing gains made in past years, making it all the more important to keep this momentum going during the COVID-19 outbreak. It's critical to keep the momentum going by doing something. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Solar-powered membrane distillation is a promising desalination technology that can provide accessible and reliable freshwater for coastal and island households. However, high installment cost and low efficiency are two main hindering factors restricting the widespread application of this technology. To solve these issues, a low-cost air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) desalination system powered by efficient evacuated U-tube solar collector (EUSC) is put forward to theoretically predict its effectiveness. A system-scale mathematical model for the proposed hybrid system is established and validated. The system performance is predicted under the weather conditions of southeast China (Ningbo city). The maximum permeate flux, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency are, respectively, 3.16kgm−2h−1, 56.71% and 0.38%, showing a bright application prospect. Numerous parametric studies are undertaken to explore how to further enhance the performance of this technique. The long-term running performance for the year of 2021 and last 41 years is also revealed. The yearly average production is about 6452 kg, which can satisfy the drinking water demand for a household of 6 members. Furthermore, economic study is presented and the levelized cost of water is only 8.54$/m3. The proposed EUSC/AGMD coupling system is an efficient and economic alternative for small-scale solar seawater desalination. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The financing of energy efficiency measures and renovations is key to reaching energy efficiency targets for the housing sector. The purpose of this article is to add the Swedish case of how capital market funds have become accessible and used by public and private housing companies, in particular for energy efficiency measures. The core of this article are interviews with representatives of Swedish housing companies made during the spring of 2021 with the purpose of mapping how public and larger private housing companies finance renovation and energy efficiency measures, and to what extent funds from the capital market are used for these purposes. In this article, we have found that capital market funds are commonly used by the Swedish public and the largest private housing companies. Bonds are less costly compared to bank loans, and green bonds are 0.02–0.03 percentage points less costly than conventional bonds. Furthermore, control systems that investigate the values of building portfolios as security for bonds are poor. A conclusion is that governmental control systems over the capital market issuing bonds for the housing market could be needed to avert future housing bubbles. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - We revisit the issue of the energy efficiency (EE) gap by explicitly acknowledg-ing the two-sided nature of the rental housing market and two-sided asymmetries of information between tenants and landlords. Employing a theoretical matching model, we show that Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) that signal a dwell-ing’s energy performance induce optimal EE investments by landlords only if tenants pay their energy expenditures in full. When landlords pay part of the energy expenditures, they seek tenants who will conserve energy. Our model shows that asymmetry of information over tenant characteristics results in suboptimally low investments in EE. This may even render EPCs counterproductive. As a remedy, we show that tenant-side signaling needs to be rolled out jointly with EPCs and may even be sufficient when contracts include energy expenditures. Data from an original survey provides support for these insights and suggests that information on the tenants’ side contributes to more EE investment. © 2023 by the IAEE. All rights reserved.

AB  - Germany's climate goals require over 75% of its housing stock to be retrofitted for energy efficiency. An important question for Germany and other countries is, what minimum energy efficiency standard should be mandated for housing retrofits so as to reduce CO2 emissions economically efficiently? It has long been known that the marginal costs of energy efficiency increase as standards are pushed higher, and therefore the marginal costs of CO2 abatement increase, but at the same time energy consumption reduces, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. This paper investigates where the social optimum lies between these two effects. In addition to a large database of house sale advertisements containing price and energy efficiency data, it uses two semi-official data sources of modelled and actual energy efficiency upgrades in Germany. It finds that retrofitting to a modestly high standard of about 70 kWh/m2/y entails marginal costs of CO2 abatement comparable to current CO2 prices. However, each step to a higher standard increases these by up to an order of magnitude, with absurdly high marginal costs of CO2 abatement for the highest standards. German policymakers are currently pushing for higher minimum standards, but money could better be spent retrofitting more houses to less stringent standards. © 2023 The Author

AB  - Purpose: The current literature has not investigated the perceived value of energy efficiency by households, regardless of financial benefits. Furthermore, there is a severe lack of research that investigates the effectiveness of the current format of EPC-labels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: to study how households value energy efficiency in the housing market, regardless of price effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses multiple hedonic regression models to analyse 706,778 Flemish properties for sale or rent between 2019 and 2023. The data is provided by Immoweb – the largest online real estate platform in Belgium. Given that the selling market is driven by different mechanisms than the rental market, the data set was divided in sold (522,164 listings) and rented properties (184,614 listings). Findings: The ambiguous results of the A-label in the selling market indicate that the “class evaluation effect” found in related markets which use labels (e.g. household appliances) is also present in the housing market. However, the results of the other (lower) labels clearly show that owners do value energy improvements within labels, and this effect becomes stronger as the EPC-label becomes better. The rental market shows the opposite results. Energy improvements are only valued if they translate into a financial benefit. Taking these findings into account, the second part of this research shows that rescaling the EPC-label creates an incentive for improvements within labels. Originality/value: This paper provides novel insights by studying the perceived value of energy efficiency in the absence of financial benefits and critically studying the effectiveness of the EPC-labels in their current shape. By investigating both the sales and rental market, the authors are able to make a comparison which creates valuable insights for academia, governments and real estate professionals. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The built environment accounts for approximately 38% of global emissions. The evaluation of returns linked to investments in building decarbonization is impeded when confronted with uncertainties surrounding future energy prices, building emission regulations, and real estate market conditions. This paper develops an integrated framework that combines energy modeling with investment analysis to support the adoption of decarbonizing technologies under a context of uncertainty. The integrated framework includes projections of costs and benefits associated with the adoption of technology (i.e., changes in rental cashflows, vacancy rates, maintenance and energy costs) under a wide range of potential pathways of the energy markets and regulatory environment, and local real estate market demand for green buildings using Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, this paper develops the approach to investigate the potential value of flexibility in designing for building electrification (i.e., the ability to fully electrify gas heating systems at a later year). We illustrate the use of this approach in a case study of a new office building in New York City, faced with design choices between natural gas and electrified heating systems. We consider 10,000 scenarios changing future greenhouse emission penalties, investments in the local electric grid, local real estate market conditions and energy prices. In approximately 60 percent of simulations, the most profitable decision for the building owner is to adopt a natural gas-powered heating system. However, adopting a building design that provides a building the flexibility to fully electrify at a later date is more profitable than a natural gas-heating building in 96 percent of scenarios. A sensitivity analysis shows that the most influential parameter in the valuation of a design option is the size of the green premiums associated with improved energy efficiency. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainable urban development has come to play an essential role in establishing and growing future sustainable cities, or smart cities, which are urban areas that have an optimum carbon footprint, are nature-friendly, and are smart enough to enhance energy efficiency. This study is based on qualitative research in which data were collected from interviews with real estate development specialists. The interviews were addressed to a total of 30 real estate developers from Romania between July and December 2022 and were conducted using the Zoom interface. The aim of this research was to analyze whether familiarity with the smart green concept influences the decision to implement the IoT on a large scale at the organizational level through the perception of specific determining factors in choosing the development of green building projects considering the operational costs. The results revealed a significant indirect effect of green building knowledge on large-scale IoT implementation through the mediator of the perception of operating cost factors, supporting our hypothesis. The direct effect in the presence of the mediator was not found to be significant anymore. Hence, there is full complementary mediation by the perception of operating cost factors on the relationship between green building knowledge and large-scale IoT implementation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Regarding environmental sustainability and market pricing, the energy class is an increasingly more decisive characteristic in the real estate sector. For this reason, a great deal of attention is now devoted to exploring new technologies, energy consumption forecasting tools, intelligent platforms, site management devices, optimised procedures, software, and guidelines. New investments and smart possibilities are currently the object of different research in energy efficiency in building stocks to reach widespread ZEB standards as soon as possible. In this light, this work focuses on analysing 13 cities in Northern Italy to understand the impact of energy class on market values. An extensive data-mining process collects information about 13,093 properties in Lombardia, Piemonte, Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia-Giulia, Veneto, and Trentino alto Adige. Then, a feature importance analysis and a machine learning forecasting tool help understand the influence of energy class on market prices today. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The rising energy consumption in residential buildings within the hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) climate zone, driven by occupants’ pursuit of improved thermal comfort, necessitates effective energy conservation measures. This study established urban building energy models for 32,145 residential buildings in Changsha City, China, and conducted a comprehensive retrofit analysis of seven energy conservation measures (ECMs). Additionally, the study assessed the impact of residents’ conscious energy-saving behaviors concerning air conditioner (AC) control. The research commenced by creating six baseline models representative of the diverse building stock. Identifying seven commonly used ECMs, the study examined the potential of each measure for enhancing energy efficiency. To facilitate the analysis, a dedicated toolkit, AutoBPS-Retrofit, was developed to efficiently modify the baseline model for each ECM. Furthermore, the investigation delved into the investment cost of implementing the ECMs and evaluated their simple payback year (PBP) and net present value (NPV). The results demonstrate that tailored retrofit plans are essential when addressing envelope improvements, varying according to building types and ages. Retrofits targeting lighting systems offer both promising energy savings and favorable economic viability, albeit subject to residents’ preferences. Alternatively, upgrading the AC systems emerges as the most energy-efficient approach, yet the economic assessment raises concerns. The study’s findings offer practical insights for governments seeking to establish effective carbon reduction goals and policies. Moreover, the research can assist energy-saving institutions, real-estate companies, and stakeholders involved in renovation projects by offering guidance in making informed decisions to enhance energy efficiency in city-scale residential buildings. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Our study aims to analyse whether the capitalisation of a property’s energy performance is affected by how it is presented. In place since 2002, there is an EU directive mandating the introduction of an energy performance certificate (EPC) when selling detached houses. This directive was implemented in Sweden in 2009. We analyse how EPC capitalised on housing prices during 2012–2018 for detached houses in Stockholm. This was previously carried out, but our contribution is to analyse both the effect of energy rating or labelling (A–G) and energy consumption (kWh/m²). How energy performance is communicated or displayed to potential buyers conveys that the format, style, and content of energy performance information may influence how buyers perceive its value and impact on the property’s market price. We have information on energy rating, consumption, or both for selected properties. This allows us to test the hypothesis that how energy performance is presented affects pricing. We also tested whether information affects different age cohorts differently. The results indicate that how energy performance is presented and visualised is important and that information about rating and consumption might be considered as a substitute for each other. It is also clear that the capitalisation effect differs depending on the age of the building. © 2023 by the author.

AB  - The aim of this research study is to illustrate the role of the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) and Leadership in Energy and Design (LEED) within low-cost urban housing projects through the analysis of multiple factors and motivations impacting the outcome of construction projects. The rate at which climate change is advancing demands that the construction industry change their practices to decrease the natural resources it consumes as well as improve the environmental efficiency of the world's building stock. The introduction of BREEAM and LEED in 1990 and 2000, respectively, provided a system where buildings are evaluated on their energy performance. Issues, however, began to develop as research that illustrated the system's drawbacks undermined its utility. In turn, the role of the green building certifications ought to be researched so that policy and stakeholder communication frameworks can be developed by contractors and designers to ensure the success of BREEAM and LEED projects. The research study was completed through a literature study of prior research as well as by the publishing of a snowball sampling-based survey questionnaire undertaken between practitioners, architects, engineers as well as researchers involved in the UK construction industry. The results of the survey were then collated using IBM's Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) and then a confirmatory factor analysis as well as a correlation matrix was completed. The confirmatory factor analysis illustrated that the two most important factors were climate change and quality. Thus, contractors and designers ought to develop practical policies and stakeholder frameworks to achieve value for money for the market demographic. The results of this study hold potential to increase the application of BREEAM and LEED. The improvement of practice in low-cost urban housing projects will improve the accessibility of BREEAM and LEED housing projects and, in turn, the energy efficiency and sustainability of new building stock. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Energy efficiency and renewable energy are key pillars of the energy transition that is high on the political agenda of governments in face of the climate crisis. Germany, however, is underperforming in its emissions reduction goals. There is still room for improvement, especially in the building sector – but this is often associated with high upfront investments. There is evidence that the market for energy efficiency in the German rental housing market is inefficient, resulting in underinvestment. To investigate these inefficiencies, this study estimates a hedonic pricing model combined with a total-cost-of-use perspective based on the observation of warm rents for a sample of 3,903,473 rental offers from 2014 to 2021. In a “perfect world”, the effect of the energy performance score given in energy performance certificates as an indicator of energy consumption or demand, respectively, is expected to be zero, as corresponding costs are already included in the warm rent. If the coefficient is significantly different from zero, it can be interpreted as measure for inefficiencies. The study further investigates whether disclosing heating costs in real estate advertisements could lead to a better appreciation of energy efficiency in the rental market and thus contribute to closing the information gap. Results show that the market for energy efficiency is indeed inefficient; however, the disclosure of full information can help to overcome these inefficiencies. These results lead to several important policy implications. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This chapter presents the basic principles of a successful application of the BIM method from the perspective of facility management (FM). Starting from the development stages to the current understanding of BIM, the basics of CAFM systems are also introduced, as well as their scope of functions and typical challenges of CAFM projects in relation to the BIM method. In order to answer the central question of the benefits of BIM for FM, important BIM application cases are considered along the individual operational phases, from commissioning, operation to renovation and end of life. This includes the consideration of economic, technical and above all organizational aspects. With the explanation of the principle of digital twins, the concepts of BIM, CAFM and IoT are linked to each other in order to use BIM models not only for the static description of buildings, but also in the context of dynamic building use for predictions of building behaviour and for the optimization of energy efficiency. The implementation of the BIM method in FM and the understanding of BIM for facility managers in the planning and construction phase, is dealt with in the following section. For this purpose, basic definitions of the BIM method are presented, as well as different stages for the introduction of BIM using the BIM maturity model, and typical additional dimensions of BIM for the consideration of time, cost and operational view are presented. In order to implement this practically, however, important basics of model-based data exchange must be taken into account. The different forms of using (open) or manufacturer-specific (closed) data formats for cooperation with BIM are explained and practical tips for the definition of asset information requirements (AIR) as a specification of requirements for BIM from the FM perspective are presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Cloud computing is a fast emerging utility- oriented paradigm providing services to a large number of users across World Wide Web based on spend-as-per-yourutilization model. To offer its users computational services, data centers eat up a lot of energy. Such excessive consumption of power by those virtualized data centers has increased the operating cost of cloud environment for both cloud service provider as well as for intended user. Normally, a typical data center wipes out energy which generally equals to energy consumption of 25000 houses. Along with increasing cost, it also degrades the environment badly by emitting large amount of carbon dioxide gas and thus becoming one of the major causes for environmental issues like global warming and green house effects. In this research paper, the proposed technique not only trying to meet energy efficiency requirement but will also prevent the breaching of Service Level Agreement (SLA) and thus provide cloud users with Quality of Service (QOS). © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Climate policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions can lead to decreases in the values of assets, risking them to become “stranded”. We study the price effects of the introduction of a specific climate policy, a minimum energy efficiency standard, in the housing market. Leveraging a unique data set of the population of all residential house transactions in England and Wales, we show that prices of energy-inefficient properties affected by this policy decreased on average by about £5k to £9k relative to efficient ones. We interpret this evidence as being consistent with semi-strong market efficiency in the housing market. © 2023

AB  - In this study, a supply chain is considered including the government, a monopolistic supplier, two manufacturers, two agencies, and customers. The manufacturers produce two substitutable electricity home appliances, i.e., energy-efficient and inefficient products, and sell them to customers via their agencies. The supplier provides industrial and household energies for the manufacturers and customers, respectively. The government sets the tax rates to the members and customers. Furthermore, it promotes the energy-efficient product by lowering the tax rates levied on its manufacturer and agency. In return, the customers' demands for both products are determined based on the selling prices to customers, the household energy consumption costs, and the efficiency rate of the energy-efficient product. Then, the game-theoretic frameworks are applied to make decisions under various competitive scenarios and different power structures. Finally, decisions are discussed and several insights are revealed. It is concluded that Nash game leads to higher utilities achieved by the government and customers. The government and customers' utilities increase by supporting the energy-efficient product. The members and government benefit from increasing the efficiency rate of the energy-efficient product. Moreover, from the whole system's perspective, it is preferable to reduce the tax rate imposed by the government on the members. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the regulatory barriers to achieving sustainable buildings in Kosovo. The present paper focuses on regulatory barriers viewed from the perspective of construction industry experts in achieving sustainable buildings. Design/methodology/approach: The present study uses a qualitative research method and semi-structured interviews as a research instrument. The present study interviews around 20 experts in construction and property management, property development, spatial planning and energy management. Findings: The study finds that Kosovo building laws and regulations provide for the materials assessment criteria, but the materials assessment criteria are only for mechanic strength. The study further finds that the sustainability concept is not included and incorporated in Kosovo's urban planning laws and regulations. The study also finds that despite specific clauses mentioning energy performance certificates in the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings in Kosovo, energy performance certificates appears to be not enforced and the nature of the barrier is more organizational rather than regulatory. Finally, the study finds that Kosovo laws are silent as far as green labeling of building materials is concerned. Practical implications: The implication of the present finding is that policymakers in Kosovo not only should include clear sustainable materials assessment criteria in the law, but also enforce those criteria through testing and inspection mechanisms included in the law and implemented in practice through funding and organizational support. Nonetheless, policymakers in Kosovo should contemplate amending the urban planning laws in Kosovo and include both the term of sustainability at the planning level and conformity guidelines for sustainable design that can be done at the administrative directive level. Further, the clauses in the law do not suffice if the clauses are not accompanied by specific systemic and organizational support in the issuance of energy performance certificates. Policymakers in Kosovo should be proactive in designing clauses that specify green labeling standards for materials; however, these labeling standards should not adversely affect the cost of construction and reduce the demand for real estate. Originality/value: The study is the first qualitative study about the perception of construction professionals in Kosovo, regarding the regulatory barriers of sustainable buildings in Kosovo. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The mismatch between the technical condition, functional and operational characteristics of apartment buildings, on the one hand, current standards and requirements imposed by the population, on the other hand, promote the need for energy-efficient capital repairs of common property. Modernization of engineering systems and installation of automatic devices, regulating the supply of thermal energy into a building, allow to significantly reduce the consumption of utilities. Indeed, apartment owners source and pay for the necessary scope of services without overpaying for "excessive" heating, while the controllability of indoor temperatures enhances comfort. Moreover, market prices for the housing, that features higher energy efficiency characteristics, are increasingly high. Therefore, there is a vital need to arrange the process of energy efficient capital repairs. The purpose of the research. The purpose of the research is to elaborate actions on the energy efficient capital repairs of apartment buildings and obtain financial support from the State Corporation "The Support Fund for the Reform of the Housing and Utilities Sector." The comprehensive analysis of regulatory legal acts adopted at the level of the Russian Federation and the Moscow Region; the economic analysis of costs of energy efficiency actions and utility payments that may be potentially saved by the co-owners of the common property of apartment buildings; the software package "Assistant in energy efficient capital repairs." The results represent a package of actions on the implementation of projects on energy efficient capital repairs of common property in apartment buildings using the software package "Assistant in energy efficient capital repairs" for the purpose of obtaining financial support from the State Corporation "The Support Fund for the Reform of the Housing and Utilities Sector". © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess urban policies from the point of view of their impact on energy efficiency as a factor enhancing local competitiveness in Poland. To achieve this objective, we carried out an original study. The first step was to conduct a literature review. Next, an attempt was made to present the prevailing state of knowledge regarding the management of the competitiveness of cities and regions, as well as the functioning of energy efficiency in the economy. The development strategies of 18 selected cities serving as provincial capitals or playing other administrative roles at the regional level were also analysed. Importantly, the impact envisaged for municipal authorities to improve energy efficiency largely focuses on investments in the modernisation of public transport infrastructure and renewable energy sources. These investments certainly yield substantial cost savings, which are presented in the article. Nevertheless, it is essential to bear in mind that these are not the sole advantages of increased energy efficiency of local socio-economic systems. The investments also have the potential to enhance the perception of cities, increase the value of municipal real estate, and improve the health of urban residents by reducing emissions into the atmosphere. Still, a clearly discernible link between these arguments and a positive impact of cities’ energy savings on their competitive standing and competitive edge is absent from the analysed city development strategies. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid growth of the world demands a shift towards more energy-efficient practices, particularly in the construction industry, which still largely relies on unsustainable methods. This study aims to identify and analyze the barriers hindering the adoption of energy-efficient design practices from the perspective of United States developers. Through an extensive literature review, barriers were categorized into financial, informational, and administrative themes, with nine sub-categories. In this research 115 papers were evaluated and among them 49 papers were selected to find the barriers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with local real estate developers to validate and further explore the identified barriers. For the interview 5 developers were invited to gain their insights in energy-efficient design and construction adoption. Financial barriers pose challenges in accurately valuing above-baseline energy efficiency, leading to uncertainties and financial risks for developers in a rapidly changing resale market. Informational gaps among key stakeholders hinder informed decision-making, with limited time and asymmetric information hindering the adoption of energy-efficient measures. Administrative barriers, shaped by government policies, play a dual role in promoting and hindering energy efficiency. The most critical theme reported by developers was informational barriers, particularly emphasizing the importance of owner education as a key leverage point. To address these barriers effectively, the study recommends a concentrated effort on public education and government incentives, alongside the establishment of stringent energy efficiency standards in building codes. Future research should also involve other stakeholders within the industry to gain a more comprehensive understanding of energy efficiency adoption and explore effective strategies for promoting sustainable practices in real estate development. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Indonesian government by 2030 has placed a high priority on enhancing the quality and utilization of renewable energy to tackle energy and environmental challenges, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 9.4. To assess future trends in energy demand, consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Indonesia from 2020 to 2060, various scenarios and sub-scenarios are analyzed. This study focuses on achieving NZE for consistency by 2060 through technology adoption and CO2 emission reductions, in line with the Paris Agreement's objective of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The research emphasizes the significance of enhancing energy efficiency through demand-side management and energy-efficient technologies. These measures not only result in cost savings for households, businesses, industries, and the government but also contribute to carbon emission reductions. GHG emission projections utilize the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) application. The Sulawesi region is expected to witness substantial growth in energy demand, particularly within the industrial sector. Key industries such as food and beverage production, tobacco, textiles and garments, leather and footwear, bamboo and rattan, paper, paper products, etc., are projected to experience significant increases in electricity demand. The growth rates for these sectors range from 5.09% to 37.1%, indicating a rising need for electricity to support various industrial processes. Notably, the total emissions in Sulawesi decreased impressively by 22.17% between 2021 and 2060. Similarly, the Maluku region demonstrates a promising trend of increasing electricity demand in the industrial sector, with an overall growth rate projected to be 5.93%. The food and beverage industry are expected to witness significant growth at a rate of 8.01%, while the textile and apparel sector and the pulp and paper sector are estimated to grow at rates of 9.02% and 9.22%, respectively. The total emissions in Maluku reduced significantly by 20.54%.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In this article, multitrial vector-based differential evolution algorithm (MTDE) is proposed as energy and cost management controller under Time of Use (TOU) tariff in grid associated domestic PV-wind power system tied with battery storages. To enrich the energy efficiency of a proposed power system, two optimisation algorithms are proposed in the scheduling operation. TOU billing is a cost-reflective power pricing strategy that has been found as an effective way to reduce peak energy consumption in the residential segment everywhere the world, mainly in industrialised nations. In the optimisation maximizing the cost benefit of the household energy is taken as the objective and the dispatching ratio of electricity sold to the grid and used locally is treated as the optimisation variable. Using MATLAB, the performance of proposed MTDE in the aspect of daily cost benefit and revenue growth rate are presented with the comparative analysis of gravitational search algorithm and conventional self-made for self-consumed and rest for sale (SFC&RFS) mode-based energy management controller. In comparison to the SFC&RFS mode, the GSA-based cost optimization offers a 21.46% increase in revenue growth, while it is improved to 38.7% using proposed MTDE algorithm. The paper also addresses the significance of fuzzy logic based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of solar PV in enhancing the energy management of the proposed system. The prototype of fuzzy logic MPPT for 10 W solar panel is presented and the tracked maximum power is visualized using Thingspeak IoT cloud server. The tracking speed of the MPPT can be increased by introducing machine learning algorithms at the cost of memory and complexity. In this article, the linear regression-based machine learning algorithm is implemented in the hardware prototype by utilizing the dataset aggregated from fuzzy MPPT and hence the proposed MPPT inherits the characteristics of the fuzzy MPPT with increased tracking speed. Around 75 % data are used for training, 25% of data are used to test the model and it is observed that the root mean square error (rmse) is 5.1334 and mean square error is 26.3521 and the model is utilized as MPPT for the real-time inputs. © 2024, University of Sistan and Baluchestan.

AB  - Home energy management systems are essential for the optimization of resources in complex demand scheduling problems that require energy efficiency in homes. This can be achieved through the use of Renewable Electricity Sources (RES), for cleaner and more sustainable energy generation, as well as participation in Demand Response (DR) programs, for lower energy prices. The problem becomes more complex when it is considered a community of households. This paper aims to address individual and community household participation in DR programs and RES sharing while considering constraints imposed on the operation schedule of appliances, through load shifting optimization. For that, a Genetic Algorithm is proposed, implemented, and validated, which focuses on minimizing energy costs. It takes into account dynamic pricing, distributed generation, and household community energy sharing. Using real household workload data, two case studies are presented, one for the cost optimization of an individual household and another for a photovoltaic energy-sharing household community containing twenty houses. Both case studies represent five days of scheduling, where each house can have up to five appliances able to shift. The business as usual costs are 16.74 EUR and 269.99 EUR for the individual and community case studies, respectively. Results show improvements of up to 24.3% (12.67 EUR in the optimized schedule, 4.07 EUR in savings) for the individual case study and 11.8% (238.21 EUR in the optimized schedule, 31.78 EUR in savings) for the household community. In a community, households can expect cost reductions of 1.5%–26.8% when compared to individual scheduling. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - In 2018, the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) introduced Building Renovation Passports (BRP) to enable buildings to scale energy performance through a Scheduled Renovations Roadmap (SRR). The Digital Building Logbook (DBL) was introduced in 2021 as a repository of relevant building data to facilitate informed decision-making and information sharing among stakeholders. In Spain, both tools (DBL + SRR) have been studied separately in an incipient way. However, the interconnection of data in the tools come from the same document base. Evidence suggests that when building information is used in isolation, its value is diluted without stakeholder awareness. In this paper, we move towards unifying both tools (DBL+SRR) in a single comprehensive tool called the Libro del Edificio Electrónico (LdE-e), with the aim of producing a single building database to drive multi-building renovations. For this purpose, the data fields of existing building information, assessment and management tools in Spain were studied in detail and reinterpreted in a new interconnected data structure. To evaluate the formulation of the LdE-e proposal, 11 semi-structured interviews were held with a panel of 13 experts specialized in real estate, building and energy efficiency. After these sessions, the LdE-e was reformulated, and the model was strengthened by analyzing vectors such as governance, management, usability, data flows, stakeholders and the impact of including new technologies such as BIM and blockchain. The results suggest that the LdE-e would improve control of the operation and maintenance of (new or existing) buildings, the programming of renovation actions based on deficits identified in technical inspections, and other aspects. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Urbanization has led to an uneven distribution of adequate, safe, and affordable housing as the global population converges on cities. Many cities are faced with significant housing price disparities. Housing flexibility can reduce the cost of housing and meet the human need for comfort, health, safety, and a sense of community in housing, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Principles. As a result, experts and academics in the architectural design field are increasingly focusing their interest on this matter. This paper offers a bibliometric analysis of all Scopus database publications pertaining to housing flexibility from 2010 to 2021 and energy efficiency characterization. The status of research on housing flexibility in sustainability research is further discussed. The study uncovers yearly research publications, average citation rates, locally cited literature, prominent information sources, corresponding author countries, domestic scientific output, and a global representation of international collaborations. Overall, this research offers an in-depth description of the subjects and methodologies within the most frequently cited articles. © 2024 Tiantian et al.

AB  - Social housing in Spain has its origin in the first Cheap Houses Law that was promulgated in 1911, trying to provide a solution to a housing need for the working class who flocked to the cities in waves of migration from rural areas. Since then, legislative initiatives have been taking place to mitigate the housing problem. Each one of them was contributing elements that presumably contributed to the hygiene and habitability of the house without forgetting the economic conditions. At the moment, in Spain there is a large real estate park inherited from these initiatives. In many cases, these are neighborhoods that currently show notable energy and social vulnerability. Aware of the need to adapt these homes to the regulatory requirements related to energy efficiency, comfort and the physical and technical characteristics of the construction, the Research Centers are developing multiple investigations aimed at favoring the adaptability of homes and improving the quality of life of its inhabitants. This article takes a tour of the evolution that social housing has had during the 20th century in Spain and the current state of research aimed at adapting it to the new energy, habitability and sustainability requirements. © 2023, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia..

AB  - To meet European carbon neutrality targets and comply with building energy performance regulations, renovating historic buildings is considered one of the most challenging tasks for the construction sector. On one hand, commonly employed renovation solutions are often more difficult to implement on these structures. On the other hand, renovation work must be carried out while preserving their heritage value and integrity. The European standard EN 16883 on conservation and energy renovation performance of cultural heritage was developed in 2017 with the aim of facilitating energy performance improvements in historic buildings while respecting their cultural significance. In pursuit of the same objective, the “P-Renewal” project focuses on the energy retrofit of pre-war Walloon housing with heritage value, providing valuable support through a reflective process and decision-making tools. These tools enable the selection of renovation strategies that effectively combine the preservation of heritage value with improvements in internal comfort, energy efficiency, and environmental performance. This study compares the reflective process of the research project with the guidelines of the standard EN 16883 and discusses the transferability of this contribution to other European contexts. This will significantly contribute to the evolution of energy performance standards for the renovation of historic buildings. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The diffusion of renewable energy technology, such as solar home systems (SHS), has great potential to reduce GHG emissions. However, households’ energy efficiency (EE) and curtailment behavior (CB) play a crucial role in this process. This study examines the rooftop solar PV potential, households’ willingness to adopt SHS, and their EE/CB implications for mitigating CO2 emissions through SHS adoption. A survey of 216 households was carried out alongside rooftop solar PV potential analysis in a high-income gated estate and a middle-class neighborhood using secondary data. First, we find that rooftop solar PV has the potential to offset all grid electricity and its associated CO2 emissions for at least 63.5% of households. Secondly, the willingness to adopt SHS is lower in the high-income neighborhood than the middle-class ones. This dynamic is explained by the occupancy status, where most of those in the high-income neighborhood tend to be renters – a group known to have a low willingness to adopt SHS. Thirdly, our results affirm that energy-saving behavior is more common in a middle-class neighborhood where the propensity to adopt SHS is also high. Our results suggest that households willing to adopt SHS are more likely to engage in EE/CB. However, this tendency is common among middle-class households, who, in practice, may not be able to afford the SHS. Our findings underscore the need for more targeted policy interventions for SHS, and EE and CB among homeowners, high-income neighborhoods, and real estate developers. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - In this study, we assess the tangible effects of building energy efficiency standards, a prevalent residential energy efficiency policy globally. Employing comprehensive household-level data (N=84,864) from Turkey, we analyze the heterogeneous impacts of building codes on the energy consumption of houses equipped with diverse heating technologies. Our findings reveal that, on average, building codes result in an approximate six percent reduction in heating energy demand for houses constructed after the regulation. Notably, this effect is statistically significant solely for homes featuring collective central heating systems within multi-family buildings. Conversely, the policy has no significant impact on energy demand for houses using stoves, individual boilers, or electricity-based heating systems. We suggest that the aforementioned outcome may be partially attributed to potential “rebound” and “pre-bound” effects stemming from the decreased heating costs in newer dwellings. Moreover, the observed influence on dwellings equipped with collective central heating systems can be attributed to the compulsory installation of individual meters in newer constructions. This incentivizes households to limit their energy consumption when compared to older properties where heating costs are distributed evenly among residents. These findings underscore the importance of behavioral interventions in shaping effective energy-saving policies. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effectiveness of residential energy efficiency policies may vary across countries, contingent on the distribution of heating systems in the building sector and a country's economic development level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the main tools to achieve the promise of carbon neutrality is the energy transition. Reducing dependence on traditional energy and promoting the use of renewable energy drives changes in the energy sector and contributes to the energy transition. The building sector is strongly linked to energy consumption and retrofitting the building sector with natural gas energy is a positive energy efficiency strategy. This research aimed to determine the factors influencing social housing tenants in the Netherlands to participate in retrofits and to identify the differences among participants in their preferences. Using a stated choice experiment and discrete choice model, 380 effective social housing tenants in the Netherlands participated. The estimated Mixed Logit Model (MLM) reveals the preferences of social housing residents, and the Latent Class Model (LCM) indicates differences between latent groups. The results show that social housing residents are attracted by saving total housing costs, enhancing living comfort, providing a new bathroom, kitchen and toilet of individual houses and improving the neighbourhood environment. Meanwhile, they are resistant to the interference generated during the renovation process. These findings can be used to guide government and housing organisations in developing retrofit programs that align with the needs and preferences of social housing tenants. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investment trend is supported by criteria that serve as benchmarks used by socially conscious investors to evaluate potential investments. Within these criteria, energy efficiency, green buildings, and transparency in ESG performance reporting are becoming increasingly important. There is an increased demand for properties that meet these criteria, and building owners and managers are realizing their importance. For this reason, more and more property owners and managers are integrating these green features into their properties. The ESG trilemma in Romania is becoming popular among companies in full development and which aim to apply energy efficiency measures, cost reduction and profit growth while maintaining their performance at a high level. Monitoring of ESG principles in implementation to ensure the balance among the vertices of the triangle and energy management of the buildings from a portfolio represent our contribution to the research. ©2023 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Decision-makers' perceptions, influenced by institutional and organizational pressures, shape sustainability action. However, the current body of research on the impact of these pressures within the real estate sector, particularly among real estate owner organizations, remains limited. Research argument: This explorative study fills the research gap by providing empirical findings and theoretical interpretation that explains the influence and outcomes of institutional pressures on decision-making processes. Methodological approach: Explorative surveys and interviews were conducted with asset managers in Sweden to understand their sustainability perceptions and actions within the real estate sector. Main findings: The study found a notable shift in sustainability perceptions among asset managers in Sweden, with most recognizing sustainability as critical for commercial real estate, challenging the notion of their passivity and highlighting their proactive engagement. Economic incentives significantly influence sustainability actions, with top priorities being energy efficiency and renewable energy due to their positive business impact. Other sustainability actions are also important but not prioritized to the same extent, revealing specific priorities within real estate owner organizations, an area less explored in prior research. Conclusion: The article proposes a theoretical framework to guide future research on how institutional and organizational mechanisms shape decision-makers' sustainability perceptions, guiding sustainability action. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for implementing Sustainable Development Goals in practice across industries. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - The article explores the relationship between social inequalities and the energy transition in the Barcelona metropolitan area. Thus, it analyzes to what extent the necessary process of improving energy efficiency and decarbonization can be associated not with a reduction but with an increase in inequalities. On the one hand, it is confirmed that the population with the lowest incomes resides in inefficient real estate parks and has a lower propensity than the average to take measures to improve the said situation. On the other hand, the more affluent areas have a greater propensity to implement self-generated electricity systems, as well as a greater presence of electric vehicles. The territorial concentration processes of both situations can come to consolidate social inequality and spatial seg-regation, which makes it necessary to adopt corrective policies. © 2023, Ministerio de Fomento.

AB  - Recent studies indicate that houses with higher energy efficiency usually have higher market prices, a ‘market premium for energy efficiency’. But in Germany the usefulness of this premium is confounded by the ‘prebound effect’: the gap between officially certificated energy ratings and actual energy consumption. Attempts have been made to close this gap from two complementary directions: downwards, by obtaining more accurate and less pessimistic technical estimates of idealised energy performance; and upwards, by estimating how much energy occupants realistically need for health and comfort. This study investigates prebound effects alongside an analysis of house prices in Germany, using a large database of house sale advertisements from 2007 to 2021, focusing on pre-1980 homes that were re-sold in 2019–2021. It uses ordinary least-squared multivariate regression to estimate market premiums for energy efficiency and sets these alongside estimates of prebound (and rebound) effects. It finds that prebound effects can lead purchasers to overestimate future energy savings and therefore pay more for properties than their actual worth. It also offers simple models to help purchasers interpret energy ratings more critically and estimate likely energy savings more realistically. Finally, it suggests how policymakers could modify energy ratings to reflect likely energy consumption more accurately. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Produced water is an inevitable by-product from oil wells and the challenge lies in how to best manage it both economically and environmentally. A large cluster in the South of Oman with around 30 fields and more than 2000 active wells has a daily water production rate of more than 100,000 m3/d. Management of this produced water is crucial in prolonging oil production and maximizing recovery from these fields. A certain strategy is being followed where different initiatives are taken to manage the produced water. The water management strategy been followed is to Reduce, Relocate and Reuse, the 3 Rs. The 3 Rs strategy has been implemented in the cluster by taking the initiatives below: 1. REDUCE: Implementation of Autonomous Inflow Control Valves Technology: which has resulted in an average water reduction of 70% while increasing the oil production by 10% where implemented. It has also resulted in lower water management costs and lower Green-house Gases intensity. 2. REDUCE: Frequent Well-by-Well economic evaluation: where all oil wells are screened in terms of economical oil cut-off breakeven value with respect to well operating cost and then re-visiting the identified wells. The economic screening also accounts for CO2 penalties to drive GHG and energy efficiency. As well as continuous waterflood optimization by carrying out structured reviews, to promote high efficiency injectors and demote low efficiency injectors. 3. REUSE: Increasing waterflooded reservoirs' throughput rate: less Deep-Water Disposal and hence less power consumption for DWD pumps and lower fields' Greenhouse Gases intensity. 4. REUSE: Water re-allocation and use for agriculture/biofuel and other industrial use building on successful projects across Oman. This type of use provides great enablers for deep water disposal phase-out, hence positive impact on GHG & energy management. Taking such initiatives has resulted in reducing Deep Water Disposal, optimization of rates (balancing offtake/intake) as an output of the Well-by-Well economic evaluation and an increase in oil production as an output of technology implementation. This has also led to reducing Greenhouse Gases Emissions, minimizing energy inputs, and reducing treatment costs since these initiatives are directly linked to Energy Management.

AB  - Building sustainability has become a major objective in architecture due to buildings’ significant contribution to the environment degradation. Like many other nations, South Korea has inaugurated the Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design (G–SEED) to address the issue of environmental loads caused by energy inefficient buildings. Due to the additional construction cost needed to obtain G–SEED certification, building stakeholders face challenges in deciding whether to invest in green building certification. In this study, we evaluate the existence and magnitude of the G–SEED price premium in Seoul, one of most densely populated cities in South Korea. We applied the hedonic pricing model to an extensive dataset of all housing transactions made during 2018 in all 25 districts of Seoul. Our findings indicate that the average price premium for a G–SEED certified apartment is 24.3%, with the premium being 18.3%, 31.0%, and 54.6% for small, medium, and large apartment complexes, respectively. We conclude that although the additional cost required to meet G–SEED certification criteria increases with the size of the development; green investment is profitable at all scales considered in this study. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - While the literature confirms the existence of a green premium, various researchers have acknowledged the importance of homogeneity in the dataset used for premium assessment. This study developed a systematic approach to extract a sales subsample containing transactions from green-certified apartments and their most similar counterparts based on cluster analysis. The study applied k-means and PAM clustering algorithms to split an extensive sales sample of 81,605 transactions into sales subsamples. A sales subsample containing transactions from green-certified apartments and their peers was extracted and used for green premium estimation. The results indicate that through cluster analysis, a market segment containing above 80% of the total housing transactions from green-certified apartments could be identified. Through the hedonic model, a green premium of 26.2% was identified from the entire sales sample (no market segmentation). However, this value was reduced to 12.2 and 17.8% when estimated from a sales subsample extracted through k-means and PAM clustering, respectively. These findings have implications for the close assessment of green certification impact on the sale prices. In addition, they can also serve as an indicator of housing categories that need extra effort to promote green practices in that particular market segment. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The paper presents the analysis results of the concept of integrated, “sustainable” development of the area of the old airport complex in the city of Rostov-on-Don. The accounting of the predictive level of energy resources consumption of a conditional site on the territory of the airport renovation at the maximum and minimum density of its development with high, medium, and low-rise buildings is performed. The change in the energy load on utility networks from the real estate objects planned for construction, depending on the level of their energy efficiency, is calculated. Measures are proposed to reduce the energy intensity of buildings based on the application of the European practice in this area. Using the example of calculating the energy load of a conditional area of the renovation, the value of possible savings of energy resources in the amount of 78.5% was obtained, depending on the accepted model of building density. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Household energy-saving interventions are essential in reducing energy consumption in residential buildings. One of the effective interventions is Household Energy-Saving Option (HESO). However, the pricing strategy of this innovative intervention has not been explored. This study aims to establish a feasible valuation strategy for HESO to facilitate the application of market-based energy-saving interventions among households. This study first provides a pricing strategy of HESO from a market zero-profit perspective. It continues by developing a price cap and floor for HESO's market price. The theoretical pricing model was validated by a field experiment consisting of two-tiered HESO trading among 67 households in Singapore. The results revealed decisive implications for both environmental policymakers and HESO suppliers. Policymakers are suggested to launch HESO in countries or regions with stable and relatively high electricity prices and low discount rates. HESO suppliers may choose to adjust rewards and duration accordingly when the market price deviates from the zero-profit equilibrium price of HESO. The valuation strategy of HESO also helps quantitative estimation of households' perceived value of HESO. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.
