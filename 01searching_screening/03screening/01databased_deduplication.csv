While studies have examined the presence of sustainability messages in advertising in general, and in a number of discrete industries, the use of these messages in residential property advertising is critically understudied. Some homebuyers, however, appear interested in these messages, as evidence suggests they ascribe value to certain sustainability claims and features. An analysis of the textual and visual content of 100 property adverts for city centre flats, listed for sale in two English cities in early 2022, afforded detailed insights into the positioning of sustainability in residential real estate advertising. Findings from this analysis indicate that explicit sustainability messages are rare. Property and locational features related to environmental sustainability are mentioned more frequently than those related to social sustainability. Features related to economic sustainability are discussed in adverts targeted at property investors. Sparse explicit discussion of sustainability in adverts might imply that there is little general concern for this issue, either amongst those selling property and/or amongst those buying property. An implication of this might be that pro-sustainability measures targeted at the housing sector may encounter a muted response from actors within the sector, potentially frustrating the implementation of those measures. For homebuyers who are interested in a property's sustainability, the findings suggest that they are poorly served by current practices in property advertising. Estate agents and developers wishing to appeal to these sustainability-minded consumers might do well to incorporate greater commentary on a property's sustainability features in their advertising materials.",2023-01,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,1,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000908639800001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to determine the original features and reveal the value of Alanya rural architecture within the framework of the sustainability principles, and to determine how these values have changed with the unqualified interventions, by detailing qualitatively and quantitatively on the basis of each intervention. Within the scope of the study, the rural architectural heritage in Alanya has been documented in terms of settlement texture, space organization, architectural elements, material, construction and energy efficiency. For the analysis, a rural house that preserves its original values was used. A comparison was made between the values of this house and the values obtained as a result of the changes in the other buildings in the area. In cases where these interventions are applied in various variations, the changes in the heating and cooling load of the house are compared with the CO2 emission. It has been determined that the rural houses of Alanya provide energy conservation in a way that is perfected by tradition, both in terms of settlement features and space and materials on the basis of structure. It has been determined that the heating/cooling energy requirement can decrease but the CO2 emission increases in the individual changes made by evaluating different types of deterioration. When the most common application variations detected in the field are evaluated, it has been determined that both the heating/cooling energy requirement and the CO2 emission have increased. Rural settlements and residences define an architecture that has reached the highest level in terms of convenience, functionality and economy. Since any intervention to these structures means the loss of their energy conservation properties as well as their originality, a very careful decision should be made. The study reveals the first data in which the rural architecture of Alanya is evaluated within the scope of sustainability and energy and CO2 emissions are compared depending on deterioration/changes.",2022-12,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,614-639,,2,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000907131500010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a comparatively mild climate cold homes are a significant problem in the UK, with a recent estimate finding that over one-quarter of low-income households had been unable to adequately heat their home in winter 2022. The magnitude of cold housing in a country that benefits from a mild climate indicates indifference towards, or acceptance of, a significant minority of people living in inadequate conditions on the part of policy makers. Cold homes are therefore a source of social harm. Recent changes to the household energy price cap, the rising cost of living, the ongoing effects of the benefit cap, and below inflation uprating to social security benefits is likely to greatly exacerbate this issue. In this research we use data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study to explore whether living in a cold home causes mental health harm. We control for mental distress and housing temper-ature on entry to the survey in order to account for the potentially bi-directional relationship. Multilevel discrete -time event history models show that the transition into living in a home that is not suitably warm is associated with nearly double the odds of experiencing severe mental distress for those who had no mental distress at the beginning of the survey; and over three times the odds of severe mental distress for those previously on the borderline of severe mental distress. These results show the significant costs of failing to ensure that people are able to live in homes in which they are able to live comfortably by even the most basic standards. These costs will be felt not just individually, but also more broadly in terms of increased health spending and reduced working.",2022-12,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,314,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000903743700013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we have found that capital market funds are commonly used by the Swedish public and the largest private housing companies. Bonds are less costly compared to bank loans, and green bonds are 0.02-0.03 percentage points less costly than conventional bonds.

The transaction costs are estimated based on time assessment, income levels and monetary expenditures occurring in the decision process. The results suggest that the magnitude of the transaction costs can be an important barrier to energy renovations.

The aim of this study is to conduct a parametric evaluation of courtyard design variants in a residential building of different climates with a focus on indoor thermal comfort and utility costs. A brute-force approach is applied to generate a wide range of design alter-natives and the simulation workflow is conducted by Grasshopper together with the environ-mental plugins Ladybug and Honeybee. The main study objective is the evaluation of the occupant thermal comfort in an air-conditioned residential building, energy load, and cost analysis, derived from different design variables including courtyard geometry, window-to -wall ratio, envelope materials, heating, and cooling set-point dead-bands, and building geographical location. Furthermore, a Deep Learning model is developed using the inputs and outputs of the simulation and analysis to transform the outcomes into the algorithmic and tangible environment feasible for predictive applications. The results suggest that regarding the thermal loads, costs, and indoor thermal comfort index (PMV), there are high correlations between the outdoor weather variation and dead-band ranges, while in extreme climates such as Singapore, courtyard spaces might not be efficient enough as expected. Finally, the highly accurate deep learning model is also developed, delivering superior predic-tive capabilities for the thermal comfort and utility costs of the courtyard designs.(c) 2022 Higher Education Press Limited Company.

The present paper focuses on regulatory barriers viewed from the perspective of construction industry experts in achieving sustainable buildings. Design/methodology/approach The present study uses a qualitative research method and semi-structured interviews as a research instrument. The present study interviews around 20 experts in construction and property management, property development, spatial planning and energy management. Findings The study finds that Kosovo building laws and regulations provide for the materials assessment criteria, but the materials assessment criteria are only for mechanic strength. The study further finds that the sustainability concept is not included and incorporated in Kosovo's urban planning laws and regulations. The study also finds that despite specific clauses mentioning energy performance certificates in the Law on Energy Performance of Buildings in Kosovo, energy performance certificates appears to be not enforced and the nature of the barrier is more organizational rather than regulatory. Finally, the study finds that Kosovo laws are silent as far as green labeling of building materials is concerned. Practical implications The implication of the present finding is that policymakers in Kosovo not only should include clear sustainable materials assessment criteria in the law, but also enforce those criteria through testing and inspection mechanisms included in the law and implemented in practice through funding and organizational support. Nonetheless, policymakers in Kosovo should contemplate amending the urban planning laws in Kosovo and include both the term of sustainability at the planning level and conformity guidelines for sustainable design that can be done at the administrative directive level. Further, the clauses in the law do not suffice if the clauses are not accompanied by specific systemic and organizational support in the issuance of energy performance certificates. Policymakers in Kosovo should be proactive in designing clauses that specify green labeling standards for materials; however, these labeling standards should not adversely affect the cost of construction and reduce the demand for real estate. Originality/value The study is the first qualitative study about the perception of construction professionals in Kosovo, regarding the regulatory barriers of sustainable buildings in Kosovo.",,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000858614300001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach The data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach was used to measure the relative operational efficiency of the studied assets in relation to the revenue performance. This method could produce a more informed and balanced approach to performance measurement. Findings The outcomes show that scores of efficiencies ranging from 7% to 99% in some of the models. The results showed that on average buildings are 75% relatively less efficient in maintenance, in term of revenue generation, than the benchmark set. Likewise, on average, the inefficient buildings are 60% relatively less efficient in insurance. Result also shows that 95% of the building assets in the sample are by and large operating at decreasing returns to scale. This implies that managers need to considerably reduce the operational resources (input) to improve the levels of revenue. Research limitations/implications This study recommends that the FM operational variables that were found to inefficiently contribute to the revenue should be re-examined to test the validity of the findings. This is necessary before generalising or interpolating the results that are presented in this study. Practical implications The information obtained about operational performance can help FM managers to understand which improvements in the productivity of inefficient FM resources are required, providing insight into how to reduce operating costs and increase revenue.

Like many other nations, South Korea has inaugurated the Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design (G-SEED) to address the issue of environmental loads caused by energy inefficient buildings. Due to the additional construction cost needed to obtain G-SEED certification, building stakeholders face challenges in deciding whether to invest in green building certification. In this study, we evaluate the existence and magnitude of the G-SEED price premium in Seoul, one of most densely populated cities in South Korea. We applied the hedonic pricing model to an extensive dataset of all housing transactions made during 2018 in all 25 districts of Seoul. Our findings indicate that the average price premium for a G-SEED certified apartment is 24.3%, with the premium being 18.3%, 31.0%, and 54.6% for small, medium, and large apartment complexes, respectively. We conclude that although the additional cost required to meet G-SEED certification criteria increases with the size of the development; green investment is profitable at all scales considered in this study.",,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000804689900001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, three commonly available insulation materials were experimentally evaluated for a case study of residential buildings, located in a cold region of Pakistan. Glass wool, extruded polystyrene, and polyethylene were used, as insulation materials, for monitoring the case study building performance. Thermal data were collected for 21 days in the year 2019 using a Testo Saveries System and were then used for analyzing the thermal performance of each of the three types of insulation materials. Other relevant data including the cost of insulation materials, thickness, ease of application, design life, and fire resistance of the selected insulation materials were obtained for broader (based on the scorecard) analysis based on a multi-weighted decision model. It was concluded that Polyethylene was the most economical insulation material amongst the others, which also showed the best thermal performance.

As landlords are the primary decision-makers for improving rental properties, understanding their energy efficiency behaviour is critical to improving the uptake of energy efficiency retrofits in the private rental sector. However, little is known about how landlords make decisions about energy efficiency retrofits. The study aims to understand when and why landlords decide to retrofit and identify policy implications, using the private rental sector in Victoria as a case study. The results show that proactive retrofitting by landlords is rare and that the retrofits undertaken were generally low-cost, incremental energy efficiency improvements. Most retrofit activity was prompted by gov-ernment subsidies, tenant requests, or appliance breakdown. Despite its significance for energy efficiency, ret-rofitting behaviour was not related to environmental values. Instead, landlords considered financial implications and tenants' needs. However, landlords who used property managers had little understanding of tenants' needs. Policymakers can use this understanding of landlords' behaviour by creating new retrofit prompts and high-lighting the impacts of energy inefficiency on tenants' wellbeing. Transitioning the private rental sector to low-energy housing requires integrated policy to change the behaviour of landlords, tenants, and property managers.",2022-06,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000786607100001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Swiss CO2 levy on heating fuels was introduced in 2008 at CHF 12/tCO(2)eq, and was increased steadily up to CHF 84/tCO(2)eq during the period of 2016/2017. This paper investigated the effectiveness of the levy as an instrument to reduce heating fuel demand, and hence carbon emissions, of private real estate owners. The Swiss Household Budget Survey 2006-2017 constituted the main data source. Before-after and pseudo-panel regressions were used to capture the CO2 levy's effects, and a large set of household characteristics, as well as climatic conditions, were controlled for. No significant effects in the first two policy periods of 2008-2013 were found. Over the period of 2014-2017, a significant reduction in house owners' heating fuel demand of up to 14% with respect to 2006-2007 was detected. The effect was less significant and smaller in magnitude for flat owners. A significant CO2 levy semielasticity of heating fuel demand of -1.3% for house owners was further estimated. Hence, the results confirmed the effectiveness of the CO2 levy under the conditions that the levy was sufficiently high, as during the years of 2014-2017, and households directly paid the levy and were responsible for decisions concerning heating and insulation, as was the case for house owners.",2022-05,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,9,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000794541500001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electrification would be implemented by using vapour-compression heat pumps, which are currently experiencing market growth in many countries. On the other hand, hydrogen could substitute natural gas in boilers or be used in thermally-driven absorption heat pumps. In this paper, a consistent thermodynamic and economic methodology is developed to assess the competitiveness of these options. The three technologies, along with the option of district heating, are for the first time compared for different weather/ambient conditions and fuel-price scenarios, first from a homeowner's and then from a whole-energy system perspective. For the former, two-dimensional decision maps are generated to identify the most cost-effective technologies for different combinations of fuel prices. It is shown that, in the UK, hydrogen technologies are economically favourable if hydrogen is supplied to domestic end-users at a price below half of the electricity price. Otherwise, electrification and the use of conventional electric heat pumps will be preferred. From a whole-energy system perspective, the total system cost per household (which accounts for upstream generation and storage, as well as technology investment, installation and maintenance) associated with electric heat pumps varies between 790 and 880 & POUND;/year for different scenarios, making it the least-cost decarbonisation pathway. If hydrogen is produced by electrolysis, the total system cost associated with hydrogen technologies is notably higher, varying between 1410 and 1880 & POUND;/year.

Green building development in residential sector is relatively slow. This paper provides nuanced evidence for explaining the slow growth of green residential building (GRB) based on a case study of the market in Shenzhen. This paper uses hedonic pricing models with a unique transaction dataset to find out an average price discount of 11.94% for GRB in second-hand housing market. Such price discount of GRB grows as housing price rises, insinuating that expensive housing obtains greater economic loss from green label. Our findings drawn from employing heterogeneity analysis show that the GRBs being sold in spring and winter tend to have a smaller price discount than those sold in summer and autumn. The GRBs with more rooms and parlors, however, tend to have a greater price discount in second-hand housing market. Our findings confirm that both building age and distance to central business district (CBD) offset the value loss resulting from green label.

Although electricity is an essential product in our daily life, reductions of electricity demand have generally been defended on environmental and energy security grounds. The aim of this paper is to analyse the level and the drivers of efficiency in household electricity consumption using an estimator for endogenous stochastic frontiers. A panel of data is built for this purpose, using statistical matching techniques with seven waves of the Spanish Household Budget Survey (SHBS) from 2006 to 2012. Several economic and non-economic variables are considered, including income, household features and characteristics of the dwelling. Our findings suggest that the level of electricity efficiency is already relatively high for households in all income levels. The results also reveal that there is a negative relation between income and efficiency in electricity consumption, i.e., that the lowest income households are also the most efficient. Furthermore, one feature of dwellings (the number of rooms) and two features of households (their size and the educational level) are relevant drivers of household efficiency in electricity consumption. Whereas the educational level and household size negatively affect electricity efficiency, the number of rooms positively influences efficiency. Our findings suggest that general price-based measures which drive the adoption of electricity efficient technologies and behaviors should be complemented with two types of policy interventions: policies which encourage households to be more efficient (i.e., information pro-vision and financial support for the adoption of electricity-efficient practices) and measures specifically targeted at low-income households which mitigate the comparatively greater distributional impact of price increases on this household segment.",2022-05,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,164,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000788098500006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper explores valuers' perceptions of the relationships between sustainability and market values, sustainability and valuation variables, and the value influence of industry sustainability certification schemes. Further, this paper tracks prevalence of certified buildings in Australian commercial markets and the evolution of valuers' knowledge of sustainability certifications used in Australia. Design/methodology/approach This paper reports on the next rendition of a longitudinal study examining valuers' practice in Australia. This research explores the evolution of Australian valuers' perception and knowledge of sustainability in valuation practice. The survey data has been periodically collected from practising valuers from 2007 to 2021. The survey questions investigate valuers' knowledge development, understanding, reporting and consideration of the relationship between sustainability and market value. Findings The results have identified the evolution of the influence of normative research on valuers' perceptions of the relationship between sustainability and value; with a clearer understanding emerging over time of where the value relationships are identified in valuation variables. Greater alignment between empirical Australian studies and valuers' perceptions of the influence of sustainability ratings on value, demonstrate the value connection for higher rated buildings under NABERS (energy rating) and Green Star. Whilst only 41% of the study's participants are including sustainability in their valuation reports, they include a higher level of commentary on building descriptions and initiatives, building ratings, and reporting of owner and tenant objectives, than in previous studies. Knowledge development relating to sustainability certification tool, NABERS was identified. This is likely linked to the introduction of mandatory disclosure legislation. This has also led to increased awareness and valuers' knowledge of the differences between the two key rating tools used in Australia. Research limitations/implications The research has several limitations: firstly, recruitment of valuers and the number of valuers' responses has varied over time; secondly, due to collection methods respondents have a greater likelihood of having an interest in and knowledge of sustainability creating potential for positive bias; thirdly, respondents may have responded to the survey in different years, but due to anonymity there has been no ability to track this. The results provide insights into the Australian valuation profession but may not be fully representative of the profession overall in Australia. Practical implications The broader agenda of net zero, climate change, mitigation and carbon requirements, whether driven by market forces or government legislation, are generating changes in property markets as investors' reconsider their positions and model the implications of carbon emissions on their bottom lines. Introductions of policy and legislation over time in the Australian context have led to changes in valuation practice and increasing consideration of energy efficiency and ratings in the valuation of assets. However, further guidance and research still is required in Australia to assist in the knowledge development of valuers, and their ability to consider the emerging effects of sustainability, net zero and other market driven objectives including legislation, and how these may affect or influence their evaluation of market evidence and thus property values. Originality/value The research has tracked valuers' understanding, knowledge, and consideration of sustainability and energy efficiency in valuation practice since 2007. In that time the research has found that, as the market has evolved and more rated buildings are built (or retrofitted), so too has valuers' knowledge and consideration in valuation practices evolved. Valuers are more engaged with industry rating tools such as NABERS. This suggests that the Australian mandatory disclosure policies have contributed to changes in the market, which are then interpreted by valuers and reflected in their perceptions and consideration of energy ratings in valuation practice.",,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000769383300001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst earlier publications both industry and academic publications alike focussed on the normative aspects of how sustainability should affect value, more recent research starts to ascertain the implications of sustainability on property values.

The results of the study showed that, in Australia, buildings with NABERS rating of 4 stars and above delivered a higher total return compared with buildings with lower NABERS ratings. This also supports the Freeman's (1984) social impact hypothesis in which favorable social performance will ultimately lead to favorable financial performance. In addition, our empirical modelling results also demonstrated the premium of green buildings is stronger since the launch of CBDP, reflecting the importance of mandatory building efficiency disclosure.

However, scant research has been conducted on energy-saving literacy amongst Ghanaian households. To substantiate the problem, this paper aims to examine energy conservation literacy and behaviours among Ghanaian households in the Greater Accra Region. Design/methodology/approach The study assessed household electricity use and explored determinants of household energy conservation behaviours. Data was collected through a survey administered to households within the target region and analysed using descriptive statistics and Spearmen's rank correlation. Findings Results showed electricity conservation among households is greatly influenced by the number of household occupants, household income levels, and the quality and quantity of appliances. The study also found that conservation behaviours are positively correlated to the number of occupants, household income levels, the quantity of electrical appliances, age of household members, number of rooms and level of urbanization within the home's geographical region. Cumulatively, the findings suggest households held positive attitudes towards efficient energy practices. Enigmatically, the use of energy-conserving alternative technologies was not widely used by households; hence, this factor does not significantly affect household energy conservation. Research limitations/implications Although limited to Ghana's capital region, the findings can be used to inform policy and regulations at the regional and national levels in designing an efficient and effective mechanism to reduce the country's overall energy use.

This research compares the profitability of building renovation companies and companies specializing in new construction using financial statement analysis and analysis of variance. Profitability is assessed through EBITDA and return on assets (ROA). Debt to equity (D/E) ratio as a solvency measure supports the analysis. The findings show micro and small companies in the new building sector have a statistically significant advantage in EBITDA over renovation in same size groups; projects in the renovation sector appear to be more complex, especially in terms of design, causing cost overruns. The more cyclical nature of new construction, however, equalizes EBITDA differences over time. Medium-size companies overall had the lowest EBITDA following the 2008-2009 financial crisis. ROA was generally higher for the renovation sector highlighting the more capital-intensive nature of new construction; unsold apartments and land for future projects hold capital, which results in higher D/E ratios.

Based on this result, in order to expand GR for low-income elderly households, who cannot afford to perform GR, a GR support measure linked to the currently implemented energy conversion and old-age housing support policies was proposed. It allows the government to perform GR for low-income elderly households with 1/4 of the total construction cost.

The studied population was divided into four groups depending on area under rapeseed cultivation rates. The selected farms were located in voivodeships with the highest rapeseed acreage rates of the total cropped area. The economic performance of the examined farms improved with increases in rapeseed area. Farms with larger rapeseed areas were characterized by higher production values and better economic performance. On average, the total production value per farm was highest in the group of farms with rapeseed areas of 20.1-30 ha. Similar results were noted when total production values were expressed per ha of arable land, per full-time employee and per man-hour. Total production value was lowest in farms with the smallest rapeseed areas. Farms with the largest areas under rapeseed cultivation achieved the highest farm household income. The farm household income values per full-time employee and per man-hour were highest in farms with the largest areas under rapeseed cultivation. The values of fixed assets and current assets increased with increases in rapeseed area. Most farms were run by owners with secondary school education. The highest percentages of farmers with university education were noted in farms with rapeseed areas of 10-20.1 ha (37.5%) and above 30 ha (30.4%). The vast majority of farms from all groups were run by male farmers.

Much previous research on building performance has focussed on large-scale construction. However, retrofit of existing housing stock - which will contribute the majority of the requisite efficiency improvement - is carried out by practitioners in the repair-maintain-improve (RMI) subsector. These practitioners are the sole traders and micro-firms who constitute two-fifths of employment in the construction sector. The study aims to examine the factors influencing these practitioners in RMI work to understand how better to engage them with improved building performance. Design/methodology/approach A total of 31 semi-structured interviews were conducted with RMI professionals from around the UK and analysed using template analysis. Findings The analysis identified capabilities of the practitioners who influence building performance, including knowledge and co-ordination of people and resources; opportunities including state action and customer demand; and motivations including pride in work, customer care and satisfaction, maintaining a viable business and working relationships. Research limitations/implications The participants were a small, mixed group in terms of firm size and specialisation. The qualitative approach adopted provided detailed insights but does not make claims for statistical generalisability or representativeness of the findings. Future work could look to extend the findings with a statistically representative survey. Practical implications For a successful transition to high standards of building performance, modelling is not enough. Initiatives are needed to address the multiple factors which determine engagement in energy-efficient retrofit: capacities, opportunities and motivations. The desire of RMI practitioners to meet customer expectations could be used to develop pragmatic building performance evaluation, guided by householder satisfaction criteria. Originality/value The study examined the attitudes and experiences of an under-researched sector who are essential to the delivery of improved building performance.

Although the number of solar homes has experienced rapid growth in Europe and Italy, literature investigating the impact of PV power plants on home values is still very limited. This paper aims to fill this gap. We implement a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) approach to estimate individuals' WTP for different typologies of domestic PV plants, which vary in technical characteristics. Our findings show that homebuyers are willing to pay a price premium for solar homes, ranging from some 3% to some 15%, depending on PV panels' characteristics.

Such optimisation requires a household-centric energy management system as opposed to a one-rule-fits all approach. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-layer digital twin of the energy system that aims to mirror households' actual energy consumption in the form of a household digital twin (HDT). When linked to the energy production digital twin (EDT), HDT empowers the household-centric energy optimisation model to achieve the desired efficiency in energy use. The model intends to improve the efficiency of energy production by flattening the daily energy demand levels. This is done by collaboratively reorganising the energy consumption patterns of residential homes to avoid peak demands whilst accommodating the resident needs and reducing their energy costs. Indeed, our system incorporates the first HDT model to gauge the impact of various modifications on the household energy bill and, subsequently, on energy production. The proposed energy system is applied to a real-world IoT dataset that spans over two years and covers seventeen households. Our conducted experiments show that the model effectively flattened the collective energy demand by 20.9% on synthetic data and 20.4% on a real dataset.

It also seeks to identify the incentives and barriers for sustainable developments perceived by real estate professionals. Design/methodology/approach The paper investigates the impact of sustainability features on the valuation of buildings in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The study uses a qualitative structured questionnaire to determine the views of certified real estate valuers and advisors on this subject. Findings The results suggest a green premium of at least 1% in the UAE, coming from both supply-side and demand-side, and in commercial and residential sectors. Key barriers for the recognition of green building value include availability of reliable market data, lack of relevant technical skills and apparent client disinterest. Initiatives that would encourage green buildings include financial incentives for key stakeholders, raising and enforcing building standards, and higher energy prices. This paper identifies policy measures that local authorities may consider in transforming to a more sustainable economy. It is expected that such changes would convey to the real estate industry and affiliated stakeholders the financial benefits to be gained from investing in green buildings. Research limitations/implications The UAE is not a transparent environment in terms of building prices and rents, and it can be challenging even for experienced professionals to determine whether an observed higher value can truly be considered a green premium. The second issue is that the results may be affected by a ""voluntary response bias"", whereby recipients who are interested in sustainability are more likely to have responded to the survey.

The wide application of occupant energy interventions, such as providing subsidies to promote energy saving, involves continuous financial investments, which has been a particular challenge to subsidy providers, i.e. national energy agencies. Exploring the cost-effective interventions is essential in the case of promoting household energy conservation in the long term. In this study, a promising strategy to lighten the financial burden of energy policy providers - Household Energy Saving Option (HESO) is proposed and validated. HESO is an option-based strategy that offers buyers (i.e. households) an opportunity to earn the reward, depending on whether they can achieve the pre-determined energy saving goal. A conceptual framework of HESO is established, which consists of five elements, namely theoretical foundation (T), integrated interventions (I), market premises (M), energy sustainability (E), and stakeholders (S). To test the effectiveness of HESO on household energy reduction, a preliminary experiment was conducted in 101 households living in Singapore and the results demonstrated that HESO has a positive effect on encouraging home electricity conservation based on the Difference-in-Difference (DID) analysis. Compared to the baseline of household energy consumption, HESO-induced energy reduction was 8.18% and 12.56% when saving goals were set at 5% and 10%, respectively. Possible reasons to explain different effects of HESO on energy reduction have been elaborated, including the effect of positive feedback and re-adjustment of households' energy saving motivation during the transition period. Key determinants of HESO's success have also been discussed, such as management of cash-flow liquidity and design of goal difficulty. HESO shifts costs from energy policy providers to the households who fail to achieve their goals, which significantly improves the cost-efficiency of residential energy reduction strategies. This study contributes to the literature by developing a framework of option-based residential energy saving intervention. The results enlighten a promising and scalable solution by using a marketized intervention for promoting effective energy conservation in households while minimizing the cost burden borne by the city government.

This paper examines the path planning algorithms for UAVs through a literature survey conducted on 139 systematically retrieved articles published in the last decade that are narrowed down to 36 highly relevant articles. As retrieved from the shortlisted articles, the path planning algorithms include RRT, Artificial Potential, Voronoi, D-Star, A-Star, Dijkstra, MILP, Neural Network, Ant Colony Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimization that are classified into four main types: Model-based, Conventional, Learning-based, and Cell-based. Most of the disaster-related articles are focused on the post-disaster phase only and use conventional and learning-based algorithms with applications to localize victims and optimize paths. Regarding the UAV communication network (UAVCN), the key challenges are communication issues, resource allocation, UAV deployment, defining UAV trajectory, and content security. UAV path planning's key barriers are path optimization, path completeness, optimality, efficiency, and achieving robustness.

Appealing to behavioral economics and finance theory, we test for a connection between changes in tenant and property management behavior and electricity consumption. Through a partnership with a global institutional investment manager, this study examines ten years of asset-level operating statement and electricity consumption data in Canadian and U.S. office buildings, measuring both the initial impact of such interventions as well as any adjustments observed over time. Analysis of the proprietary intervention data allows us to better understand the impact of varied environmental interventions on the electricity consumption of commercial real estate. We find that all four intervention categories, including building certification, are associated with decreased electricity consumption, with tenant engagement providing an immediate decrease that is maintained over time. Environmentally-focused capex is also associated with decreased electricity consumption in both Canada and the U.S. Taken together the results indicate that utility consumption and its associated costs are only minimized when multiple environmental interventions are implemented.

Lately, the adoption of the European Green Deal (EGD) has further fueled interest in the topic. The building industry is expected to step forward towards decarbonization, as well as to mobilize towards a clean and circular economy, so supporting the pursuit of climate neutrality. In this position paper, we aim to discuss three major issues at stake, which are crucial to increase the renovation rate of the building stock and, hence, to the success of the EGD. The first key issue is whether a cost premium has to be expected due to retrofit projects. The second key issue is whether or not the large swing currently experienced in the price premium for building energy efficiency undermines stakeholders' confidence. The third key issue is whether we need tailored evaluation methodologies for energy-efficient building portfolios.",2021,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,226-240,,,12954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000728364800017,,,,,,,,,"Gervasi, O; Murgante, B; Misra, S; Garau, C; Blecic, I; Taniar, D; Apduhan, BO; Rocha, AMAC; Tarantino, E; Torre, CM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS, ICCSA 2021, PT VI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of building codes can primarily be classified into three scenarios: (1) An industry standard that reduces transaction costs; (2) An isolated quality standard; or (3) A quality standard with spillover effects. To holistically evaluate the impact of a particular building regulation, we propose three major guidelines: (1) Correct market failures; (2) Estimate market impacts; and (3) Account for distributional considerations. This framework is applied to energy efficiency regulations and solar panels in particular. Energy efficiency codes reduce negative environmental externalities and information asymmetry and promote high-quality long-term affordable housing stock; however, the willingness to pay for energy efficiency varies with income.

Of notable significance is the rising cost of housing relative to household income - a measure often referred to as the housing cost-burden. Its subsequent effect on affordable and accessible housing is experienced on a national level, yet perceptions often place rural communities among the most vulnerable. The proceeding research seeks to challenge this notion and further analyze what rural residents, specifically rural renters, face in managing their housing costs. For instance, utilities are an often overlooked contribution to the severity of the overall burden. Their presence as fixed, unadjusted, housing costs lie in aggregate of more direct expenditures. While utilities may lack immediacy, they are pervasive in their prolonged impact. Therefore, it is a combination of factors that make sub-populations of rural areas more susceptible to housing cost externalities.

On the other hand, it gives rise to an issue resembling the ""lemons"" problem in New Institutional Economics, as sellers such as developers and owners of properties with poorer ratings do not disclose, or only partially disclose this information to the public. Given that a likely result of this ""lemons"" problem is lower average market prices that drive good products out of the market, this paper, thus, investigates this latent issue by assessing how the knowledge of these ""lemons"", referring to BEAM Plus-assessed buildings with an ""Unclassified"" rating, influences the price effect of BEAM Plus certification for other certified properties. Utilizing Bayesian Modeling, the findings indicate that should the ""green lemons"", or BEAM Plus-assessed properties with an Unclassified rating, be known, the price premium for other BEAM Plus-certified properties on Hong Kong Island and in the New Territories is higher than the scenario under which ""green lemons"" are not known as thus mistaken as non-assessed properties. This finding is akin to the traditional ""lemons"" issue which can result in the saturation of ""lemons"" in the market due to lower average prices that drive the good quality products out of it. This situation, we believe, is further exacerbated by the HKSAR government's GFA Concession Policy that grants GFA concessions to projects assessed under BEAM Plus regardless of rating, which is reflected by the high percentage of assessed projects with an ""unclassified"" rating. A higher degree of disclosure for these ""lemons"" compared to what is required now, according to the findings, could benefit potential investors and the BEAM Society alike. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The results obtained in both 2015 and 2017 confirm that practitioners' perspectives seem to limit the amount and/or type of information they pass on to their clients. Clients are not considering sustainability features as they may not be aware on the existence of such information and are not informed by practitioners about the value of such information.

A set of four artificial neural networks (NNs) is created to provide a fast and reliable estimate of the energy consumption in buildings due to heating, hot water, cooling and electricity, depending on some specific buildings' characteristics, such as geometry, orientation, climate or technologies. Design/methodology/approach The assessment of the building's energy demand is performed comparing the as-is status (pre-retrofit) against the design option (post-retrofit). The authors associate with the retrofit investment the energy saved per year, and the net monetary saving obtained over the whole cost after a predetermined timeframe. The authors used a NN approach, which is able to forecast the buildings' energy demand due to heating, hot water, cooling and electricity, both in the as-is and in the design stages. The design stage is the result of a multiple attribute optimization process. Findings The approach here developed offers the opportunity to manage energy retrofit interventions on wide property portfolios, where it is necessary to handle simultaneously a large number of buildings without it being technically feasible to achieve a very detailed level of analysis for every property of a large portfolio. Originality/value Among the major accomplishments of this research, there is the creation of a methodology that is not excessively data demanding: the collection of data for building energy simulations is, in fact, extremely time-consuming and expensive, and this NN model may help in overcoming this problem. Another important result achieved in this study is the flexibility of the model developed. The case study the authors analysed was referred to one specific stock, but the results obtained have a more widespread importance because it ends up being only a matter of input-data entering, while the model is perfectly exportable in other contexts.",30/11/2020,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,357-385,,3,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000568342400001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides, low economic power and awareness make it difficult to invest in energy upgrades in rural areas. Therefore, low-cost energy retrofit strategies are required to reduce energy levels and improve occupants living conditions while minimizing adverse environmental effects. This study aims to define optimum retrofit strategies for rural buildings based on their economic viability, environmental impact, and comfort benefits in the form of a multi-criteria decision support tool for retrofit projects in four represented climates of Iran. Three groups of retrofit strategies (architectural, constructional, and renewable) are modelled in four actual rural buildings in different climates. Environmental, economic, and comfort performance of each strategy is calculated via different indices by dynamic simulations. Energy consumption, carbon emission and cost (ECC) analysis are carried out. Different active and passive retrofit measures are evaluated via ECC. The main result of this study is a multi-criteria decision making tool for prioritizing retrofitting strategies in rural houses in different climates. According to results, the primary energy demand is reduced between 46 and 55%, the carbon emission is reduced between 40 and 51%, and thermal comfort levels are improved up to 23% in different climate zones. In line with the current market prices of Iran (high construction costs and low energy prices due to energy subsidies), the payback time for retrofit actions is not very appealing for the building owners. Thus, subsidizing should be dedicated to refurbishment strategies instead of energy. Also, widespread governmental supported programs should be administrated to educate and improve awareness, especially in low-income areas.",2020-07,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000540224400003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average green productivity rises from 0.701 in 2015 to 0.849 in 2018, indicating that the energy utilization rate of enterprises has gradually increased. From the calculation and decomposition of the Malmquist total factor productivity index, we know that technological progress is vital in improving the green productivity of real estate companies. (2) As for the influencing factors, the green productivity is positively related to factors such as policy compliance indicator P, environmental responsibility commitment indicator R, indicator of green innovation capability I, and indicator of green development information disclosure M.

However, previous studies have reported mixed findings on the effectiveness of this system. This study is undertaken in Japan to assess whether energy labels are effective and validate the significance of the label design. We use an online survey to determine the effects of energy labels on target consumers. We choose two energy label designs: one with a stairs rating form design and the second with a rating scale of the energy efficiency. Adopting a within-subjects method, each respondent shown both designs and asked to evaluate the energy-saving level based on the labels. Cross-tabulation confirms the positive effects of labeling on energy-savings levels, which are amplified by increasing the level of the reference point. The highest insulation performance level in Japan complies with a law enacted back in 1993; the results show that greater effects can be realized by increasing the level of the reference point. A logistic regression analysis shows that energy labels with the stairs rating have a negative influence, while labels with a rating scale are preferred based on ease of understanding by the respondents. This suggests that energy labels that offer a rating scale can contribute to facilitating energy savings, although there are problems with the comprehension of the gradation colors which need to be further examined.

I review the vast yet piecemeal research that has been carried out since. Focusing on energy efficiency in buildings, I organize the review around the concept of credence good: just like that of auto repairs or taxi rides, the quality of energy-efficiency measures is never fully revealed to the buyer; as a result, it is subject tomultiple information asymmetries. My first contribution is to distinguish symmetric-information problems from information asymmetries. The former arise when information is either incomplete or imperfect, but equally shared by contracting parties; as non-market failures, these can be addressed by technological progress and insurance markets. My second contribution is to give structure to the information asymmetries associated with energy efficiency by disentangling screening, signalling, moral hazard and price discrimination within a variety of contractual relationships involving buyers and sellers, owners and renters, borrowers and lenders, and regulators and policy stakeholders. I find evidence of information asymmetries to be compelling in utility-included rental contracts, unclear in home sales and rentals, and scarce in retrofit contracting and financing. I conclude by discussing the intricacies between informational and behavioural problems in energy-efficiency decisions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Weatherization retrofits, such as air sealing and insulation, lower residential energy consumption, resulting in reduced fuel and electricity-related emissions, improved ambient air quality, and avoided climate and health impacts. However, retrofits without adequate ventilation may worsen indoor air quality (IAQ) and lead to adverse health effects and costs that offset anticipated economic benefits. Building energy management and climate action plans often omit these potential consequences. This study presents a novel framework that quantifies health and energy costs and benefits related to residential energy-efficient retrofits. Energy savings from reduced consumption were estimated using historical energy prices. Reductions in ambient emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) precursors were translated to avoided health impacts using health damage functions. Indoor PM2.5-related health impacts were estimated by applying PM2.5 concentration-response functions to changes in IAQ. Health impacts were monetized using health impact assessment techniques and compared to retrofit-related savings. For a modeled gas-heated midrise multifamily building in Boston, MA, weatherization retrofits without ventilation or filtration retrofits led to household health costs that far exceeded energy savings and population-level health savings, given increases in indoor PM2.5 concentrations (3.1 mu g/m(3) and 20.4 mu g/m(3) for standard and high-performance retrofits, respectively). In contrast, weatherization coupled with ventilation and filtration retrofits resulted in large savings.

Most residential multi-apartment buildings in the Russian Federation were built before mid-1990s with low energy efficiency and, often, low quality. The situation is aggravated by the lack of timely repair, which adversely affects the performance of these buildings. The sphere of individual housing construction also lacks of quality control at all stages of the life cycle of a building. Builders ignore important features of the building design, or the construction works are carried out by unqualified workers, without sufficient quality control. This results in increased energy consumption during the operation of the building, compromised microclimate in the house, violation of environmental requirements, and, in the absence of timely repairs, loss of the bearing capacity of the structural elements of the building. Important areas of development in the field of housing construction are to energy efficiency, improvement of the system of operation and maintenance of buildings, transparency in the operational performance of buildings for owners and investors. To obtain such benefits, it is necessary to develop a strategy for implementation of intelligent technologies and smart engineering systems to improve energy efficiency, automate operational processes and create an 'intelligent' profile of a building.

Using the opinion of qualified real estate agents, this paper explores whether, in Spain, EPC labels play any role in housing marketing, as well as the policy changes required to foster efficient dwellings. The results reveal a large misunderstanding of the EPC labels, since they are seen as a global home-quality indicator, while their impact on residential marketing is quite poor. Apparently, both supply and demand place a small interest in energy performance, although it is slightly larger for sellers/buyers in relation to lenders/tenants. In any case, EPC labels are far from blurring the energy information asymmetry, since most of the buyers/tenants are informed of the EPC rating after having selected their home. Overall, the EPC scheme has a poor reputation exacerbated by inaccuracies, unintelligible units to express the financial and environmental implications of energy efficiency, and an apparent weak supervision.

Although house buyers and renters often recognize these certificates, they often do not use them. One explanation for this is lack of trust in these certificates. This paper presents the results of an online survey (n = 354), in which the role of perceived source credibility, trust in the certificate and people's involvement in energy efficiency was studied on renters' attitudes towards EPCs in Ireland, so-called BER labels. The results showed that trust is a key determinant for attitudes to EPCs, i.e., attitudes to EPCs become more positive when people trust them. However, how trust is used for the formation of attitudes depends on cognitive involvement (i.e., referring to information processing activities and the achievement of idealization states) and affective involvement (referring to feelings and achievements of certain emotional states). These two types of involvement moderate the effect of trust on attitudes to EPCs in different ways: high-cognitive involvement amplifies the effect of trust on attitudes, whereas high-affective involvement suppresses the effect of trust on attitudes. This has important theoretical implications, as both are often measured together. Equally important are the policy implications: we conclude that if trust levels are relatively high, policies focusing on increasing cognitive involvement are more likely to be effective, whereas if trust in EPCs is low, policy strategies should aim to enhance affective involvement.",2020-01,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000504057300020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence of the exclusion of a certain number of users in collective housing units from the central heating supply system in the city of Skopje, the problem of heating cost allocation and collection of the fixed part of the heat energy payment has arosen. The subject of the analysis in this study was the heat transfer in buildings, with the main focus on the issue of heat transfer rate between residential units with different internal temperatures, such as from heated to unheated or partly heated apartments in collective building objects. The purpose of the analysis was to assess the mutual energy interaction between the completely or partially excluded apartments from the central heating system and the adjacent apartments connected to the central heating system. This is done by simulating the thermal characteristics of typical buildings that are representatives of new (insulated) and old (un-insulated) buildings. For the simulation purposes, the external average daily and monthly temperatures were obtained based on the perennial outdoor temperatures measured in Skopje and additional series of input data that are characteristic for the city were used. For the value of the internal temperature in the dwellings the value for the standard internal design temperatures are predefined. As results of the simulation, values were obtained for the annual heat gains (in kWh/year) and the specific heat gains (in kWh/m(2)year) of the excluded apartments from the system of central heating through the enclosures (internal walls, ceiling and floor) of the adjacent apartments that are connected to the system for central heating and vertical hot water pipelines for an isolated and nonisolated buildings. In order to obtain a clearer picture, in the study are considered different configurations and positions of apartments in the building. As an indicator for each considered apartment, the ratio of the received thermal energy of the disconnected apartment to the required energy for its heating is calculated. Based on the obtained results, appropriate conclusions were drawn regarding the reduction of the necessary energy for heating of the excluded apartments, as a consequence of the thermal gains through the walls of the neighboring apartments that are connected to the heating system.",2020,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000538681000025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,SUSTAINABILITY IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION (SBE19),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There exists a wide range in spatial and temporal parameter space in an ensemble of non-linear dynamic systems, each executing a control task, while the global objective is to drive the overall system to an optimum operating condition i e minimum total operational power at desired rack inlet temperatures. Certainly, it is beneficial in optimizing workload migration at temporal scales but, solving the instability of the cooling systems operating at design points helps in understanding the whole system and make predictions to have better control strategies. Several techniques are available to realistically capture and make predictions. Data driven modelling/Machine learning is one such method that is less expensive in terms of cost and time compared to other methods like validated CFD simulation/experimental setup. The objective of this study is to develop a control framework based on predictions made using machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to operate multiple Computer Room Air Conditioning Units (CRAC) or simply Air-Cooling Units (ACU) in a hot-aisle contained raised floor datacenter. This paper focuses on the methodology of gathering training datasets from numerous CFD simulations (Scenarios) to train the ANN model and make predictions with minimal error. Each rack has a percentage of influence (zones) based on the placement of ACUs and their airflow behavior. These zones are mapped using steady state CFD simulation considering maximum CPU utilization and cooling provisioning. Using this map, ITE racks are targeted and given varying workload to force the corresponding ACU that is responsible for provisioning, to operate at set points. Number of such scenarios are simulated using the same CFD model with fixed bounds and constraints. Using large samples of data collected from CFD results, the ANN is trained to predict values that correspond to the activation of the desired ACU. Such efficient control network would minimize excessive cooling. The validated prediction points are used to model a control framework for the cooling system to quickly reach the operating point. These models can be used in real-time data centers provided; the training data is based on in-house sensor values.",2020,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,334-340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000701365300046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NINETEENTH INTERSOCIETY CONFERENCE ON THERMAL AND THERMOMECHANICAL PHENOMENA IN ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS (ITHERM 2020),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some architects design shared landscapes on and around large-scale buildings which are excludable to the public, like private gardens, but can be rivalrous between residents, like parks. This potentially mitigates public vegetation and subsequent ecosystem service loss. However, little evidence exists on whether condominium unit buyers pay more for shared landscapes. To address this knowledge gap, we used the hedonic pricing method to explain condominium unit resale value with unbuilt and vegetated space, accounting for other price determinants, spatial and temporal random effects using a robust regression. Leaf area above 184 m(2) and unbuilt area (condominium estate area minus the building footprint) above 62.3 m(2) per person had significant positive effects on condominium unit selling price. This provides evidence that economic returns can be gained by having vegetation in accessible landscapes on and around buildings, should they be provided above a certain quantity. When supplied at more abundant quantities condominium estate vegetation also had a bigger effect than nearby managed parks, suggesting condominium unit buyers see more economic value in having nearer snore private vegetation.

The metamodels predict the degree -hours of discomfort by heat and/or by cold as a function of design parameters for three Brazilian cities: Curitiba, Sao Paulo, and Manaus. The key design parameters, related with passive design strategies, are building orientation, shading devices position and dimensions, thermal properties of the walls and roof, window-to-wall ratio, and effective window ventilation area. The method consists of three main stages: (i) baseline model development; (ii) Monte Carlo simulation; (iii) multivariate regression. Overall, the metamodels showed R-2 values higher than 0.95 for all climates, except the ones predicting discomfort by heat for Curitiba (R-2 =0.61) and Sao Paulo (R-2 =0.75). The proposed metamodels can quickly and accurately assess the thermal performance of naturally ventilated low-cost houses.

Previous studies on the effect of EPCs on property value have yielded divergent results, with some studies finding that energy labels affect property values, but others finding that energy labels have little or no effect. The present paper takes the analysis one step further. Using data on energy prices in combination with transaction data from Oslo, we conclude that not only the energy label, but also the energy performance of dwellings in general, has little to no effect on transaction prices. This result is in line with the inferences of several survey studies, which indicate that when people buy a dwelling, they pay considerably less attention to its energy performance compared with other factors, such as the location, neighborhood, size, garden, and the number of bedrooms.",2019-09,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,18,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000489101200159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While India has set an aggressive goal of extending the grid to all households by 2019, grid extension does not necessarily imply reliable electricity access. Indian utilities face a financial disincentive to supplying reliable electricity in rural areas because of subsidized tariffs and low consumer willingness-to-pay. Tariff subsidies for full household electrification in these states would be about Rs 15,000 Cr per year, which is two-times the existing subsidies and equivalent to 20-30% of their annual utility revenues. We find that superefficient lamps, TVs, and fans can reduce the energy consumption of a rural household by over 70% cost-effectively, resulting in a net reduction in the total subsidy burden. Reduced consumption offers an opportunity to raise consumer tariffs while ensuring consumers' monthly electricity bills reduced. We also argue that superefficient appliances make consumer-side storage cost-effective, leading to greater consumer willingness-to-pay. We recommend adoption of super-efficient appliances as part of the electricity access initiative in India, and electricity service based tariff setting as the next policy steps towards providing a reliable and sustainable electricity access.",2019-09,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,1163-1175,,,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000483425800109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the evaluation of the sustainability of building solutions, however, the embodied energy to produce a building and finally to dispose of it at the end of its lifecycle are also important. The energy used for the disposal of a building and the processing of the residues are also important for the overall energy balance since the handling of natural resources is increasingly the centre point of thought and action. A research team at the Chair of Structural Design of TU Dresden has thus been working since 2012 on demountable solutions in masonry, which can be dismantled at the end of a building lifetime and sorted for recycling, which fully complies with the requirement for the reduction of rubbish and waste products. The high precision of block production today permits us to omit the levelling effect of mortar and to build dry buildings in the future, i.e. to do without the bonding principle. The associated strength reductions can be suffered without problems. The appropriate basics of such a dry building method have been researched in a collaboration between the ILEK in Stuttgart and the Xella Technologie- und Forschungsgesellschaft mbH in Emstal. In this research project with the abbreviation ""REMOMAB"", the basics of an energy-efficient dry building method suitable for recycling were collected and made available for practical application. In a follow-up project, these basics are being implemented and tested on an experimental building. Cost aspects are also to be taken into account and if possible, construction solutions available on the market will be used - modified if necessary. Another aim is for the first time to dismantle such a building and to rebuild it at another location. This is intended to demonstrate that a reuse is possible after dismantling and such a building method can react to changing demands in the housing market.",2019-08,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,265-275,,4,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000480786200007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relative significance analysis of the data led to the identification of 13 CSFs. Furthermore, agreement analysis revealed that there is no good agreement between respondents from the academic sector and those from the industrial sector on the ranking of the 13 CSFs. Moreover, through factor analysis, the CSFs were grouped into four underlying components: developer's enabling CSFs; household-demand enabling CSFs; mixed land use CSFs; land use planning CSFs.

With this understanding recommendations for alleviating energy poverty experienced by students living in the private rented sector can be formulated. The research conducted is based on qualitative methods; focus group discussions and interviews. Data were collected from almost 30 student landlords in seven EU countries between October 2017 and January 2018. Findings show that grants and financial incentives are key for the questioned proprietors to move to energy efficiency improvements of their property but bureaucracy burdens are a major barrier for moving forward with them. In addition, the need for stronger information campaigns on energy efficiency issues is revealed.

Yet, data limitations have hindered reliable estimations. Filling this gap, this study uses a large panel dataset on energy consumption for commercial buildings in Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona. By tracking building occupants' monthly energy consumption before and after the building's certification as an Energy Star building, we provide new estimates of the environmental gains from private investment in green real estate. Results show that for occupants that occupy space in a certified building in both the pre-certification and post-certification periods, occupants in Energy Star buildings consume 8% less energy. This empirically robust estimate of potential benefit from green-certification provides a quantifiable benchmark against which green-promoting policies can be measured. We also document evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects. Energy savings differ by the building's initial certification points and the building's baseline energy consumption. These results are useful for policy makers to identify targets for green certification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The period from 1990 to 2015 is covered, however divided in two parts, 1990-2005 when conditions were not favourable for renewable energy because the price of fossil fuels and policy support for renewable energy were low, and 2005-2015 when these conditions improved.Theoretical analyses show that the high price of fossil fuels, policy support and cost-effective technologies can explain the fast growth of modern renewable energy during 2005-2015; however, they only partially account for its slower growth during 1990-2005. An additional explanation might be that the innovators generate qualities due to renewable energy use, which are expressed on the markets as value addition of energy services. The statistical analysis of energy services during 1990-2005 shows that the European Union (EU) led in renewable energy compared to the United States (US), Japan and other countries, which was driven by the social initiatives that fostered new firms in the electricity and gas business. A statistical analysis of energy services in the US and EU during 2005-2015 reveals that their value added has grown on an annual average of 2.0% and 2.8%, respectively, which denotes an annual increase of 3 billion and 6 billion US dollars in the 2005 value (USD2005). This valorisation of energy services has invoked further innovations in distributed energy systems and energy storage. A further statistical analysis of the 14 largest countries by population confirms a valorisation of energy services due to modern renewable energy where the emission reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a side-effect. Extrapolation of the averagegrowth rates from the period 1990 to 2015 to the period 2015 to 2040, without any change but a substitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy, demonstrates that global income would grow fourfold and energy consumption twofold along with a 100 times larger modern renewable energy and CO2 reduction to 46% of the 2015 level. When those average growth rates of renewable energy decrease linear to 25%in 2040, the global modern renewable energy grows tenfold and CO2 reduces to 82% of the 2015 level.The implication of this statistical study on large countries shows that higher value energy services for households are often based on distributed renewable energy and that such an addition of value generates a CO2 emission reduction as a side effect which can be enhanced by pricing CO2 or obstructed by policy support for the vested interests. This study indicated that the valorisation of energy services will generate a growth of income, energy consumption and renewable energy along with a far-reaching emission reduction of CO2 if policies do foster sustainable innovations.",20/03/2019,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000462310700001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to assess the preliminary risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification benefits of data centre Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the USA, Australia and Singapore. The strategic implications going forward for data centres as an innovative property sector in the property investment space are also highlighted. Design/methodology/approach - Using monthly total returns, the average annual return, annual risk, risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification benefits of data centre REITs in the USA, Australia and Singapore over 2016-2018 are assessed. Optimal asset allocation analysis is performed to investigate the value-added role of data centre REITs in a mixed-asset portfolio. Findings - Data centre REITs delivered strong average annual return performance, outperforming the composite REITs in all three markets. This also sees data centre REITs being riskier than the overall REIT sector due to the non-traditional and maturing status of the data centre property sector. On a risk-adjusted basis, competitive performance was recorded for data centre REITs, with data centre REITs in the USA and Singapore outperforming their respective composite REITs. This performance is also delivered with significant portfolio diversification benefits with the stock market, resulting in data centre REITs contributing to the US mixed-asset portfolios across a diverse risk spectrum. Practical implications - Institutional investors are now giving increased emphasis to alternative property sectors with better risk-return trade-offs. Improved performance and diversification benefits are achieved by supplementing existing property portfolios with non-traditional property sectors with counter-cyclical risk-return profiles, one of which is the data centre property sector. This sees data centres as an important alternative property sector, having technology-based drivers and being recognised as having a clear path towards institutionalisation with the major investors in the near future. Originality/value - This paper is the first published empirical research analysis that specifically assessed the preliminary performance and diversification benefits of data centre REITs in the USA, Australia and Singapore. This research enables empirically validated, more informed and practical property investment decision making by institutional investors regarding the future strategic role of the data centre property sector as an innovative sector in the institutional property investment space.",04/03/2019,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,140-152,,2,37,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000459748000002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such implications for space users are of great importance, as tenant businesses may be unwilling or unable to pay a rental rate premium for environmentally-certified space if there is not an associated user benefit. Under a simple yet rigorous fixed effects model with geographic clustering, we study the relationship between environmentally-certified retail space and location specific financial performance. Examining retail bank branches, we find that LEED certified spaces are associated with above average deposit levels, while Energy Star-certified branches offer inconsistent results. These results are tested in an event study which validates the findings, and indicates that the benefits of LEED extend years past initial certification, evidencing lasting income-related benefits. Finally, bank- and branch-specific subsample analyses confirm these results while controlling for idiosyncratic characteristics.

However, whether these policies have been effective in reducing the total residential consumption of energy is still unclear. In this paper, we analyze the impact of residential energy efficiency policies on household energy consumption across Europe for the period 1980-2016. We examine the electricity and non-electricity energy consumption separately, as these are generally used for different purposes (appliances and heating) by households and are subject to different energy efficiency policies. We focus on two distinct types of regulations mandatory energy efficiency labels for household appliances and building standards. After controlling for county-specific effects and changes in income, energy prices, demography and climate conditions over our sample period, our results offer compelling evidence that both the energy labeling requirements for appliances and the stricter building codes lead up to lower residential energy consumption. According to our estimation results, we should expect a 0.24% reduction in residential electricity use after governments introduce a mandatory disclosure of energy labels for an appliance group that represent ten percent of households' electricity use. Similarly, given that U-values proxy the thermal quality of the new dwellings, we find that a 0.1 unit decrease in the U-value requirement triggers a lasting 0.28% annual decrease in residential non-electricity energy consumption. These results can help policymakers to shape future regulations targeted on reducing our energy use in the years to come. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this paper is to test for such a bias in Poland's case using a small open economy, CGE model called GEMPOL, with an in-house split of energy sectors. Three alternative versions of the model are calibrated and solved. The first version includes energy sectors in their original breakdown. The second version includes their in-house split, with particular values of Armington elasticities derived directly from ""parent"" sectors. In the third version, Armington elasticities are increased in order to reflect the higher degree of international competition for smaller sub-products. Through a simulation shock, imposed under comparative-statics mode, an exogenous energy efficiency improvement is modelled. Finally, the results obtained from all the variants of the model are compared. It turns out that the simulation results produced by both aggregations and all three specifications of the model are similar from the macroeconomic perspective, but they vary significantly between different aggregations at the sectoral level.",2019,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,Sep-45,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000462012100002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Swedish real estate sector has often been identified with its ambitious public housing program during the record years (1960-1974). This was at the time the largest housing program per capita in the world where more than a million apartments were built in a nation with a population of 8 million. These apartments once being the pride of a nation, are facing a lot of problems today, ranging from vacancy and unacceptable physical condition to very poor energy performance. These buildings at the verge of their service/economic life are in need of extensive maintenance and renovation measures. Considering the technological development today, the problem with maintenance and renovation remains to be the financial constraints. These are what makes planning for maintenance and renovation complicated and cost inefficient. Although there are tools that can help property managers with maintenance and renovation planning, they all fail to address the complexity of the decision-making process in a multi-objective criteria under financial and time constraints. In this study, the focus is on the life cycle economy of the building components subject to energy performance improvements during renovation. A systematic approach has been proposed that can be used to budget and plan renovation with regard to energy efficiency under budget constraints. This approach utilizes a modified condition/deterioration model of the method Schroeder to simulate the maintenance effect on the condition state of building components in order to obtain the cost-optimal maintenance regime under given restrictions. This methodology can be used to compare the cost effectiveness of different energy-renovation scenarios and determine the optimal renovation plan for a single or a combination of buildings with regard to owners' objectives and existing constraints.

The aim of this paper is to research quality of measures to combat energy poverty. The implemented methodology included an analysis of measures to combat energy poverty in European countries and analysis and quality of Croatian measures to combat energy poverty. The combat energy poverty can only be carried out with high quality measures while bad measures send the wrong image to customers. While access to energy is one of the ways to combat poverty, high energy price affects a lot of people who cannot pay for it. Furthermore, incentive measures aimed at developing renewable energy sources and energy efficiency requirements increase the energy price. High-income households can invest in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, but low-income households cannot replace the appliances with high energy consumption with those that have lower consumption. Hence, their energy consumption (that is higher than the average) has a significant impact on their economic status and social inclusion. The first research on poverty in the Republic of Croatia was carried out by the World Bank and the Croatian Central Bureau of Statistics in 1998, when 4% very poor households were detected. Newer research resulted with a higher percentage of those who are not able to ensure adequate heating in the coldest months.

To fully capture the meaning of cold homes, an empirical dataset of thermal efficiency of individual dwellings and actual heating in a residential area in Seoul, South Korea is examined along with the tenure type and the ownership attributes. The analyses reveal that the amount of actual heating energy consumption did not show any clear relation with the thermal efficiency of housing or the tenure type. Additionally, considerably inefficient dwellings like old, detached houses are occupied by elderly owners who often lack both the financial capability and intention to properly maintain their properties. The result indicates that people who are living in cold homes are not always confined to poor residents living in rented homes. The study proposes some new types of potential fuel poverty based on the analyses of thermal efficiency and heating patterns by dwellings.",2019-01,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,202-214,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000454343000020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, recent years have seen a strong increase in the uptake of solar technologies in the building sector. In this work, the potential of a solar combined heat and power (CHP) system based on an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) engine is investigated in a domestic setting. Unlike previous studies that focus on the optimisation of the ORC subsystem, this study performs a complete system optimisation considering both the design parameters of the solar collector array and the ORC engine simultaneously. Firstly, we present thermodynamic models of different collectors, including flat-plate and evacuated-tube designs, coupled to a non-recuperative sub-critical ORC architecture that delivers power and hot water by using thermal energy rejected from the engine. Optimisation of the complete system is first conducted, aimed at identifying operating conditions for which the power output is maximised. Then, hourly dynamic simulations of the optimised system configurations are performed to complete the system sizing. Results are presented of: (i) dynamic 3-D simulations of the solar collectors together with a thermal energy storage tank, and (ii) of an optimisation analysis to identify the most suitable working fluids for the ORC engine, in which the configuration and operational constraints of the collector array are considered. The best performing working fluids (R245fa and R1233zd) are then chosen for a whole-system annual simulation in a southern European climate. The system configuration combining an evacuated-tube collector array and an ORC engine is found to be best-suited for electricity prioritisation, delivering an electrical output of 3,605 kWh/year from a 60 m(2) collector array. In addition, the system supplies 13,175 kWh/year in the form of domestic hot water, which is equivalent to more than 6 times the average annual household demand. A brief cost analysis and comparison with photovoltaic (PV) systems is also performed, where despite the lower PV investment cost per kWel, the levelised energy costs of the different systems are found to be similar if the economic value of the thermal output is taken into account. Finally, a discussion of the modelled solar-CHP systems results shows how these could be used for real applications and extended to other locations.",15/10/2018,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,755-765,,,228,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000447479400061,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the project focuses on the unprecedented integration of different technologies to achieve a multi-benefit approach that is provided by a closer integration between energy and non-energy related benefits. The project aims to combine different pre-fabricated elements in a unified and integrated system resulting in a higher performance in terms of energy requirements, structural safety, and social sustainability. The project attempts to achieve this goal through the introduction of innovative solutions for building envelopes to optimally combine the climatic, structural, and functional aspects through a significant architectural transformation and a substantial increase of the real estate value of the buildings.

These houses, now in need of major renovation, are represented in this study by two reference buildings. The results show that Passive House renovations can be cost-effective, but this largely depends on the type of heat generation used in the houses. The most cost-effective individual renovation measure was installing an exhaust air heat pump, and the least cost-effective was installing new windows. In houses using direct electric heating, the Passive House renovation package was the most cost-effective alternative. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Subsequently, the most well-known indicators deployed in policy-making, the established 10% indicator and the recent Low Income High Cost (LIHC) indicator, have generated considerable discussion and critique. One facet of the debate that remains unexplored is the effect of a change in indicator upon the spatial distribution of fuel poverty. Using spatial analyses we interrogate sub-regional estimates of the two indicators in England, where the LIHC indicator was first conceived. Three principle findings are discussed, enhancing understanding of the geographic features of fuel poverty as understood by each indicator. Firstly, the reduction in fuel poor households has disproportionately affected areas with lower housing costs. Secondly, there is a higher prevalence of fuel poverty in urban areas. Finally, the condition is more spatially heterogeneous with fewer 'hot-spots' and 'cold-spots'. As a result, each indicator captures different notions of what it means to be fuel poor, representing particular vulnerabilities, losses of wellbeing and injustices. This has implications for the targeting of limited alleviation resources and for alternative national contexts where the LIHC indicator might be deployed.",2018-02,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,79-93,,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000427790500010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent studies on the economic viability of ""going green"", including cost-benefit analyses from the perspective of building life cycle and from the perspective of major market participants. While ""going green"" is more likely to be seen as profitable from the building life cycle perspective, economic viability, from the perspective of developers and occupants, remains unclear due to information, behavior and policy factors. Such discrepancy in the results regarding economic viability is one major reason for the ""paradox"" of the very gradual diffusion of apparently cost-effective green buildings in most economies. We also propose several key topics that merit future research, including more comprehensive evidence about life-cycle costs and benefits of green buildings, the incorporation of ancillary long-term or intangible benefits in the analysis of economic viability for developers and occupants, an investigation on the dynamics of the adoption of green buildings, and institutional arrangements for stimulating green practices in the building sector.

It is estimated that there is a shortage of around one million dwellings, which is equal to one-fourth of the total housing stock in the country. As a part of the solutions, the country needs architectural designs that satisfy three main conditions: enable an increase of the housing production, be affordable and satisfy people's residential requirements. The latter includes, for instance, providing suitable layouts, comfortable environment and the required level of privacy. Within this spectrum, this paper focuses on providing a thermally comfortable indoor environment. The importance of this aspect is raised by the high temperatures in Iraq, the unreliable electricity supply, reducing the running costs and the need to maintain the environment at comfort conditions. The paper explores the courtyard pattern as an approach to achieve a thermally comfortable indoor environment, and studies how courtyards might be adopted within multistory residential buildings in order to reduce the costs and support the housing production. It reports on an extensive literature review that investigates published scientific studies within the last ten years about the thermal efficiency of the courtyard pattern and its design features. To propose design solutions, the paper considered the investigation's results and the main residential buildings criteria and standards.

High share of fossil fuels used for space heating leads to high pollution emission. A solution for this problem may be encouraging customers to use electricity as an energy carrier for space heating, by proposing appropriate tariffs. Diverse electricity tariffs for households are described, differing in energy prices and distribution rates in certain periods of a day. Demand price elasticity is calculated by comparing energy increases in zones using standard load profiles of customers settled according to the flat tariff and the time of use tariff. The values of demand price elasticity are then used to create customers' load profiles based on price changes within newly proposed tariffs. A forecast of the consumption rise resulting from the new implemented anti-smog tariff motivating consumers to use electricity during the low load period in the Polish power system is presented.",2018,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000482771100140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE EUROPEAN ENERGY MARKET (EEM),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such schemes are expected to stimulate rational energy consumption by the end customers, provide peak shaving and overall energy efficiency. But under dynamic pricing planning a household's energy consumption becomes complicated. So automated planning of household appliances is a promising feature for developing smart home environments. Such a planning should adapt to individual user's habits and preferences over comfort to cost balance. We propose a novel approach based on learning customer preferences expressed by a utility function. In the paper an algorithm based on inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework is used to infer the user's hidden utility. We compare IRL-based approach to multiple state-of-the art machine learning techniques and the proposed earlier parametric Bayesian learning algorithm. The training and test datasets are generated by the simulated user's behavior with different price volatility settings. The goal of the algorithms is to predict a user's behavior based on the existing history. The IRL and Bayesian approaches showed similar performance and both of them outperforms modern machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, random forest etc. In particular, the preference learning algorithms significantly better generalize to data generated with parameters different from the training sample.

In Mount Lebanon, the traditional house is a cultural asset built of native stone one-meter thick double-wythe walls. Today, lack of public policies is causing those environmental assets to approach extinction. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology uses multivariate regression on 128 data points. A mathematical model is developed and empirically tested on public attitudes toward restoration. Independent variables represent the need for protectionist policies, X1; contribution of restoration to environmental sustainability, X2; contribution to culture, X3; and financial benefits, X4. Findings - It is found that stone houses transfer heat significantly slower thanmodern construction. There is a statistically significant and positive correlation with X1, X2, and X3, but negative with X4, most likely due to favoring return on investment of multistory buildings over the attractiveness of stone houses. Research limitations/implications - As future research implications, the undergirding of urban planning policies need to be revisited. Current policies neither protect heritage, nor offer legal means to restore heritage houses. Practical implications - Practical implications include revisions to building laws in Mount Lebanon, as they marginalize old stone structures. Environmental valuation techniques, use value and existence value, are recommended. Social implications - Social awareness needs to be built about valuation techniques to account for complex assets that cannot be approximated through short-term real estate market price. Social rather than financial cost-benefit analysis must be performed to quantify environmental assets. Originality/value - This research illustrates a pilot restoration project with critical issues faced by heritage stone houses.

The empirical analysis illustrates that it is neither the mass character of such housing, nor its high-rise nature that creates the problems and negative image often associated with housing estates elsewhere in the world. Rather, we outline seven challenges faced by such estates: ageing of their structure and resident population, networked connectivity, energy efficiency, densification, urban planning that favours real estate agents, neglect of housing policies and housing rights, and condominium governance. The housing estates and their problems are so much a part of everyday normality in Bucharest that the local administration tends to take them for granted and has not placed them on the public agenda despite the inevitability of their structural decay at some time in the future.

The introduction of the practice of design of the gas supply system with household stabilizers of pressure requires developments of scientific methods of calculation and design. Results. The annual saving of fuel gas due to the pressure stabilization according to experimental research of the authors is 2-3 %.

This growing transistor count, coupled with recent architecture and compiler advances, has resulted in an unprecedented exponential performance increase of computers. With the end of Dennard scaling, however, the power required to operate all transistors at the full performance level simultaneously grows across the technology generations. Consequently, chips will keep an increasing fraction of transistors power gated or dark to remain within the power envelope. The power-gated part of the chip, known as dark silicon, is expected to comprise a significant portion of the die real estate in new technology generations. In addition to power limitations, the limited and nonscalable off-chip bandwidth is the second source of dark silicon. The key challenge to improving performance in the dark silicon era, consequently, is how to efficiently leverage transistors when they cannot all be powered at the same time. Core specialization shows promise in addressing this challenge by improving the performance and energy efficiency of applications. This method leverages the dark silicon to build many diverse power-efficient accelerators and each application only activates a subset of cores that best match its processing requirements. In this chapter, we propose a network-on-chip specialization method that leverages dark routers of a partially active many-core chip to customize the topology for active cores, effectively reducing the power consumption and latency of communication.",2018,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,217-258,,,110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000453682700007,,,DOI: 10.1016/bs.adcom.2018.03.009,,,,,,"Hurson, AR; SarbaziAzad, H",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to Bogota's climate conditions at 8500 ft. of altitude and non-adapted materials to local conditions, the temperature of these state-subsidized dwellings is usually below optimum comfort standards. This research analyses the impact on temperatures using certain types of materials, comparing the effect of some traditional building skins-composed by brick and concrete - with a new wall envelope made of recycled elements. A comparative study was carried out by housing typologies, based on a work of measurement of the temperatures inside 16 individual dwellings. Thermal simulations were made to compare the traditional brick envelope material vs a compacted plastic brick, and the results suggest that the construction of dwellings with traditional materials such as brick blocks and prefabricated concrete blocks may not provide the best conditions of thermal comfort. However, alternative materials made of recycled plastic can represent a cheaper, ecological and comfortable solution.

We look at the rise in air pollution over recent decades, and the perhaps surprising finding that in many of China's urban areas, levels of particulates (of less than 10 microns) have been decreasing during the last 10 to 15 years. We then turn to the costs and tradeoffs of air pollution, including costs to human health, reductions in worker productivity, and how people are seeking to reduce their exposure to pollution as shown by compensating differentials in real estate prices and purchases of masks and air filters. We discuss how rising incomes tend to raise the demand for environmental amenities and thus increase political pressure for environmental protection, and then we turn to the policy tools that China has used to reduce pollution. We conclude by arguing that as China's government is preparing for an additional 300 million people to move to urban areas over the next 30 years, it will have a number of opportunities for China to reduce pollution through a shift from manufacturing to services, along with various steps to improve energy efficiency and resource conservation.

A Stated Preference Analysis in Barcelona,BUILDINGS,,2075-5309,10.3390/buildings7020053,,"Energy performance in buildings has become a milestone in EU environmental policy in the last 15 years. Nonetheless, in some countries such as Spain the full acceptance of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is still relatively rare and novel, with little evidence as to how relevant it is in the real estate market. There are different reasons for this phenomenon: on the one hand, the real estate crisis has paralyzed the completion of most of the works in new/refurbished efficient buildings (which renders it impossible to use revealed preference methods); on the other hand, information is not complete and the consumer's perception of the relevant cost/benefits could be incorrect. For this reason, assessing the trade- off between the energy label and other specific attributes of the housing market has become important. To that end, a choice experiment following an RPL (Random Parameter Logit) model was employed. This form is suitable to accommodate various empirical situations where the assumptions of the Conditional Logit model have to be relaxed. Results suggest that the Energy Label (EL) does matter in the real estate market in relation to other residential attributes. Marginal willingness to pay for an ""A"" label instead of an ""E"" is significantly higher than the stated savings in energy costs.

On closer inspection, this is not the only paradox affecting the research branch that focuses on the energy used by the buildings and the building industry. A second paradox is that investments in energy efficient solutions may contribute to energy price control, which in turn lends itself to make the same investments not profitable. A third paradox lies in the need to adopt energy-intensive materials in order to achieve substantial energy savings in operation; hence, sometimes, we just substitute a certain amount of operating energy with a more or less commensurate amount of embodied energy.

Matching on observables proves to be important in some cases, reducing the estimated impacts compared with models without matching.

There is a clear interest in providing affordable housing, yet sustainable and environmental issues are highly marginalized. To bridge this gap, and to meet Jordanian housing needs while tackling environmental problems, this research has analyzed the environmental issues of selected housing projects in Jordan, aiming to determine the existing problems. In addition, it proposes a solution through a sustainable and affordable housing model that was analyzed and compared to the previously studied housing projects. Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional design strategy was adopted and a mixed design method was used. Information related to the physical and operation characteristics of buildings was collected through the review of ""as built"" drawings and other relevant documents. Further information was obtained from field surveys and personal interviews with architects and decision-makers in the housing sector. Energy consumption patterns of these housing projects were analyzed using the DesignBuilder simulation program. Water efficiency was assessed using the BRE Code Water Calculator. Based on the previous analysis, a new housing model was developed that was evaluated in terms of energy and water consumption. Findings - The analysis shows a significant difference among different housing projects in terms of energy cooling and heating loads in different climatic regions in Jordan. Energy analysis proved that the proposed model is energy efficient in different locations and it can save up to 50.4 per cent of annual energy usage in comparison with existing projects. In addition, it can save around 43 per cent of water consumption by using a number of modifications for saving water.

A CAMA approach to modelling residential energy in housing in Northern Ireland,JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN REAL ESTATE RESEARCH,,1753-9269,10.1108/JERER-06-2016-0023,,"Purpose - Buildings contribute significantly to CO2 production. They are also subject to considerable taxation based on value. Analysis shows that while similar attributes contribute to both value and CO2 production, there is only a loose relationship between the two. If we wish to use taxation to affect policy change ( drive energy efficiency behaviour), we are unlikely to achieve this using only the current tax base (value), or by increasing the tax take off this current tax base (unlike extra taxation of cigarettes to discourage smoking, for example). Taxation of buildings on the basis of energy efficiency is hampered by the lack of current evidence of performance. This paper aims to model the now-obligatory (at sale or letting) energy performance certificate (EPC) data to derive an acceptable appraisal model (marked to market, being the EPC scores) and deploys this to the entire population of properties. This provides an alternative tax base with which to model the effects of a tax base switch to energy efficiency and to understand the tax incidence effects of such a policy. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a multiplicative hedonic approach to model energy efficiency utilising EPC holding properties in a UK jurisdiction [Northern Ireland (NI)] as the sample. This model is then used to estimate discrete energy assessments for each property in the wider population, using attributes held in the domestic rating (property tax) database for NI (700,000+ properties). This produces a robust estimate of the EPC for every property in its current condition and its cost-effective improved condition. This energy assessment based tax base is further used to estimate a new millage rate and property tax bill (green property tax) which is compared against the existing property tax based on value to allow tax incidence changes to be analysed. Findings - The findings show that such a policy would significantly redistribute the tax burden and would have a variety of expected and some unexpected effects. The results indicate that while assessing the energy performance of houses can be a complex process involving many parameters, much of the explanatory power can be achieved via a relatively small number of input variables, often already held by property tax jurisdictions. This offers the opportunity for useful housing stock modelling - such as the savings possible from power switching. The research also identifies that whilst urban areas display the expected ""heat island"" effect in terms of energy consumption, urban properties are on average more efficient than suburban/rural properties. This facilitates spatial targeting of policy messages and initiatives. Research limitations/implications - Analogous with other studies, data deficiencies introduce the risk of omitted variable bias. Modelling of the energy efficiency in the sample is limited to property attributes that are available for the wider population of properties. While this limits the modelling exercise, it is a perennial issue facing mass appraisal worldwide (where knowledge of the transacted sample attributes generally exceeds knowledge of the unsold properties). That said, the research demonstrates the benefits of sharing data and improving knowledge of the housing stock, as taxation databases would be stronger, augmented with EPC-derived property attributes for example. Originality/value - The EPC lead in time for wide residential coverage is likely to be considerable. The paper contributes to emerging literature and policy debate surrounding the effect, performance measurement and implementation of energy efficiency certification, through a greater understanding of the sectorial and geographical dispersion of energy efficiency. It provides high level research to help guide policy and decision-making, identifying key locales where there is more of a physical problem and locations where there is more to gain in terms of targeting energy improvement and/or encouraging behavioural change. The paper also allows a glimpse of the implications of a change towards a taxation regime based on energy efficiency, which contributes to the debate surrounding the ""greening"" of property based taxes.",2017,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,124-148,,2,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000407443100003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that heat energy savings and home energy efficiency theoretically and optimistically predicted by the renovation project after three years of operation of renovated houses were not reached. It was concluded after a thorough analysis that the external enclosing construction insulation reached predicted energy savings. Energy efficiency of the heat supply system was low, thermal energy consumption was higher than expected. Central heating systems are hydraulically unstable because heat in apartments is regulated emotionally, exceeding the regulated operating mode. The domestic hot water supply systems low energy efficiency causes relatively large thermal energy losses in hot water distribution and in circulation pipelines. The project was implemented in 2014; after three heating seasons of operation data monitoring, fixation of project deficiency and correction of solutions were carried out.

To deal with the problems of urbanization such as population explosion, high level of pollution, traffic chaos, huge scarcity of houses, inadequate water supply, heaps of garbage, poor infrastructure, security concerns, unemployment, overpowering political set up, etc. the concept of inclusive Smart cities, evolved in the European Union and has now spread across the continents. Thus a new approach to take on the colossal challenges of this century has emerged. It is expected that the Smart Cities will address public issues, employing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based solutions, on the basis of municipality driven multi-stakeholder partnership. The need to strengthen or extend citizens' participation in initiatives by Municipalities and emphasize establishment of more refined and accessible governance structure has been realized. While the concept of Smart Cities is still under development and evolution, it has caught on across the globe and has spearheaded a new approach to look at urban development and management. Cities have their own requirements and peculiar limitations necessitating public centric strategies, appropriate and economically viable technology and funding mechanisms. Cities accommodate nearly 31% of India's current population and contribute 63% of GDP. Urban areas are expected to house 40% of India's population and contribute 75% of India's GDP by 2030. Indian Government would earmarkUSD1054 million to fund the development of a hundred Smart Cities with a view to address various problems arising out of an accentuated rate of population influx. The Mission will have duration of five years (FY2015-16 to FY2019-20). The city level Pre-takeoff Plans in respect of quite a few cities are stimulating investment by engaging identified stakeholders i. e. ICT businesses, real estate developers, infrastructure providers, retail business and transport operators to support Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects and actions. The objective of Indian Smart City initiatives is to increase the resilience of the city. It is proposed to develop the 100 Smart Cities as Satellite Towns of larger cities by modernizing existing mid-sized cities. The aim is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of ` Smart' Solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model which will act like a light house to other aspiring cities. The new initiative of the Government of India to make cities capable of facing the 21st century challenges with the generous reliance on the latest frontiers of technologies available, serious efforts towards capacity building of the personnel manning the projects and above all employing methods to make them financially sustainable with little aid will go a long way in creating a Resurgent Urban India. The importance of deploying advanced technologies for solving the problems of city governance with ease cannot be undermined. But at the same time while embracing newer and smarter technologies to offer ease of doing business, care should be taken to make available services to the lowest denominator of the society too, in a way he/she is comfortable with.",2017,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,215-242,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000416707300010,,,,,,,,,"Ligthart, LP; Prasad, R",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many metropolitan areas have seen tremendous real estate development in recent years, yet the roads, water mains, sewers, and power grids have seen no, or extremely limited, upgrades. Whatever infrastructure is in place is aging and, unfortunately, may experience temporary use rationing as upgrades are made, as often one reads in the local press and/or experiences personally. It is clear that technological solutions are needed to manage the increasingly-scarce infrastructure resources under the limitations imposed by population growth, limited financial resources, and, in many instances, local political inertia.

The project aims at demonstrating to the key stakeholders and fmancial investors the attractiveness of a new renovation strategy based on volumetric Add-ons and Renewable energy sources (AdoRES) intended as one (or a set of) Assistant Building unit(s) like aside or facade additions, rooftop extensions or even an entire new building construction that ""adopt"" the existing buildings (the Assisted Buildings) to achieve nearly zero energy. The creation of these AdoRES aims at reducing the initial investment allocated for the deep renovation of the existing building creating an up-grading synergy between old and new. The ABRA strategy can thus result in the implementation of a punctual densification policy that aims at fostering the investments in deep renovation of the existing built environment, driving process innovation in the construction and the real estate sector. The paper, after outlining the main aspect of the project, focuses on a case study in Italian context, where different technological solutions and related economic impact are analysed: from a deep renovation to AdoRES strategies and different scenarios of renovation.

The Trust EPC South project, funded by Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, aims to scale up investments in EE solutions in the private tertiary sector in South Europe, by delivering a robust investment standardization and benchmarking framework and a pipeline of bankable EPC projects in 6 countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Croatia and Greece); its results will eventually be extended to the Balkan. Tailored capacity building activities will allow an easier access to third-party financing, thus unlocking the large tertiary sector EE and Renewable Energy market potential. Initially, national market analyses took place (EPC providers, beneficiaries-clients, and financial institutions) to identify the market potential. National Discussion Platforms were set up to develop the national roadmaps addressing mechanisms for mitigation of policy, legal, and especially financial barriers. An investment standardization and benchmarking framework, built upon an established real estate assessment tool (Green Rating T), is actually setting up in order to build trust amongst all parts of the EPC value chain.

The residential sector in Ireland accounts for approximately 25% of primary energy demand with roughly half of primary home heating fuelled by oil and 11% by solid fuels. Displacing oil and solid fuel usage with air source heat pump (ASHP) technology could offer household cost savings, reductions in emissions, and reduced health impacts. An economic analysis estimates that 60% of homes using oil, have the potential to deliver savings in the region of 600 per annum when considering both running and annualised capital costs. Scenario analysis estimates that a grant of 2400 could increase the potential market uptake of oil users by up to 17% points, whilst a higher oil price, similar to 2013, could further increase uptake from heating oil users by 24% points. Under a combined oil-price and grant scenario, CO2 emissions reduce by over 4 million tonnes per annum and residential PM2.5 and NOx emissions from oil and peat reduce close to zero. Corresponding health and environmental benefits are estimated in the region of 100m per annum. Sensitivity analyses are presented assessing the impact of alternate discount rates and technology performance. This research confirms the potential for ASHP technology and identifies and informs policy design considerations with regard to oil price trends, access to capital, targeting of grants, and addressing transactions costs.

We argue that dwellings, in particularly rental properties, are not only consumer goods, but also constitute financial market assets. Properties are spatially fixed and traded in regional contexts, where real estate market characteristics like vacancy, income levels, and expectations determine rent and prices, which in turn provide incentives to invest in housing quality. The level of housing quality (e.g. windows, building materials, or heating technology) in turn influences the level of energy consumption. While this view is established in the real estate and urban economics literature, it has only recently found its way into the energy debate. As a result, the relationship between regional housing market fundamentals and energy consumption has received little attention. This study provides a first attempt to address this paucity. Utilizing aggregate data on regional space-heating energy consumption from over 300,000 apartment buildings in 97 German planning regions, the study applies structural equation modeling to estimate the influence of housing market fundamentals on the level housing quality, and subsequently on regional energy consumption. Findings provide first evidence that regional differences in housing market conditions have a significant impact on housing quality and energy consumption. Specifically, the results suggest that carbon abatement programs in buildings should focus on regions with weak housing market fundamentals, as market incentives are unlikely to incentivize investors to invest in housing quality attributes.

This methodology allows improving the decision management in residential energy retrofitting by identifying the most effective solutions according to the requirements and needs of each intervening agent (citizens, public administrations and private promoters). The methodology is based on the integrated analysis of environmental, economic and social variables. It is applied to a Mediterranean case study from Southern Spain built in 1955. As part of methodology, survey data from the different stakeholders were collected, identifying the keys that condition the viability of the measures. The results show that measures with few inconveniences to tenants, investment costs below 2000(sic)/dwelling and payback periods below 15 years are the most viable by end-users' implementation in the Mediterranean area, but between them, only efficient heat pumps allow achieving more than 45% of CO2 emissions reduction (with a payback period of 6 years).

By using micro-level data collected from 1450 households in 27 provinces in the first ever China Residential Energy Consumption Survey in 2012, this study estimates the effects of three DSM measures empirically: tiered household electricity pricing, China Energy Label program, and information feedback mechanisms. We find these measures have contributed to moderating residential electricity demand growth but additional policy reform and tools are needed to increase their effectiveness and impact. Residential electricity demand is found to be price- and income- inelastic and tiered pricing alone may not be as effective in electricity conservation. The statistically significant relationship between China Energy Label efficient refrigerators - but not televisions - and lowered residential electricity consumption reflect mixed program effectiveness. Lastly, of the information feedback currently available through electricity bills, payment frequency and meters, only meter reader is estimated to be statistically significant. Important policy implications and recommendations for improving each of these three DSM measures to expand their impact on reducing residential electricity consumption are identified.

It focuses on transaction costs borne by building owners and building developers in the planning and implementation phases of a passive house-oriented renovation in Sweden. Results reveal three main sources of transaction costs: due diligence, negotiations and monitoring. The analysis shows that transaction costs are non-negligible and for individual cost sources the scale can be three times higher than for conventional renovations. To reduce transaction costs, various learning strategies such as study visits, demonstration projects, new forms of meetings and new channels of (written) information were found. These strategies have the potential to half transaction costs of future renovation projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, reducing the rate of air leakage (i.e. improving air 'tightness') can have a positive effect in terms of decreasing space heating requirements. This study presents an investigation of the effectiveness of airtightness measures applied in a retrofit context to a UK dwelling. A phased programme of refurbishment work was undertaken to a test dwelling at the University of Nottingham campus, UK. Evaluation techniques, including building energy modelling (SAP 2009), air pressurisation tests and thermal imaging, were performed. The study demonstrates that the use of conventional draught-proofing measures can achieve a reduction in air permeability of over 30% when compared with the house base case value of 15.57 m(3)/(h.m(2)) @ 50 Pa. This reduction was only achievable with close attention to installation detail. Further measures of service penetration and floor sealing enabled the air permeability to be reduced to as low as 4.74 m(3)/(h m(2)) @ 50 Pa. Modelling of the test dwelling predicted an initial space heating supply energy requirement of 32,373 kWh, which was reduced to 23,197 kWh by a combination of the air tightness measures, insulation, and system (boiler and ventilation) improvements. Air tightness measures alone contributed to approximately 9% of the predicted total reduction, half of which was due to relatively straight-forward draught-proofing. Other more advanced air tightness measures were considerably more expensive, though cheaper approaches to their application could help reduce payback times. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Directive 2013/55/EU introduces a common framework for training (CTF) which provides automatic recognition on the basis of accepted minimum common set of knowledge, skills and competencies required to perform a certain profession. The directive promotes the ECTS system (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation system) and introduces the possibility of expressing the duration of program in ECTS credits within the program as defined in Directive 2005/36/EC which acquired qualifier necessary for dealing a regulated profession. The introduction of the European Professional Card is one of the major achievements of the Directive 2013/55/EU. It was created to provide a system of recognition of professional experience and to promote automatic recognition of this experience across the EU as the response for different obstacles to the core principles of the Single Market for services that traditionally exist within the territory of different member states. In 2015 the European Commission adopted the implementing regulation to introduce the European Professional Card for the first five professions: general care nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, real estate agents and mountain guides who were selected among those having expressed an interest, following thorough consultations with stakeholders and Member States. Authors in the paper analyze the current situation within the European Union Single Market for services and possibilities for professionals to go cross border with no obstacles including the analysis of the European Court of Justice judgments as an important source of the EU law. The result of this analysis will give the answer on actual value of the European Professional Card for the business practi",2016,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,603-610,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000395726900078,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"SGEM 2016, BK 2: POLITICAL SCIENCES, LAW, FINANCE, ECONOMICS AND TOURISM CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, VOL II",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the European Union, office buildings have become subject to more stringent energy efficiency regulation for new construction or extensive refurbishment, with the aim to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. The study determines the influence of physical building characteristics and occupant behaviour on energy consumption, and in particular, the role of refurbishment in different intensities on energy consumption is investigated. The data-set of the Green Rating Alliance is tested to provide evidence, by applying multiple regression models for energy consumption. The results highlight considerably increased energy consumption of single-tenant compared to multi-tenant office buildings. Very large office buildings consume significantly more energy per square metre that their smaller peers. A building's modelled water consumption turns out to be a good indicator for the actual energy consumption, emphasising the importance of assessing further sustainability measures. Overall, buildings of higher age turn out to be of lower energy consumption, pointing to additional appliances and equipment in more recent buildings, to provide better services and more comfort. In general, extensive refurbishment measures account for significant higher energy use, since the overall quality of the buildings is improved with additional appliances and equipment. Testing for the interaction effect between building age and refurbishment, the results demonstrate significantly lower additional energy consumption for buildings with more recent extensive refurbishment, compared to those with refurbishment several years ago.

The idea that a rating system based on indicators and a sustainability score can guarantee architectural quality, reliability, energy efficiency, economic convenience and finally a sustainability label, produces an increased value of the building on the real estate market giving an ""aura"" of advanced product to the building itself. It is well known that different rating systems can give a different sustainability score because similar areas of evaluation in different rating systems are not equal in term of indicators' weight. Moreover, the continuous updating of the rating systems tries to include in the assessment procedures a tailored vision coming from field experience. The building rating systems were born in the last 15 years (i. e. 1998-2004), while rating systems for urban districts are more recent (2009-2012). The paper provides a survey on the more influential and worldwide diffused rating systems, highlighting the differences in terms of organization and relationship between evaluation areas and comparing existing rating schemes with recent EU research projects and initiatives such as the ""Common European framework for Sustainable Building Assessment"" (CESBA) framework. The paper aims to report the preliminary analysis on the similarities and differences among rating systems, towards a harmonization of sustainability practices to be applied to new and existing buildings.

Here, eleven construction companies that build low-energy buildings comparable in performance with passive houses have been interviewed. One conclusion is that there is not one specific barrier that keeps energy-efficient housing from taking off. Instead, the barriers include a whole range of issues that have to be considered. Internal pressure has been a strong contributor to the onset of passive house constructions within the companies and the results indicate that personal commitment is central and perhaps the strongest driver. A general reflection from the interviews is that there is a need to show both construction companies and potential customers that it is possible to build passive houses and that they exist. Unlike the national building regulations, which are not considered to be relevant when it comes to energy consumption, the future building regulations from the European Union are identified as a regulatory driver. Moreover, life-cycle thinking is reported to increase among actors, but that it would be beneficial if banks as well as real estate agents could develop a comprehensive view and become better at considering energy and LCC in their capital budgeting templates. Even if the interest for passive houses is considered low among the public, the market is identified as promising among the construction companies recently actually large enough to become a driver in itself.

Although the energy certificate is intended to provide the characteristics of individual buildings, so stimulating the real estate market toward ever better energy performance, data management of the certificates issued over time, using a national or regional energy cadastre, makes available a data base which is useful for energy planning in the building sector. This paper provides the needed results of a benchmarking study on data from the energy cadastre of the Lombardy Region, northern Italy. By integrating data from the energy cadastre (175.778 energy certificates) with the statistical data obtained from the national census, indicators were obtained on the energy performance of existing buildings. The energy indicators obtained, characterised by building type and construction period, normalised as a function of Degree-Days, become an effective tool for energy planning at local and regional scales. In the specific case, the energy indicators have been used to estimate the potential for energy retrofit of existing buildings in the Lombardy Region. The same indicators can also be used by municipalities for energy planning at the municipal or district level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this objective, a new residential energy scheduling algorithm is developed for energy management, based on action dependent heuristic dynamic programming. The algorithm works under the circumstance of residential real-time pricing and two adjacent housing units with energy inter-exchange, which can reduce the overall cost and enhance renewable energy efficiency after long-term operation. It is designed to obtain the optimal control policy to manage the directions and amounts of electricity energy flux. The algorithm's architecture is mainly constructed based on neural networks, denoting the learned characteristics in the linkage of layers. To get close to real situations, many constraints such as maximum charging/discharging power of batteries are taken into account. The absent energy penalty cost is developed for the first time as a part of the performance index function. When the environment changes, the residential energy scheduling algorithm gains new features and keeps adapting in real-time operations. Simulation results show that the developed algorithm is beneficial to energy conversation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, it is frequently argued that private investment and the quality of thermal upgrades are too low in the light of the challenges faced and the potential energy cost savings. While many authors address the potential barriers for investors to increase energy efficiency, studies on the capabilities of different investors to reduce energy requirements of their property are scarce. This study investigates potential advantages of housing company's size, i.e. economies of scale, economies of scope and institutional learning in thermal upgrades of residential housing. Based on unique data on energy consumption in 102,307 apartment buildings in Germany, we present new evidence for the advantages and disadvantages of a housing company's size in ""green"" retrofitting projects. Our estimations show, that large housing companies outperform private landlords by far in high effort refurbishment projects. In contrast, private landlords appear to have advantages in low effort, incremental refurbishment activities. We demonstrate that a substantial share of the advantages of larger firms can be associated with specialization (i.e. repeated projects). The results offer new options for policy makers to refine the support schemes toward a low carbon housing stock. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, interventions on buildings constructed before 1945 (commonly defined as ""historic buildings"") mean a higher benefit/cost ratio, because, in many cases, green retrofitting can be linked to unavoidable refurbishment works and renovated buildings can take on an interesting market value. However, an important part of these historic buildings in Italy is composed of cultural heritage buildings; these buildings require a specific design approach, and green retrofitting is often not attractive from an economic point of view.

The households can combine their primary heating source with secondary heating e.g. a woodstove. This choice results in increased indoor air pollution with fine particles causing health effects. We integrate health cost due to use of woodstoves into household optimisation of heating expenditures. The results show that due to a combination of low costs of primary fuel and low environmental performance of woodstoves today, included health costs lead to decreased use of secondary heating. Overall the interdependence of heat generation technology- and heat saving-choice is significant.

Design/methodology/approach - The tool consists of a system dynamic model that allows describing and quantifying the complex interaction between potential maintenance scenarios, external energy factors and case-specific conditions. In addition, to include the uncertainty of some of the input variables related to the external energy factors, Monte Carlo simulation has been applied. Findings - A case study of a city hall in The Netherlands showed the usability of the proposed tool. Over the selected period of 20 years, applying the chosen set of interventions, the simulation showed possible gains in the net present value and significant decrease of energy consumption and carbon emission. Municipal officials and consultants verified the tool for energy efficiency. Research limitations/implications - Although the tool has proved its functionality in one case study, to test its robustness, additional case studies would be preferable. Practical implications - The assessment tool can help organizations in assessing energy-efficient maintenance scenarios that include multiple technical energy efficiency interventions as a part of other maintenance activities. Originality/value - There are numerous ways to increase building's energy efficiency, but a lack of knowledge is often hindering the enhancement of maximal benefits. A tool that would assess both financial and environmental benefits of potential technical intervention would provide useful insights into corporate's real estate current and possible future energy performance.

On the other side, the current legislation on environmental sustainability in construction gives clear guidelines in energetic improvement object regarding the entire real estate assets, including historic buildings. The paper aims to define a technical-economic model for the selection of technologically advanced interventions useful to improve the buildings energy performance of historical and architectural interest. This can happens by respecting the needs and regulations on the protection of the valued property. The software implementation for the energy characterization of the historic building and the use of cost-benefit analysis, allow to drawing up an analysis protocol to support investment decisions. The issues research about the low thermal and acoustic insulation of the building envelopment and inefficient plants leads to outline intervention strategies and corresponding technical solutions, listed in detail in the article. The research appears important on the theoretic side because rationalizes the various phases necessary for the selection of the energetic requalification interventions, for which the cash flows analysis is essential to ensure the financial sustainability of the initiative.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors analyze a dataset of office building valuations from 2009 to 2011, provided by the German Investment Property Database. The authors use hedonic regression models to determine the effect of energy efficiency and energy consumption on Market Values. Using generalized additive models (GAM) for modeling nonlinear covariate effects, the authors control for further building characteristics and location. Due to the small sample size, the authors introduce an innovative econometric approach that mitigates this problem. Findings - Mainly due to the small sample size, and in spite of the newly developed econometric methodology, the authors do not find clear evidence of the relationship between energy efficiency and the Market Value. However, the study nonetheless provides interesting insights into the composition of office building Market Values in Germany. Originality/value - In addition to the empirical results for the German office market, the main contribution of this paper lies in the econometric methodology.

How would you go about tracking and verifying such reductions? Further, how would this be accomplished in a city without a database of building-specific characteristics and no energy reporting law? To begin, let's consider what this task would look like for one building. Where to start? Let's try with a performance metric and point of comparison. Just as cars gauge performance by MPG, and pitchers by ERA, buildings can use Energy Use Intensity (EUI) as a performance metric. Measured in Energy / ft(2) / year, EUI standardizes energy use per square foot, allowing for comparison between many buildings. EUI is a snapshot of building performance over one year's time. It is relatively easy to calculate a building's EUI if their energy usage is known, but in order to gauge performance over a longer period, a constant comparison point must be established so that evaluation is consistent. Called the baseline, this comparison point can be established as a past year, a future goal, or the average performance of similar buildings. This paper covers the work of the Pittsburgh 2030 District team in formulating an energy performance baseline for each building in Downtown Pittsburgh for purposes of tracking energy use reduction towards the 50% reduction goals of The 2030 Challenge. Pittsburgh is a city with a large stock of aging buildings, without mandatory benchmarking laws, and no single publicly accessible real estate profile by property. Thus, the energy baseline methods included in this paper summarize efforts to create such an aggregated property characteristic database and associated energy baseline for Downtown Pittsburgh; it is the hope of the authors that these efforts will assist similar cities in mirroring 2030 District goal setting and achievement for building energy",2014,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,79-104,,4,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000350418500005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It appears that these amounts could be reduced substantially, with benefits to both household budgets and the environment's well-being. This paper's goal is to evaluate the alternative mechanisms that could expedite energy efficiency retrofits for U.S. housing. We begin by evaluating the evidence that significant improvements in the energy efficiency of existing U.S. housing are feasible, both technologically and financially. We compare the relatively optimistic positions taken in McKinsey and Company (2009a,b), EPRI (2009), and Harcourt, Brown, and Carey (2011) versus the less optimistic appraisal in Allcott and Greenstone (2012). We conclude that significant energy savings do appear to be both technologically and financially feasible. The remainder of the paper considers the bottlenecks that hamper energy-saving investments for the residential sector. We focus on imperfect information and loan market failures as the two key factors. We evaluate the state of the art with respect to scoring and assessment tools for energy-saving investments and the On-Bill, PACE, and Solar programs to facilitate secured loans. The discussion concludes with a series of proposals to overcome the bottlenecks. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Mexico has started to develop and implement actions for the efficient use of energy in order to reduce its consumption. The field of building construction has been particularly active in studying ways to optimize the use of energy, especially regarding energy use indoors. One of the main goals of architectural design is to create the proper indoor conditions so individuals can carry out their daily activities in a comfortable area. Interior space must be designed and calculated to provide a comfortable temperature, appropriate lighting, sound control and ventilation for individuals to carry out their daily activities, but must also address the energy required to provide all these characteristics. In warm dry climates, air-conditioning is responsible for a significant amount of the energy consumed in buildings. Proper building design is necessary in order to reduce energy consumption in this sector. This paper shows the results of simulations with the Energy Plus software to compare the thermal performance of a low-cost housing located in a warm dry climate, Hermosillo, Sonora, with similar construction systems in the envelope. Furthermore, an analysis of the effect of the color exterior finish, represented as a gradual change in the absorptance to solar radiation. The simulation is performed for two conditions of use of low-cost housing, the first condition considers the room without air conditioning and the second considers the air conditioned room. To simulate analyzed housing with air conditioning, is used an air conditioner from the database Energy Plus, corresponding to a Mini-split system compact unit zone cooling with a COP (Coefficient of performance) of 1.83.

The Solar Decathlon is a biennial competition which challenges international collegiate teams to design, build, and operate net-zero energy solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive. Like the Olympic Decathlon, the Solar Decathlon consists of 10 contests: juried contests (engineering, architecture, market appeal, communications and affordability) and measured contests (comfort zone, hot water, appliances, home entertainment and energy balance). The purpose of the competition is both educative - educational experience for the participating students, for the general public, for the building industry and the policy makers - and research oriented - encouraging multi-disciplinary collaboration towards development of new technologies and methods. The paper discusses the educational experience of the students participating in this international competition, focusing on the engineering undergraduate students. It describes the plan implemented for integrating the Solar Decathlon into the required curricula within the engineering, architecture, and business departments. A project as large and diverse as this one required accommodating curricular development at various levels and within various modes of teaching and learning. Students were encouraged to participate in the process in five ways: design studios, research labs and seminars, special topics, construction, and monitoring. Although the greatest learning experience for the students occurred in the integrated design process - across engineering disciplines, and school of architecture - the student team members also learned how to raise funds, procure materials and construction equipment, and how to interact with one another towards a mutual goal. The project provided an opportunity for the development and implementation of new educational materials focused on energy efficiency, sustainable building design, solar energy, and power conversion and conditioning technologies. Being part of a large and varied team seeing a project from the preliminary design phase to construction and commissioning, the students were provided with a true multi-disciplinary hands-on opportunity. The opportunity proved to strengthen their technical skills, acquired in the regular curriculum, via integration of theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Moreover, the students were exposed to the perspective and educational styles of professors and students in each represented academic department (electrical and computer engineering, mechanical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, architecture, marketing and communications).

Standardized and repeated blocks of flats were massively spread throughout the country, offering identical living conditions for all their inhabitants. After the fall of the totalitarian regime, 96% of the inhabitants living in the blocks of flats became owners of their apartments, one of the highest rates of ownership in Europe. Nowadays, almost 60% of the Romanian urban population lives in these so-called grey neighborhoods. The renovation of these buildings started in the middle of the 90's, as a response to their technical degrading. Most common interventions resulted in the addition of pitched-roofs over the deteriorated flat roofs in order to prevent infiltrations. The real estate development from the 2000s treated the so-called thermal rehabilitation program into a business opportunity by using the slope roof as a livable attic connected to the existing block. As a result, new apartments were added, increasing the urban density levels, but without offering a significant improvement for the existing inhabitants. The existing Thermal rehabilitation program consists in cladding the facade with a polystyrene base thermal envelope system, and, in some cases, the replacement of the openings with efficient doors and windows. In this case the reduction in energy demands is of 30-40%. The plumbing and heating systems are not included therefore energy management systems are not present. By contrast, sustainable retrofitting embodies an integrated approach concerning social, economic and environmental aspects. The present article describes the detailed aspects of the two directions of intervening on this specific Romanian building stock. Multiplication represents an advantage for the implementing of both measures (almost 40.000 blocks of flats exist in Romania). The market viability of the two types of intervention is translated in two different industrialization processes detailed in this paper.",2014,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,605-612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000366135800078,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"GEOCONFERENCE ON NANO, BIO AND GREEN - TECHNOLOGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE, VOL II (SGEM 2014)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher price of a CFL to an incandescent bulb (IB) and limited knowledge about the life span of CFLs versus IBs are found to lower adoption rates by as much as 20%. While CFL adoption increases the technical efficiency of household lighting, the lower cost for lighting services results in estimated rebound effects that decrease potential energy savings by 23% to 35% due to increased brightness and extended hours of use. These findings have important implications for household welfare and cost-benefit tradeoffs for CFL projects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding how a commercial building uses energy has many benefits; for example, it helps building owners and tenants identify poor-performing buildings and subsystems and it enables high-performing buildings to achieve greater occupancy rates, rents, and property values. This paper estimates the possible impacts of a national energy benchmarking mandate through analysis chiefly utilizing the Georgia Tech version of the National Energy Modeling System (GT-NEMS). Correcting input discount rates results in a 4.0% reduction in projected energy consumption for seven major classes of equipment relative to the reference case forecast in 2020, rising to 8.7% in 2035. Thus, the official US energy forecasts appear to overestimate future energy consumption by underestimating investments in energy-efficient equipment. Further discount rate reductions spurred by benchmarking policies yield another 1.3-1.4% in energy savings in 2020, increasing to 2.2-2.4% in 2035. Benchmarking would increase the purchase of energy-efficient equipment, reducing energy bills, CO2 emissions, and conventional air pollution. Achieving comparable CO2 savings would require more than tripling existing US solar capacity. Our analysis suggests that nearly 90% of the energy saved by a national benchmarking policy would benefit metropolitan areas, and the policy's benefits would outweigh its costs, both to the private sector and society broadly.",2013-07,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,3,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000325247100063,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimated premium on an otherwise similar house insulated to code levels exceeds the cost of installation at construction: insulating to basic code levels at construction passes the market test. The premium instead reflects the higher cost of retro-fit installation. We suspect that price, cost, and performance risk have discouraged widespread code-level retro-fits in this market.

For each building under analysis, an energy audit and further monitoring were brought in, in order to issue an energy evaluation according to the Portuguese energy agency rules. Results showed an expected decrease of the operational costs of natural gas and electricity, obtained by the use of efficient building systems and equipment, as well as a decrease of the payback period for each situation.",2013-03,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,Jan-17,,1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000215234000001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach - The energy performance measurement and dummy variables for three categories of improvement recommendations are included as explanatory variables in a hedonic regression analysis using transaction data and energy performance certificates data for 1,073 observations. Findings - Results indicate that better energy performance effects selling prices positively. Energy efficiency recommendations seem to have an impact on sale price; home buyers seem to require a larger ""discount"" for more complex types of measures. Research limitations/implications - The sample only includes houses in the Stockholm; so-called sustainable buildings have not been specifically studied; and the heating source has not been accounted for.

They offer a great opportunity for energy savings because retail stores have many similarities, and because large companies can implement successful energy efficiency strategies across their portfolios. Recognizing this potential, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) formed the Commercial Building Partnership (CBP) program to work with select companies in retail and commercial real estate to reduce energy consumption by 30% in existing buildings and 50% in new construction versus ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 (ASHRAE 2004a). The National Renewable Energy Laboratory partnered with Target under the CBP program to design and implement a retrofit of a SuperTarget in Thornton, Colorado. The result was a retrofit design that predicted 37% energy savings over ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2004, and 29% compared to existing (pre-retrofit) store consumption. Energy simulations of each efficiency measure played a key role in determining a mix of solutions that would provide the best value and yield the highest savings. The largest savings came from energy-efficient lighting and cooling systems, improved refrigeration, and better control of plug loads. The results of this effort will be carried forward to inform the retrofit of other stores across the nation.

These systems are mature and effective within vertically integrated market segments. However, new questions are reaching across these traditional information silos. For example, buyers may be interested in evaluating the design, energy efficiency characteristics, and operational performance of a commercial building. This requires the integration of information across multiple databases held by different institutions. Today, this type of data integration is difficult to automate and propone to errors due, in part, to the lack of generally accepted building and spaces identifiers. Moving forward, the real estate industry needs a new mechanism to assign identifiers for whole buildings and interior spaces for the purpose of interoperability, data exchange, and integration. This paper describes a systematic process to identify activities occurring at building or within interior spaces to provide a foundation for exchange and interoperability.

With Directive 2002/91/EC, in the UE territory all real estate must have an energy performance certificate. This certification estimates the annual energetic needs of a building and then determines its energetic class identified by a letter from A+ to G. Here it is proposed to apply the same idea to the transport sector and urban planning. This certification will help to increase the performances of the transport system for the benefit of users and environment. Land use and city planning influence the energy consumption, so new plans should be subject to minimum energy performance measures according to local conditions. This will establish minimum levels of energy efficiency that new settlements will have to meet. The proposed methodology, if applied to existing zones will help to identify the least efficient and provides for them measures for improvement. The determination of the class will depend on the energy consumption estimated by simulations of travel throughout the vast area in which the zone under investigation is located. Then we can identify the number of O/D trips for each area of the wide, their traveled distance and mode of transportation. Once estimated, from these data, the per capita consumption for the transport of the inhabitants (of the vast), it is possible define the threshold of transition from one class to another, and then categorize all zones located within it. The proposed classification will be used to vary the costs of urbanization and the taxation of real estate according to the energy performance of the zone. In conclusion, as the class is an indicator easily understood by all, this method will bring local government and public opinion toward more efficient choices and to introduce new design standards.

The cost of sludge treatment account for a significant share of the total running costs of a WWTP. By increasing the efficiency of sludge treatment, significant savings can be achieved. Savings can be gained e.g. by more efficient energy utilisation of sludge, combined with optimised wastewater treatment processes. In addition to cost efficiency, environmental sustainability of the applied solutions is crucial. The energy balance and green house gas emissions can be used as tools to evaluate the sustainability of sludge treatment options. This paper presents a case-based comparison of energy balances, green house gas emissions and costs of municipal wastewater sludge process chains based on anaerobic digestion or incineration. Information from existing plants was used for conducting the study. Several utilisation options were covered for biogas energy as well for energy from sludge incineration. Based on the results, sludge incineration was the most expensive option of the studied scenarios, but justified if the heat generated can be fully utilised e.g. in district heating. Based on costs and energy balances as well as green house gas emissions it is most preferable in anaerobic digestion chains to feed the generated biogas to a gas engine to produce electricity and heat. Moreover, thermophilic anaerobic digestion can improve the overall economy of a WWTP provided that the biogas yield is sufficiently higher than in a mesophilic process. However increased odour is a risk in thermophilic digestion. The study showed that the most energy efficient process modifications are always very case bound.

The paper finds that household characteristics have a much stronger association with consumer awareness of labels than with the choice of Energy Star appliances. Renting the home. Hispanic ethnicity, being poor or near poor, and living in regions with lower ACEEE scores do, however, decrease the propensity for households to purchase Energy Star appliances.

The study finds no evidence of a significant relationship between environmental and/or energy performance and rental and capital values. A small subset of 24 BREEAM-rated assets is also tested for significant price effects but a statistically significant effect is only confirmed for equivalent yields. Similarly, there was no evidence that the EPC rating had any effect on Market Rent or Market Value with only minor effects of EPC ratings on equivalent yields. The preliminary conclusion is that energy labelling is not yet having the effects on Market Values and Market Rents that would be expected if high EPC ratings were associated with substantial cost savings that are fully reflected in capital values and/or were readily available and taken into account by prospective tenants and buyers.

As of September 2012, only energy-efficient lighting sources will be allowed for sale. Among these are halogen light bulbs, light-emitting diodes (LED), or compact fluorescent light bulbs-often referred to as energy-saving light bulbs. The Commission's justification for the phase-out of conventional light bulbs maintains that a reduction in the electricity consumed will not only lead to lower energy cost for private households and industrial consumers, but at the same time lead to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This article discusses possible reasons for the slow market diffusion of energy-saving light bulbs and shows that the investment in energy-efficient light bulbs does not necessarily lead to significant cost reductions. Drawing on some illustrative examples, we demonstrate that the use of cheaper incandescent bulbs instead of energy-saving light bulbs can be economically rational in cases of rather low usage times, in which the higher initial purchasing price might only pay off after very long time spans. Furthermore, due to the coexistence with the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), this regulation attains no additional emission reductions beyond those achieved by the ETS alone. We thus conclude that the general ban of incandescent light bulbs is inappropriate and should be abolished by the Commission. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

High thermal efficiency of the constructed building envelope is a key strategy in the design and construction of buildings which limit use of active space conditioning systems. Australia's current housing stock is thermally poor and national energy performance standards are relatively weak when benchmarked against international best practice. A lack of data has impeded the policy debate and a significant gap in analysis remains a lack of empirical research into the life-cycle cost implications of increased building thermal efficiency, particularly for residential buildings. This paper applies an integrated thermal modeling, life cycle costing approach to an extensive sample of dominant house designs to investigate life cycle costs in a cool temperate climate, Melbourne Victoria. Empirical analysis provides new insights into lifetime costs and environmental savings for volume housing design options and identifies sensitive factors. Results suggest that the most cost-effective building design is always more energy efficient than the current energy code requirements, for the full time-horizon considered.

Research shows that building regulations which depend mainly on building envelope requirements do not guarantee the best environmental and economical solutions. In the current study, a modified multi-objective optimization approach based on Genetic Algorithm is proposed and combined with IDA ICE (building performance simulation program). The combination is used to minimize the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)-eq) emissions and the investment cost for a two-storey house and its HVAC system. Heating/cooling energy source, heat recovery type, and six building envelope parameters are considered as design variables. The modified optimization approach performed efficiently with the three studied cases, which address different shimmer overheating levels, and a set of optimal combinations (Pareto front) was achieved for each case. It is concluded that: (1) compared with initial design, 32% less CO(2)-eq emissions and 26% lower investment cost solution could be achieved, (2) the type of heating energy source has a marked influence on the optimal solutions, (3) the influence of the external wall, roof, and floor insulation thickness as well as the window U-value on the energy consumption and thermal comfort level can be reduced into an overall building U-value, (4) to avoid much of summer overheating, dwellings which have insufficient natural ventilation measures could require less insulation than the standard (inconsistent with energy saving requirements) and/or additional cost for shading option.

Germany provides an allowance to low-income households, covering the housing as well as the space heating cost, to protect people from the consequences of poor housing conditions and fuel poverty. In order to limit public expenditures, payment recipients are required to choose low-cost dwellings, with the consequence that they probably occupy flats with a poor thermal performance. Recipients might therefore exhibit a lower per-square meter rent but in turn are likely to have a higher energy consumption and energy expenditures.

Both models can help to inform policy-makers and the public whether delivered energy in the domestic sector is on track and whether the reductions correspond with the expected impact of a more efficient domestic sector. The annual delivered energy, price, and temperature (ADEPT) model uses multiple linear regression to fit consumption data since 1970 (R(2) = 0.76). Findings indicate that with typical recent heating season temperatures of 7 degrees C and at 2005 energy prices, average household delivered energy is estimated at 21.7 MWh (95% confidence interval = 20.8, 22.6). For every 1 degrees C increase in heating season temperature, average household delivered energy drops by approximately 1 MWh/year. Energy price elasticity is estimated at -0.2, so that a 50% rise in energy prices corresponds to an approximate 10% decline in energy demand. To fit quarterly delivered energy data since 1998, a seasonal temperature energy price (STEP) model is also developed using polynomial multiple regression (R(2) > 0.99). At 2005 energy prices, the average household has a minimum power demand of 1.2 kW (including approximately 0.4 kW electricity) at about 16 degrees C, which rises as external temperatures drop to 5 degrees C, where it begins to plateau at approximately 3.8 kW. The average heat loss coefficient is estimated at 240-320 W/degrees C. Both models find no evidence to date to indicate that changes in delivered energy are beyond those expected due to variations in external temperature and energy price. The seasonal model also provides benchmarks for delivered energy as a response to external temperature and energy price that will be useful for a comparison of building performance evaluations with the national stock, without requiring data for a whole year.",2010,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,Dec-24,,1,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000276099100002,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because older housing with lead paint constitutes the main exposure source today in the US, we quantify health benefits, costs, market value benefits, energy savings, and net economic benefits of lead-safe window replacement (which includes paint stabilization and other measures). The benefit per resident child from improved lifetime earnings alone is $21,195 in pre-1940 housing and $8685 in 1940-59 housing (in 2005 dollars). Annual energy savings are $130-486 per housing unit, with or without young resident children, with an associated increase in housing market value of $5900-14,300 per housing unit, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Net benefits are $4490-5,629 for each housing unit built before 1940, and $491-1629 for each unit built from 1940-1959, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Lead-safe window replacement in all pre-1960 US housing would yield net benefits of at least $67 billion, which does not include many other benefits. These other benefits, which are shown in this paper, include avoided Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, other medical costs of childhood lead exposure, avoided special education, and reduced crime and juvenile delinquency in later life. In addition, such a window replacement effort would reduce peak demand for electricity, carbon emissions from power plants, and associated long-term costs of climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The inter-component communication overhead, along with the engineering efforts required to integrate, verify, and validate such heterogeneous systems are scaled disproportionally as the complexity of such systems continue rising skyrocketedly. Moreover, due to limited instruction encoding space and the need to maintain back-ward compatibly in the future designs, designers are often forced to include only a very small subset of the total desired functionalities on chip, despite there can be more than sufficient silicon real estate to incorporate these specialized operation units. This paper proposes a cost-effective technique of incorporating diverse functionalities into a single versatile hardware acceleration unit, called VPU, to replace the conventional ALU on a CPU. The proposed VPU can supply the general-purpose CPU with a rich set of operations, which may supersede some or even all of the heterogeneous cores. The superseded hardware components are removed to reduce the integration and communication overhead.

Using a subset of data from the California Statewide Pricing Pilot of 2003-04, average load change during summer events, annual percent bill change, and post-experiment satisfaction ratings are calculated across six customer segments, categorized by historical usage and income levels. Findings show that hi.-h-use customers respond significantly more in kW reduction than do low-use customers, while low-use customers save significantly more in percentage reduction of annual electricity bills than do high-use customers-results that challenge the strategy of targeting only high-use customers for CPP tariffs. Across income levels, average load and bill changes were statistically indistinguishable, as were satisfaction rates-results that are compatible with a strategy of full-scale implementation of CPP rates in the residential sector. Finally, the high-use customers earning less than $50,000 annually were the most likely of the groups to see bill increases-about 5% saw bill increases of 10% or more-suggesting that any residential CPP implementation might consider targeting this customer group for increased energy efficiency efforts.

The inter-component communication overhead, along with the engineering efforts required to integrate, verify, and validate such heterogeneous systems are scaled disproportionally as the complexity of such systems continue rising skyrocketedly. Moreover, due to limited instruction encoding space and the need to maintain back-ward compatibly in the future designs, designers are often forced to include only a very small subset of the total desired functionalities on chip, despite there can be more than sufficient silicon real estate to incorporate these specialized function units. This paper proposes a cost-effective technique of incorporating diverse functionalities into a single multi-purpose, streamlining acceleration unit, named Versatile Processing Unit (VPU), to replace the conventional ALU on a CPU. The proposed VPU can supply the general-purpose CPU with a rich set of streamlined operations, which may supersede some or even all of the heterogeneous cores. The superseded hardware components are removed to reduce the integration and communication overhead. The issues of limited instruction encoding space and future backward compatibility are resolved by our proposed dynamic instruction re-mapping technique, in which the instruction bit fields can be redefined on the fly to allow instruction space reuse at run time.",2007,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,318-325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000253310700041,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ISM 2007: NINTH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MULTIMEDIA, PROCEEDINGS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first part of this paper, detailed measurements for 11 ""Passive House"" projects with more than 100 dwelling units from the EU-funded demonstration project CEPHEUS (Cost Efficient Passive Houses as European Standards) are presented. All projects exhibit extraordinarily low space heat consumptions. Compared with ordinary, newly erected buildings, 80% of the space heat consumption could be saved. The total primary energy consumption (including household electricity) was less than 50% of that of conventional new buildings. The measurements show that the buildings also offer comfortable indoor conditions in both summer and winter. Several social research studies revealed that the users are well pleased with their homes. The second part of the paper focuses on low-income tenant's satisfaction in the world's first multi-story Passive Houses in Kassel, Germany. This building contrasts sharply with the ""standard"" Passive House, occupied by its owners. A 2.5 year study was conducted from spring of 2000 to autumn of 2002. The development of opinions, attitudes, behaviour, and satisfaction over time could be recorded. The building is a clear success, the tenant's satisfaction is high. It is concluded that this building type fulfils the conditions of sustainability in social, ecological and economic respects and should therefore be disseminated on a larger scale. To this end, the last part of the paper describes the development of the Passive House standard in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, from the first demonstration project in 1991 to about 3500 dwelling units today. The prerequisites for this development are analysed. Finally, the authors give their view about the political possibilities for pushing Passive Houses into the market as well as for stimulating a market pull for this comfortable and energy efficient building type.

Consequently, traditional architecture, all over the world, depended basically upon building materials available in the contiguous environment. These local materials are better suited to environmental conditions and purchases support area economies, like adobe, stone and palm trunks, which are theoretically renewable besides their efficient thermal performance. Sustainable building materials are usually part of society sustainable development for they often depend on local labor and available raw resources, which means that building with sustainable building materials contribute in housing affordability, offering in the same time, more employment opportunities. This leads to reduce poverty levels in many countries in the world. This paper aims to study the factor of choosing building materials that conform to the Gulf region, as an entrance for developing the process of facilitated housing, and illustrating the role of its contribution in rationalizing consumption of power sources.

The high quality of construction and a high level of the external building envelope (including the orientation of the house and an adequate relationship between the surface area and the building's volume) have reduced transmission and ventilation losses to a minimum. Additional insulation of the external building envelope raises the construction costs by 10-12 per cent and reduces heat losses through the house's envelope tenfold (from approximately 150 kWh/m(2) a year to less than 15 kWh/m(2)). The use of renewable energy sources for heating and electricity increases the costs of installing the energy supply system in the house and makes the construction in general more expensive by some 30 per cent. However, taking into account that no conventional heating system (and associated maintenance costs) is any longer necessary, that annual heat consumption of such a house is below 15 kWh/m(2) (total energy consumption is below 40 kWh/m(2)), the concept of a house self-sufficient in terms of energy becomes absolutely cost-effective in the short and in the long run. The system is even more cost-effective if such houses are grouped in villages or settlements of 8-10 houses, when the major part of the energy supply system may be provided from a central source. Viewing the past activities related to deliberations about energy future of the County Splitsko-dalmatinska, an ecological house, self-sufficient in terms of energy, as an element of an autonomous solar village intended for rural tourism on islands is a logical continuation of a practical implementation of research results regarding energy development of the County.

Its extended thermal insulation and enhanced air-tightness removes the need for temperatures higher than 50 degreesC. This makes renewable energy sources particularly suitable for heating, cooling and domestic hot water production. Modeling of renewable energy usage for space heating requires as a preliminary stage the detailed description of the building structure, of the HVAC equipment and of the internal heat sources. This paper shows the main data used to model the thermal behavior of a passive house. Details about Pirmasens Passive House (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany) are given, as for example, the internal heat sources, including electric appliances, heat and humidity released by human bodies, thermal internal facilities as hot and cold water pipes.

This may impact upon the possibility for low-income families to purchase and utilise energy efficient home appliances. The aim of the study is to access the present degree of difficulty that low income families in Italy have in purchasing high efficiency refrigerator/freezers and clothes washers. Results show that, given their substantially lower level of expenditure for household appliances, the higher prices of energy efficient models represent an obstacle for these families in Italy to overcome energy inefficiency and energy poverty. an important input to energy policy. Over two million 600 thousand families, 11.9 percent of the total families in 1999 are estimated to be below the poverty threshold based upon consumption. An independent survey shows that these families possess less technologically advanced models, keeping them for a much longer period of 36 years, more than double the recommended lifetime of 15 years, and four times the national average of nine years. This technical disadvantage is aggravated by the additional operating costs of the more inefficient models. The higher prices of the more efficient models make it difficult for the poor families to afford them. Even at the annualised price of the average refrigerator - belonging to the energy efficiency C class - the annual expenditure of the poor families in Italy is less than half that necessary to purchase this model, consistent with the longer turnover rates. According to latest statistics in 1999, the B model is priced 70% above the C model in Italy, making it very difficult for poor families to purchase the more efficient models. Extrapolating the relative consumption data to other European countries and comparing it to local prices indicates that the situation may be similar in other EU Member States. The implications for energy and social policy are clear: without some form of public incentive it is unlikely that poor families in Italy will purchase the energy efficient models, remaining in an energy poverty trap for many years to come.",2001,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,529-540,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000167495500056,,,,,,,,,"Bertoldi, P; Ricci, A; DeAlmeida, A",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES AND LIGHTING,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the rural areas mostly traditional fuels like fuelwood are used which are at available to the households at zero monetary cost. The availability of these traditional fuels like fuelwood is becoming severely restricted due to fast depletion of the local forests and the non-availability of an alternative source of fuel. Based on the consumption expenditure patterns it can be observed that the expenditure on fuel which is at a subsistence level in the beginning will slowly shift towards commercial forms of energy for the sake of convenience and energy efficiency. The responsiveness of fuel expenditure for changes in income, and the type of fuel used has not been done for All India. This study addresses the shifts in the fuel source with an increase in income, in the framework of energy ladder. Fuel - wise demand for energy was also studied. The energy ladder is a concept used to describe the way in which households will move to more sophisticated fuels as their income increases. For this national sample survey data given by the NSSO for all India rural and urban areas was used. The rounds covered were 27, 28, 32, and 38. Four main fuels were chosen for study, namely, coke, fuelwood, kerosene, and electricity. It was found that in the rural areas, there was an increase in the use of kerosene and electricity over the rounds. In the urban areas, all the fuels first registered an increase, then decreased in the 38th round, showing the possibility that other fuel sources may have assumed importance in the household sector, like LPG. In the case of expenditure on energy according to income (expenditure) classes, the rural areas registered a decrease in the expenditure with the increase in income. On the other hand, the urban areas showed an increase in the total expenditure on energy with an increase in income.",1997,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,316-326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:A1997BH34N00029,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"ENERGY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: IS SUSTAINABLE GROWTH POSSIBLE?, VOLS 1-3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present results from an analysis of aggregated account-level utility billing data for energy consumption across the over two million properties in Los Angeles County. Results show that consumption in L.A. County varies widely with geography, income, building characteristics, and climate. Several higher-income areas have greater total energy use per building even in cooler climates, while many lower-income regions rank higher for energy use per square-foot. Energy consumption also correlates with building age, which varies widely throughout the region. Our results demonstrate the many complex and interrelated factors that influence urban energy use. While billing data is critical for devising energy efficiency programs that actually realize estimated savings and promote more sustainable cities, opening access to such data presents significant challenges for protecting personal privacy. The presented approach is adaptable and scalable to cities seeking to develop data-driven policies to reduce building energy use.

Prevention of this transfer via conservation increases household disposable income, which in turn, impacts areas like the local tax base, sales, and jobs.  It follows that a strong relationship can exist between energy efficiency and economic development.  In some areas, optimal energy conservation can be achieved without government intervention due to market incentives.

This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of Al Sa'fat with emphasis on building energy performance, shedding light on its effectiveness, limitations, and techno-economic potential. Following a comparison of Al Sa'fat to international and regional GBRSs, a detailed energy-efficiency analysis is conducted using building performance simulations applied to local residential and commercial building archetypes. The benefits of adopting Al Sa'fat at the urban scale are then estimated using a macro techno-economic analysis. Results confirm the potential of Al Sa'fat in curbing current consumption patterns with energy savings ranging from 22% for hotel buildings to 63% for single-family villas. The anticipated monetary savings from adopting Al Sa'fat in Dubai are equally significant and could exceed USD 100 Billion over the next 25 years. Finally, recommendations are made to overcome critical limitations of Al Sa'fat, including the minimal emphasis on water efficiency measures and limited differentiation between its current certification levels (i.e., bronze, silver, gold, and platinum), which could discourage building owners and developers from pursuing high certification levels.",2021-10,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,1,,,157,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This trend represents an opportunity to upgrade the energy performance of the existing building stock in older, more walkable downtowns and to achieve preservation goals. Some advocates of building reuse resist imposing the cost of energy improvements on associated projects, while many energy efficiency advocates do not distinguish how the opportunities and constraints differ between new and existing buildings. Building code officials experience this tension when reviewing improvements to existing buildings, and many find that sections of the widely adopted International Energy Conservation Code are pragmatically unenforceable. In this study we examine the existing-building energy challenge using a mixed-methods approach within one region as well as a national-level analysis of governmental data. The authors characterize promising regulatory strategies including exempting historic buildings (which is the status quo), exempting smaller buildings and less energy-intensive occupancies and systems, and creating simple lookup tables that provide succinct guidance to redevelopers and code officials. Code officials enforce longstanding life-safety codes more assiduously than they do the newer energy codes, and these codes need revisions to make them more cost effective and enforceable. A better understanding and implementation of building energy codes can have positive implications for both energy performance and downtown revitalization. Success depends on better managing interdependencies among the national policy objective of energy efficiency, the ubiquitous local planning objective of downtown revitalization, and the bureaucratic challenges of regulating construction in existing buildings.

Prior to 2010, participation in the rating scheme was voluntary. This study first develops a theoretical model of mandatory disclosure policy effectiveness. Then, with a dataset of all ratings since inception of the voluntary regime in 1999, it tests the expectation that initial voluntary adopters have a greater tendency towards environmental stewardship and are more likely to manage and invest in environmental performance improvements, potentially dampening the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure policy. However, multiple statistical models of certification are unable to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in energy efficiency outcomes between the mandatory and voluntary adopters at equivalent stages. For urban policymakers, the extrapolation of voluntary adopter performance appears to be a good -- perhaps even conservative -- estimation of mandatory energy performance disclosure outcomes.

By connecting the geographies of students and energy, this paper aims to assess the magnitude of all‐inclusive energy packages and its effects on students’ residential choices. Based on an online survey distributed to students at Loughborough University (UK), the paper shows that 80% of housing occupied by students is energy‐inclusive. These rental commodities are strongly considered by students, particularly new university entrants, in their housing choices, 70% of whom considered all‐inclusive rent to be an important factor in their residential choice. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that all‐inclusive energy packages are extensively provided throughout the student housing market: from the low‐energy efficient houses in multiple occupancy to the newly developed purpose‐built student accommodation.

Policy makers are increasingly concerned about this energy efficiency gap. In this paper, we investigate the energy investments made and the market efficiency gains associated with different policy interventions at the point of lease. We introduce key features of the housing rental market in the laboratory and examine four policy options: mandatory information on energy efficiency, voluntary information, mandatory minimum standards, and a 'cost-share' treatment (i.e., landlords pay a share of the tenants' energy bill). We find that enabling landlords to post the energy efficiency of their properties increases investment in energy efficiency. Voluntary information achieves efficiency levels comparable to those under a mandatory programme but may lead to lower levels of tenant participation. Mandatory minimum standards lead to higher investments in energy efficiency, but also reduce the number of properties available for lease. Cost-sharing leads to low market efficiency levels, perhaps due to the uncertainty landlords face regarding the energy bill of their tenants.

Expired provisions include those that support renewable electricity (the production tax credit (PTC)), provisions that support energy efficiency in both residential and commercial buildings, and tax credits for certain biofuels and other alternative fuels. Like the 113th Congress, the 114th Congress may choose to address expired energy tax provisions. The Tax Increase Prevention Act (P.L. 113-295), enacted late in the 113th Congress, temporarily extended, through 2014, most expired energy tax provisions. The Tax Relief Extension Act of 2015 (S. 1946) proposes extending expired energy tax provisions for two years, through 2016. Energy tax policy may also be considered as part of comprehensive tax reform legislation. A base-broadening approach to tax reform might consider the elimination of various energy tax expenditures in conjunction with a reduction in overall tax rates. This was the approach taken in the Tax Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 1), introduced late in the 113th Congress by then-Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Dave Camp. Alternative revenue sources, such as a carbon tax, may also be evaluated as part of the tax reform process. The Obama Administration has also proposed a number of changes to energy tax policy as part of its annual budget proposal. In the past, the Administration has proposed repealing a number of existing tax incentives for fossil fuels, while providing new or expanded incentives for carbon sequestration, alternative and advanced technology vehicles, renewable electricity, energy efficiency, and advanced energy manufacturing. Energy tax policy involves the use of one of the government's main fiscal instruments, taxes (both as an incentive and as a disincentive) to alter the allocation or configuration of energy resources and their use. In theory, energy taxes and subsidies, like tax policy instruments in general, are intended either to correct a problem or distortion in the energy markets or to achieve some economic (efficiency, equity, or even macroeconomic) objective. The economic rationale for government intervention in energy markets is commonly based on the government's perceived ability to correct for market failures. Market failures, such as externalities, principal-agent problems, and informational asymmetries, result in an economically inefficient allocation of resources-in which society does not maximize well-being. To correct for these market failures governments can utilize several policy options, including taxes, subsidies, and regulation, in an effort to achieve policy goals. In practice, energy tax policy in the United States is made in a political setting, determined by fiscal dictates and the views and interests of the key players in this setting, including policymakers, special interest groups, and academic scholars. As a result, enacted tax policy embodies compromises between economic and political goals, which could either mitigate or compound existing distortions.",2016,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,1,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper explores the benefits of using coconut fibre composite as a passive cooling roof and quantifies those benefits in terms of heat flow changes through field experiment and compares them to the base case of standard roof in arid regions. The research also focussed on the usage of this material in combination with radiation reflectors such as aluminium and the effect of air gap between coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector on the energy efficiency of the buildings. Experimental investigation showed a substantial reduction in room air and concrete roof slab temperature of coconut fibre composite with aluminium reflector room in comparison with the conventional roof. A maximum reduction of 5.99 °C (16.59%) and 8.39 °C (23.8%) were observed in room air and roof slab temperature of coconut fibre composite–aluminium roof with an air gap of 40 cm between them. It was also observed that as the air gap between coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector is increased, the room air and roof slab temperature were reduced due to enhanced convective cooling. Compared to a standard roof, the indoor air temperature of coconut fibre composite roof was reduced by a maximum of 2.2 °C (5.86%), 2.9 °C and 5.99 °C (16.59%) for 0, 20 and 40 cm air gap between the coconut fibre composite and aluminium reflector, respectively.

In 2011 and 2012, the Chinese Government selected four cities -- Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and Chongqing -- to implement pilot commercial building energy efficiency retrofit program. Based on site surveys and expert interviews in these pilot cities, this research conducted a comparative analysis on incentive policies of local city level. The analysis results show that policy designs of existing commercial buildings should be further improved. The aspects that influence the implementation effect in the future, such as subsidy level, installments, and business model promotion, should be specified in the policy clauses. Referring to the technical solution and cost-benefit in Chongqing, we found that lighting system is the most common retrofit objects while envelope system is the least common one. And the subsidy incentive is greatest for educational buildings, followed by office buildings. In the end, we further discussed the problems and obstacles in commercial building retrofit market, and provided a series of recommendations.

The question is how to achieve the deep carbon emission reductions from existing domestic properties, of which 75% will still be in use in 2050. Government has sought to provide incentives to homeowners to improve the energy efficiency of their households, and mandate improvements in socially rented housing using a range of fiscal measures, most recently the 'Green Deal'.

The standard was recently updated in 2014 to increase energy savings targets by 30% compared with the 2005 standard. This paper reviews the major changes to the standard, including expansion of energy efficiency coverage and more stringent efficiency requirements. The paper also discusses the interrelationship of the design standard with China's other building energy standards. Furthermore, comparisons are made with ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 to provide contrasting differences in efficiency requirements.

This paper empirically tests the impact of subsidized housing regulations on the energy efficiency of multi-family housing for low-income households. We begin by constructing a unique database that integrates actual energy use with physical, socioeconomic, and regulatory characteristics of all large multifamily properties in New York City, focusing on whether a property receives a federal rental subsidy. We employ multivariate regression models to examine the factors that influence energy consumption in multi-family buildings and compare subsidized housing to market-rate housing, controlling for a range of building and household characteristics. We find that subsidized properties are associated with higher energy consumption than similar market-rate properties and, of the subsidized housing programs, Public Housing tends to consume the most energy. Our results suggest that despite the potential for retrofitting multifamily properties, and associated cost, energy, and carbon emissions savings, regulatory factors constrain investment and consumption decisions in the case of subsidized properties. Reducing energy use in subsidized housing, therefore, rests on modifying existing regulations.",2017-07,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,505,,,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use a sample of 585,578 residential properties in the Republic of Ireland - a region that legally requires rental properties to display energy performance certificates when advertised. The findings suggest that the landlord-tenant problem is present in the Irish rental market but that it is not uniform across locations, indicating the influence of other factors. To explore this further, we exploit the regional variation in rental property prices. We find a larger difference between rental and non-rental properties' energy efficiency in markets with scarcity in rental property supply.

A separate estimation by subgroups reveals that the price premium is primarily driven by wealthier households that exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay for eco-labeled condominiums, both as a total amount and as a fraction of the total sales price. Less affluent households are also shown to pay higher prices for the eco label but the effect is less pronounced. The results indicate that capitalised utility bill savings are likely to account for a large proportion of the observed premium but the higher premium paid by affluent households suggests that more intangible benefits of living in a green building may also play a role.

In the era of energy conservation, which results from environmental requirements, as well as from constantly increasing energy prices, the energy consumption of premises and buildings becomes an important prerequisite for decision-making processes in the real estate market. There have also been changes in the provisions of the Act on Real Estate Management, which impose an obligation on the professional group of property appraisers to incorporate energy performance certificates for buildings and premises into the valuation process. Energy intensity in terms of the demand for heating of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units.Purpose: The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high-rise buildings) and the diverse distribution of units in the building, especially with regard to their exposure to the different point of the compass. The research covered the Słoneczne housing estate in Szczecin, in a situation where the property appraiser does not have access to the energy performance certificates of the estimated apartments as well as apartments taken for comparison. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between energy intensity and market value of residential units on the selected real estate market. The analysis will be based on data from the Price and Value Register of the County Office, a collection of statistics and public information as well as on the authors’ own databases and research.Research methodology: A multidimensional analysis will be used to distinguish homogeneous groups of residential units due to their property attributes. The study will also employ a valuation model including energy intensity and time variables.Results: The study showed that building type is one of the features determining energy consumption by a building. Depending on the period, the introduced attributes explained the evolution of the unit price at 78%, 75% and 24%. The parameters of the variables Size, Neighborhood and Time were found to be statistically significant. What is more, in all three periods, the value of the residential unit was significantly affected by the type of building which determined the energy performance of the building.Novelty: Energy intensity in terms of the heating demand of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units.

We find that rents are lower for apartments with higher energy consumption, even in neighborhoods with lower levels of green awareness. This relationship is stronger in neighborhoods with higher purchasing power, such that communities with low levels of green awareness and high purchasing power show the steepest negative slope for increasing energy consumption (−8.6% from the highest to lowest rating). Thus, the rent-decreasing effect of purchasing power is higher than that of green awareness. Splitting the entire period into smaller windows, we find that the interaction effect of green awareness has emerged in the most recent years (2017–2019). This may be driven by changes in regulation, which have made it easier for tenants to assess the energy consumption before they rent, or by a general increase in green awareness over this period.",2021-02,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,220-241,,2,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper describes a research project that focuses on a comprehensive analysis and documentation of an energy-efficient low-income / close to market rate housing development in Park City, Utah, USA. The project consists of 13 single-family residences that will mainly be constructed with Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs). The project will monitor and analyze building cost and construction efficacy of the energy efficient buildings and their components, and compare it to standard constructions in the Northern Utah Cold Climate Zone. The US Department of Energy DOE sponsors the research project as part of a strategy to transform the US housing market towards an energy-efficient, sustainable industry. Part of the strategy is to provide actors of that industry, which are mainly developers, contractors, and builders, with valuable knowledge on how to build energy-efficient houses. Despite comprehensive research in the field of energy-efficient buildings during the last two decades, most of the results have not reached the US architecture/engineering/construction (AEC) industries in the field of residential buildings yet. The paper will report on the project’s progress to analyze the specific building design, materials, components, and construction methods, to evaluate the strategies that will lead to a higher energy-efficiency compared to a traditional building. Obstacles and barriers that occur during the construction period will be comprehensively analyzed and compared to standard construction methods to better understand the resistance of the housing building industry towards new construction methods.",2010,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,151,,2,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selling price is determined by both rents and occupancy; therefore the impact of efficient design on commercial sales activity should be distributed through the leasing market. The model is tested empirically using a national sample of sales and leasing data for class A office buildings. The evidence indicates that ""green"" buildings achieve superior rents and sustain significantly higher occupancy. The improved performance in the rental market is reflected in a significant premium for the selling price of Energy Star-labeled and LEED-certified properties.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",2010-08,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,228,,2,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through an assessment of the geographical and temporal variation in domestic energy-efficiency assessments provided under the United Kingdom's Green Deal, the factors underpinning the spatial diffusion of this policy are identified. Spatial regression models show that the presence of young families, university educated residents, detached homes, and large households positively affects the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments whereas property market activity, personal incomes, the presence of self-employed residents, and the efficiency levels of the existing housing stock has a dampening effect. National incentives for policy implementation that are distributed through selected local authorities also work to promote the uptake of energy-efficiency assessments. Overall, the analysis clearly shows the importance of local factors in determining how national policies are implemented on the ground.

These policies, known as disclosure or information policies, require owners to benchmark their buildings and sometimes conduct engineering audits. However, given substantial variation in the cost to disclose different types of information, it is natural to ask: how much and what kind of information about building energy performance should be disclosed, and for what purposes? To answer this question, this paper assembles and cleans a comprehensive panel dataset of New York City multifamily buildings, and analyzes its predictive power using a Bayesian multilevel regression model. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals that building-level variation is the most important factor in explaining building energy use, and that there are few, if any, relationships of building systems to observed energy use. This indicates that disclosure laws requiring benchmarking data may be relatively more useful than engineering audits in explaining the observed energy performance of existing buildings. These results should inform the further development of information disclosure laws.

The findings demonstrate that functionality and accessibility remain top priorities in occupiers' choice of premises. Lower rents, improved corporate image and productivity are revealed as attributes that could compensate occupiers for energy-efficient attributes that restrict control over internal environment and operation of equipment.

Forty percent of the floorspace in China is in rural villages and towns. Most of these buildings are very energy inefficient, and may struggle to provide for basic needs. They are cold in the winter, and often experience indoor air pollution from fuel use. The Chinese government plans to adopt a voluntary building energy code, or design standard, for rural homes. The goal is to build on China's success with codes in urban areas to improve efficiency and comfort in rural homes. The Chinese government recognizes rural buildings represent a major opportunity for improving national building energy efficiency. The challenges of rural China are also greater than those of urban areas in many ways because of the limited local capacity and low income levels. The Chinese government wants to expand on new programs to subsidize energy efficiency improvements in rural homes to build capacity for larger-scale improvement. This article summarizes the trends and status of rural building energy use in China. It then provides an overview of the new rural building design standard, and describes options and issues to move forward with implementation.

By applying life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA), this study aimed to determine whether the use of VEEP PCE leads to lower carbon emission and lower associated costs over the life cycle of an exemplary four‐story residential building in the Netherlands than a business‐as‐usual (BAU) PCE scenario. This paper provides a case study on the alignment and/or integration of LCA and LCC in an independent and a combined manner (via monetization). This study examines how the internalization of carbon emission and discount rate will affect the final life cycle costs over a 40‐year life span. The simulation results show that the key to economic viability and environmental soundness of VEEP PCE is to reduce production cost and to optimize the thermal performance of the novel isolation material Aerogel; internalization of external cost monetarizes the environmental advantage thus slightly expands the cost advantage of low carbon options, but leads to larger uncertainty about the LCC result.",2020-10,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,1016-1030,,5,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It appears that these amounts could be reduced substantially, with benefits to both household budgets and the environment's well-being. This paper's goal is to evaluate the alternative mechanisms that could expedite energy efficiency retrofits for U.S. housing. We begin by evaluating the evidence that significant improvements in the energy efficiency of existing U.S. housing are feasible, both technologically and financially. We compare the relatively optimistic positions taken in McKinsey and Company (2009a,b), EPRI (2009), and Harcourt, Brown, and Carey (2011) versus the less optimistic appraisal in Allcott and Greenstone (2012). We conclude that significant energy savings do appear to be both technologically and financially feasible. The remainder of the paper considers the bottlenecks that hamper energy-saving investments for the residential sector.

Cities have been promoting low carbon city (LCC) strategies to reduce carbon emissions and various methods have been introduced to assess the performance of LCC strategies. However, most of the existing assessment methods focus on overall LCC performance at city level, but the effects of individual dimensions like industrial structure and energy efficiency are ignored. The research question in this study therefore is whether an alternative method can be established to measure both the overall and dimensional LCC performance. This paper introduces a method for assessing LCC performance by using Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which is called LCC-CMM. The proposed method of LCC-CMM can help identify LCC maturity grade through assessing the performance of individual LCC dimensions which contributes to overall performance. There are four procedures in applying LCC-CMM, including to identify the Key Process Areas (KPAs) in the context of LCC, denoted as LCC-KPAs, to define the indicators for measuring the performance of LCC-KPAs, to calculate the performance score for each LCC-KPA, and to define criteria for specifying different grades of LCC capability maturity. The proposed method is proven effective through a case demonstration. The method can help policy makers to identify weak areas in LCC practice and introduce tailor-made policy measures to improve the weak areas.",2021-03,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,106549,,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyze data from a 2009 survey of more than 400 owner-occupiers of single-family detached, semidetached, and row houses in Germany, that was conducted as a computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI). In the survey, respondents were asked directly for reasons for and against retrofitting their homes, but also faced a choice experiment involving different energy retrofit measures. Overall, we find that house owners who are able to afford it financially, for whom it is profitable, and for whom there is a favorable opportunity are more likely to undertake energy retrofit activities. The latter point seems to be of particular importance in explaining the persistent low retrofit rate in Germany. Our results suggest that professional energy advice could stimulate the demand for building energy retrofits.

The aim is to assess the overall socio-economic impact of energy saving renovation measures defined in Croatian strategic documents in terms of the direct, indirect and induced growth of gross value added, employment and government revenues. An estimate of the avoided costs of air pollution is also included. The overall economic impact assessment is based on an input-output methodology. From the point of view of individual investors, the benefits in terms of reduced future expenses related to energy products are usually below energy efficient renovation investment costs, making an investment financially viable only if government support is provided. If the benefits for society as a whole are included, energy efficient renovation could be assessed as viable even in the short-run. Energy saving retrofits of residential and public buildings positively contribute to economic growth, employment and protection of the environment. Because of economic growth, the tax revenues induced by these investments could compensate for government expenditures, and the overall impact on the public deficit is expected to be neutral even in the short-run.

In 2008, more than 15% of total new construction received the Swiss energy building label Minergie. The spatial distribution of these green buildings, however, is highly heterogeneous. In some regions, more than half of the new dwellings are built according to the Swiss green building standard. In others, this share is still negligible. The purpose of this paper is to identify the determinants of the distribution of green housing. For 2,571 Swiss municipalities, the author computes the green building share of new residential buildings. Data are collected for several variables measuring demographic, geographic, social, cultural, and political aspects that - according to the authors' hypothesis - may influence green building activity. Count regression is used to estimate the impact of these variables on the demand for green buildings. It is found that differences in income levels and cultural affiliation between Swiss municipalities account for the largest part of the variation in green building activity. The impact of homeowners' stance on environmentalism is highly significant but less important. Government subsidies do not seem to trigger additional green housing activity. The paper presents one of the first empirical analyses regarding the determinants of green building activity. Thanks to a comprehensive dataset, the authors are able to investigate the impact of potential drivers of ""green housing"" construction activity. The regional variation in governmental incentives is analysed and delivers valuable insight for policymakers interested in spurring the development of green buildings.",2011,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,86-102,,1,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a reaction to this, the Turkish government has implemented the Strategic Energy Efficiency Plan (SEEP), which provides a guideline for energy efficiency policies in all sectors. The aim of this study is to analyse the potential of the SEEP on final energy demand in the Turkish residential sector until 2030. Three scenarios are developed based on a detailed bottom-up modelling approach using a vintage stock model to simulate the energy demand of heating systems and appliances. The results show a decreasing final energy demand in the reference scenario from about 944 PJ in 2008 to 843 PJ in 2030. This reflects a structural break, which is mainly caused by a high building demolition rate and low efficiency in the existing building stock. The SEEP achieves additional savings of around 111 PJ until 2030, while a scenario with even higher efficiency shows further savings of 91 PJ. Electricity demand increases in all scenarios -- mainly due to growing ownership rates of appliances. The SEEP will achieve around 10 TWh of electricity savings in 2030 compared to the reference scenario, mainly through more ambitious end-use standards.",2014-07,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 18:05,,14,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant legal scholarship offers alternative models of 'smart,' 'responsive' environmental regulation, emphasising the need for policy instrument mixes, including the vital role of voluntary, industry-led sustainability standards. Yet, as is being increasingly recognised, these contributions leave open the need for detailed, qualitative evaluation of instrument mixes as a complement to primarily quantitative cost-benefit analyses that predominate in regulatory impact assessments by governments. Addressing this need, this paper evaluates policy and standards for low and zero carbon homes in England during the Coalition government (2010-2015) when the ecological modernisation discourse of the previous New Labour government became subsumed by a deregulation agenda. Our study, incorporating 70 stakeholder interviews, suggests that, in supplier-driven markets such as housing in England, a 'smart' mix of mandatory and voluntary standards requires a strong, central role for government in setting national, mandatory standards and supporting their delivery. There is an important potential supplementary role for voluntary tools and local authority discretion, though our study highlights problems that can arise when such different instruments promote diverging roadmaps towards a policy goal.",2017-11,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,490,,,110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It considers parameters such as buildings age, built-up area, type of heating system, type of fuel used, adjacency, insulation of roofs and walls and energy consumption etc. for an in depth analysis. This study concludes that about 69% of buildings which are constructed before 1945 needs serious renovation towards the improvement of roof and external wall insulation level. It then successfully identifies specific areas which need detailed study to evaluate the comfort status in the existing building stock, improvement of insulation level and its effect on heating energy consumption as well as the economic analysis on energy efficiency measurements.

The UK faces a major challenge to improve the thermal performance of its existing housing stock. Millions of dwellings possess 'hard-to-treat' solid walls and have glazing which is not cost effective to improve. A range of fabric efficiency incentive schemes exist, but many do not target the full range of private and social housing. From now on, the Green Deal will be the UK's key energy efficiency policy. However, the scheme is forecasted to have low consumer appeal and low incentives for investors. Moreover, calculated Green Deal loan repayments will be reliant upon estimated energy savings, yet it is claimed that retrofit measures may only be half as effective as anticipated due to a lack of monitoring, poor quality installation and the increased use of heating following refurbishment. Looking to Germany, there has been success through the Passivhaus standard, but the UK currently lacks appropriate skills and cost effective components to replicate this approach. In addition, the embodied energy in retrofit products and materials threatens to counter operational savings.

However, there is little evidence backed up by measured data to validate the actual effectiveness of BEES in China. Using survey data collected from 1128 households in Chongqing China, this study applied the propensity scores matching method to estimate the effect of two BEES levels: the 50%-BEES (low level) and the 65%-BEES (high level). Results show that buildings built with 65%-BEES, on average, can reduce cooling and heating electricity use intensity (kWh/m2/a) by 41%, compared to buildings in the absence of the BEES. Meanwhile, the adoption of 50%-BEES can reduce cooling and heating electricity use intensity (kWh/m2/a) by 38%. However, energy savings are not significant if comparing buildings with 65%-BEES and 50%-BEES. The results indicate that there exists a performance gap between calculated design performance savings and actual operation energy savings. These empirical findings provide policymakers with valuable feedback on buildings' actual performance. The findings suggest that it is necessary to incorporate outcome-based compliance pathways into the current BEES system.

Second, by situating it within the literature related to organizational culture, occupant behaviours, and technology adoption. The paper begins with a brief review of the existing research on people, energy and commercial buildings. This literature tends to address either organizational choices, or occupant behavior, but it rarely crosses the analytical boundaries between these two groups. The paper then explores these different levels of analysis within a 3Cs -- ""concern, capacity, and conditions"" -- framework, which was developed to describe and distinguish organizational responses to an energy crisis. The combination of the ""building communities"" and 3Cs frames reveals gaps and grey areas between organizational culture, occupant behaviour, and technology adoption where further conservation opportunities may lie. These understudied areas suggest that there may be ""social potential"" for change that is between and beyond the frames used by previous research in the field.

To address this need, the government created a programme called ""My house, My life"". The main subsidies of the programme are for families earning up to three times the minimum wage. In order to formulate strategies for more energy efficiency buildings, it is necessary to understand the thermal and energy performance of what is being built. This article defines representative projects for typologies being built in the Brazilian social housing sector through the analysis of 108 projects considering two groups of income levels and investigates the thermal and energy performance of the representative projects in relation to the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labelling of Residential Buildings in Brazil for two bioclimatic zones. Five representative building models were defined. Considering the most common features found on the sample, the study suggests the importance of addresing energy efficiency measures on the sector since current building techniques for social housing shows a tendency towards a low performance in relation to the thermal and energy performance criteria of the Energy Labelling especially for lower income projects. This provides a basis for future policy and allows for more in depth studies within the sector.

Our method is based on the artificial generation of a large building sample, where the buildings are defined by geometric and other parameters. Due to the large number of combinations, the effect of many variables appear in the results, with the deviations reflecting the sensitivity of the energy balance. The requirements are set based on some fundamental considerations and the statistical analysis of the sample. The method is demonstrated on the example of setting the requirements for residential buildings in Hungary. The proposed requirements are validated against the common European targets. The suggested method is suitable for developing building energy regulation threshold values, certification schemes or benchmarking values.",2014-11,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:49,,510,,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper uses quasi-experimental variation in commercial building energy standard adoptions to estimate their effect on realized electricity consumption and cost-effectiveness. In states induced by EPAct to adopt an energy standard where all new nonresidential construction was erected under a commercial standard, electricity consumption per service worker is lower by about 12%, and total commercial electricity consumption is lower by 10%. Including early adopters and never-adopters to the analysis leads to a downward bias in the treatment effect.

The method determines a combination of energy saving measures that have been optimised in regards to the future cost for energy. Subsequently, the method evaluates the cost of undertaking the retrofit measures as compared to the cost of demolishing the existing building and thereafter erecting a new one. Several economically beneficial combinations of energy saving measures can be determined. All of them are a trade-off between investing in retrofit measures and buying renewable energy. The overall cost of the renovation considers the market value of the property, the investment in the renovation, the operational and maintenance costs. A multi-family building is used as an example to clearly illustrate the application of the method from macroeconomic and private financial perspectives. The example shows that the investment cost and future market value of the building are the dominant factors in deciding whether to renovate an existing building or to demolish it and thereafter erect a new building.

However, exemplary buildings demonstrate the feasibility of much better energy performance at no additional first cost. This research examines one possible explanation for this inconsistency. The aim is to investigate whether the anchoring bias, which refers to our tendency to gravitate towards a pre-defined standard regardless of its relevance, influences energy performance goals in building design. The scope examines professionals who help set energy performance goals for U.S. buildings. Prior to being asked to set an energy performance goal, these professionals were randomly directed to one of three series of questions. One series set an anchor of 90% energy reduction beyond standard practice, one set a 30% anchor, and one set no anchor. Respondents exposed to the 90% anchor, and respondents exposed to no anchor at all, set higher energy performance goals than respondents exposed to the 30% anchor. These results suggest that building rating systems that only reward incremental energy improvements may inadvertently create anchors, thereby discouraging more advanced energy performance goals and inhibiting energy performance that is technically and economically feasible.

We argue that the links between energy efficiency programs in commercial buildings should be conceptualized in a comprehensive manner by evaluating the strategic drivers that have ultimately led to the emergence of the principal forms of voluntary programs: economic incentives; certifications; alliances and partnerships; and internal company programs. We develop a conceptual framework that helps building owners and managers: identify the primary drivers for energy efficiency efforts; assess the efficacy and limitations of available program forms; apply each program form strategically in conjunction with a number of other program forms; and, ultimately, predict the emergence of new program forms.

But the combined effect of these two progressions is more controversial. A reduced heat demand (HD) due to higher energy efficiency in buildings might hamper co-production of electricity and DH. In Sweden, co-produced electricity is normally considered to displace electricity from less efficient European condensing power plants. In this study, a potential HD reduction due to energy efficiency measures in the existing building stock in the Swedish city Linkoping is calculated. The impact of HD reduction on heat and electricity production in the Linkoping DH system is investigated by using the energy system optimisation model MODEST. Energy efficiency measures in buildings reduce seasonal HD variations. Model results show that HD reductions primarily decrease heat-only production. The electricity-to-heat output ratio for the system is increased for HD reductions up to 30%. Local and global CO""2 emissions are reduced. If co-produced electricity replaces electricity from coal-fired condensing power plants, a 20% HD reduction is optimal for decreasing global CO""2 emissions in the analysed DH system.

This analysis quantifies the day-to-day and embodied energy consumption of four different neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, to examine how built environment variations influence various sources of urban energy consumption. A microsimulation combines models for petroleum use (from driving) and residential and commercial power and natural gas use with rigorously measured building stock and infrastructure materials quantities (to arrive at embodied energy). Results indicate that the more suburban neighborhoods, with mostly detached single-family homes, consume up to 320% more embodied energy, 150% more operational energy, and about 160% more total life-cycle energy (per capita) than a densely developed neighborhood with mostly low-rise-apartments and duplexes. Across all neighborhoods, operational energy use comprised 83 to 92% of total energy use, and transportation sources (including personal vehicles and transit, plus street, parking structure, and sidewalk infrastructure) made up 44 to 47% of the life-cycle energy demands tallied. Energy elasticity calculations across the neighborhoods suggest that increased population density and reduced residential unit size offer greatest life-cycle energy savings per capita, by reducing both operational demands from driving and home energy use, and from less embodied energy from construction. These results provide measurable metrics for comparing different neighborhood styles and develop a framework to anticipate energy-savings from changes in the built environment versus household energy efficiency.

This paper discusses a comprehensive approach to achieving low carbon sustainability in large commercial buildings in China incorporating both energy and carbon-reduction strategies. The approach concentrates primarily on three complementary aspects: (a) the introduction of an effective energy management system; (b) the incorporation of relevant advanced energy saving technologies and measures and (c) the promotion of awareness among occupants to make changes in their behaviour towards a more environmental-friendly behaviour. However, reference is also made to the role that renewable energy and offsetting may have in the effective management and environmental performance of buildings. Nine examples of large commercial buildings in Beijing and Shanghai were studied and the average electricity consumption of around 153 kWh/m^sub 2^ per annum is about 5 times higher than average electricity use in residential buildings. At the same time the associated green house gas (GHG) emissions are around 158 kg/m^sub 2^ per annum.

A process-based hybrid life-cycle assessment model is used to quantify the life-cycle energy use for both urban and rural residential buildings in China and determine the energy use characteristics of each life cycle phase. An input-output model for the pre-use phases is based on 2007 Chinese economic benchmark data. A process-based life-cycle assessment model for estimating the operation and demolition phases uses historical energy-intensity data. Results show that operation energy in both urban and rural residential buildings is dominant and varies from 75% to 86% of life cycle energy respectively. Gaps in living standards as well as differences in building structure and materials result in a life-cycle energy intensity of urban residential buildings that is 20% higher than that of rural residential buildings. The life-cycle energy of urban residential buildings is most sensitive to the reduction of operational energy intensity excluding heating energy which depends on both the occupants' energy-saving behavior as well as the performance of the building itself.

Using quantile regression, this analysis assesses the relationship between energy consumption and predictors at the middle and both ends of the distribution (10th and 90th percentiles). Results indicate potential opportunities to lower consumption among the highest energy-consuming households including those with pools, with non-central cooling, with people working from home, those built on pier/post foundation, and those that are renter-occupied. These findings suggest significant opportunities to reduce consumption and demand as in the study area, almost 10% of housing units are renter-occupied, 18% percent are without central cooling, and 7% have pools.

In particular, detailed energy simulation analyses coupled with economical and environmental assessments are carried out to assess the thermal, economical, and environmental impacts of glazing thermal characteristics as well as window sizes associated with housing units in various representative climates within South Korea. The results of the analyses have clearly indicated that selecting glazing with low solar heat gain coefficient is highly beneficial especially for large windows and for mild climates.

While Suchy and VonZuckerstein (1982) recommended that rental housing energy conservation programs could effectively be designed by tailoring landlord incentives based on their profit motivations, results from this study indicate that such a classification strategy may not be as useful as would be one based on the scale of an owner's rental property operations.",1992-09,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,815,,9,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even so, wide variations in energy consumption are still observed between similar dwellings and between actual and predicted levels. It is thought that these variations stem from differences in occupant behaviour, the structural quality of the building, and a rebound effect. This paper statistically examines differences in occupant behaviour in relation to the building characteristics of the housing stock in the Netherlands and explores the possible existence of a rebound effect on the consumption of energy for space heating. Rebound effect can be defined as the increase on energy consumption in services for which improvements in energy efficiency reduce the costs. We found that although energy consumption is lower in energy efficient dwellings, analysis of the behaviour variables indicates their occupants tend to prefer higher indoor temperatures and to ventilate less. This finding might be related to a rebound effect on occupant behaviour. However, the improvement of thermal properties and systems efficiency still lead to a reduction on energy consumption for heating.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",2013-06,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,311,,2,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This calls for Demand Side Management solutions propelling change in behaviors of end consumers, with the aim to reduce overall consumption as well as shift it to periods in which demand is lower and where the cost of generating energy is lower. Demand Side Management solutions require detailed knowledge about the patterns of energy consumption. The profile of electricity demand in the residential sector is highly correlated with the time of active occupancy of the dwellings; therefore in this study the occupancy patterns in Spanish properties was determined using the 2009-2010 Time Use Survey (TUS), conducted by the National Statistical Institute of Spain. The survey identifies three peaks in active occupancy, which coincide with morning, noon and evening. This information has been used to input into a stochastic model which generates active occupancy profiles of dwellings, with the aim to simulate domestic electricity consumption. TUS data were also used to identify which appliance-related activities could be considered for Demand Side Management solutions during the three peaks of occupancy.

Despite the potential of free-ridership to seriously undermine the economic efficiency of a program intervention, for instance to foster energy efficiency, the issue remains largely absent from contemporary environmental and energy policy discussions in Europe. One reason for this neglect is the inherent difficulty of assessing which households would have undertaken the energy conservation activity even without the program. This paper proposes a procedure to calculate the free-rider share using revealed preference data on home renovations from Germany's residential sector. We employ a discrete-choice model to analyze the effect of grants on renovation choices, the output from which is used to assess the extent of free-ridership under a subsidy program very akin to an implemented grants program in Germany. Our empirical results suggest only very moderate energy savings induced by the program, making free-riding a problem of outstanding importance.

In doing so, we incorporated OIs in the theory of planned behavior model, and included employees' energy-saving knowledge and educational level as moderators. We found that (1) OIs improved employees' energy-saving attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, and they strengthened employees' intention to engage in energy-saving behaviors; (2) conveying expectations regarding energy-saving behaviors to employees worked better than emphasizing the importance of such behaviors; (3) increasing employees' knowledge of energy consumption may have strengthened the positive effect of OIs on employees' attitudes and perceived behavioral control in this context; and (4) the positive effect of OIs on the perceived behavioral control of employees with high and low educational level was greater than that on those with moderate educational level.

Amongst the range of environmental sustainability issues arising from housing construction and occupation, the energy demand for heating and/or cooling to maintain thermal comfort has the longest history and is most widespread in policy and regulation. Since energy in our homes is mainly fossil-derived, a key issue is global climate change impacts. Since greenhouse gas emissions can be emitted in various locations across the globe with similar results, it follows that a given greenhouse gas emission arising from residential space heating and cooling has approximately equal impact, irrespective of the location of the building. These emissions are therefore an appropriate candidate for benchmarking internationally, yet there have been few attempts to undertake this activity. This paper reports on a study undertaken in Australia which compares the thermal energy performance of housing in the United States, Canada, UK and Australia. The comparison is based on energy ratings of over 50 house designs from the comparison countries. Each design was assessed as being current and verified as complying with rather than significantly exceeding local regulatory requirements. Issues in design of both the buildings and the modelling tool used are highlighted, and the results are presented. Conclusions are drawn on the reasons for wide variations in thermal energy performance, the implications for benchmarking, and the case for globally consistent housing environmental performance policies and regulation.

Given consumers' limited experience in residential buildings and the perceived uncertainty about their comfort benefits and resulting energy savings, these relatively new technologies might be undervalued by risk-averse consumers. Using the concept of certainty-equivalence, this paper proposes a model to assess the consumers' risk-aversion for adopting energy-efficient systems. These systems are treated as risky assets while conventional commodities are assumed to be risk-free. The curvature of the utility function is interpreted as a measure of aversion to perceived risks as opposed to explicit risks measured by observed variances. The proposed formulation is applicable in stated preference data with qualitative variables. The model is applied to data from a choice experiment conducted among 264 apartment tenants in Switzerland. The estimated curvatures reject the risk-neutrality hypothesis. The range of the estimated risk premiums suggests that risk considerations remain a central issue in dealing with energy efficiency in residential buildings. The analysis also indicates that assuming same risk attitudes toward new and conventional systems could bias the estimates of the willingness to pay, especially when the system is comprised of several components.

This article incorporates housing policy debate into energy policy, hoping to provide new opportunities for planners to participate in residential energy policy. Using data from the latest Residential Energy Consumption Survey, structural equation modeling has been applied to isolate the direct and indirect effects of household and housing characteristics on residential energy use. Results show that more than 80% of a household's indirect effect on energy consumption happens through the building characteristics, which is characterized as the housing choice effect on energy consumption. Planners can participate in residential energy management efforts by influencing housing needs and priorities of communities towards more sustainable compact housing units.

However, other factors such as fuel prices, wages, attitudes and lifestyles also influence energy consumption. This paper calculates broad-brush rebound effects based on changes in energy efficiency and energy consumption in each of the 28 EU countries plus Norway, for the years 2000-2011. In doing so, it tests how well the assumption of energy efficiency leading to energy reduction stands up to scrutiny in these lands. It uses the EU's Odyssee database for efficiency and consumption figures and a commonly employed econometric definition of the rebound effect as an energy-efficiency elasticity. Most older EU lands show rebound effects in the expected range of 0-50%. However, the range for newer EU countries is 100-550%, suggesting that energy efficiency increases are not a good predictor of energy consumption. A more in-depth look at one country, Germany, suggests these results underestimate the rebound effect significantly. This also identifies research needs for specific energy consumption determinants in each country, to find more precisely what is driving consumption levels.",2014-10,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:52,,323,,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-one experts were interviewed, and a qualitative data analysis was applied to identify barriers, and relate them to key dimensions in the sectoral innovation system framework.

To address this, we propose a generic revolving fund model and apply it using data on the costs and benefits of domestic sector retrofit in the UK. We find that a revolving fund could reduce the costs of domestic sector retrofit in the UK by 26%, or L9 billion, whilst also making such a scheme cost-neutral, albeit with significant up-front investments that would only pay for themselves over an extended period of time.

The focus of this viewpoint is on how incentives for improving energy efficiency are affected by pricing principles in two specific areas: housing rents and district heating fees. Many countries have regulations that affect how housing rent is determined. It has been shown that cost-based rents reduce incentives for energy efficiency. The same may occur if rent is related to qualities of the apartment, if these qualities do not include the indoor climate. There have been concerns that district heating companies might respond to lower sales by increasing prices, thus reducing any incentive to reduce energy consumption. It is argued that this will not happen if fixed and variable fees correctly reflect the cost structure. Empirical studies show that it is common to have a variable fee that is higher than the marginal cost, partly because of monopoly elements in the market. This type of pricing will actually strengthen the incentives for energy efficiency investments compared to theoretically correct pricing principles.

In a counter-intuitive way, the model highlights that subsidies for renovations with minor energy gains worsen the overall energy consumption of housing due to the inducement of lock-ins with energy inefficient houses. Structural changes are needed in the use of policy instruments. First, commonly applied support schemes for renovations with minor energy savings should be abolished. Second, scarce public resources should incentivize deep renovation and demolition and reconstruction. Finally, taxes should apply on the use of virgin land to persuade households with a high willingness to pay for a new house, to invest in demolition and reconstruction.",2015-11,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,697,,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have shown that sustainable buildings command a rent premium compared to comparable conventional buildings. Lower operating expenses are expected to be a major source of the rent premium that sustainable buildings command. This is especially the case for buildings with triple-net leases, where tenants directly benefit from savings in operating costs. For a large dataset of U.S. office buildings this study finds significantly lower operating expenses in LEED certified buildings. However, savings in operating expenses only explain part of the rent premium. Additional factors must be at work. Surprisingly, we find significantly higher operating expenses in Energy Star rated buildings. Hence, intangible benefits appear to be the major source of rental premiums of Energy Star rated buildings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]",2014-10,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,413,,3,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study is twofold. First, I aim to provide initial empirical evidence of the extent to which split incentives between landlords and tenants may lead to underinvestment. Second, I investigate the influence of tax credits and energy burdens on energy efficiency expenditures. Given the complexity of studying the decision to invest in energy-saving renovations, I use a bivariate Tobit model to compare decisions about energy-efficient works and repair works, even when the renovation expenditures seem quite similar. The analysis shows that tenants are doubly penalized: they have high energy expenditures due to energy-inefficient building characteristics, and because they are poorer than homeowners, they are unable to invest in energy-saving systems. The results also confirm that tax credits are ineffective in the split incentives context. In terms of public policy, the government should focus on low-income tenants, and mandatory measures such as minimum standards seem appropriate. Financial support from a third-party financer also might be a solution.

The European Union and the United States aim ZEBs implementation to address 'peak oil' and environmental concerns. However, literature shows no agreement on a consensual definition of ZEB. Seeking a Brazilian ZEB definition, this paper addresses PassivHaus and thermal comfort standards for hot climates, source metrics for ZEB, Brazil's energy mix, residential energy end uses and Brazilian legal framework for residential photovoltaic (PV) generation. Internal Rate of Return for PV systems in two Brazilian cities is calculated under various scenarios. It shows grid parity was reached from April 2012 to November 2012 assuming residential electric tariffs of that period and the financial conditions given by the Brazilian government for the construction of new dams in the Amazon and the lowest rates offered by Brazilian banks to private individuals. Governmental decision to lower electric residential tariffs in November 2012 reduced the scope of grid parity. Later revocation of a tax exemption in April 2013 ended grid parity in Brazil. It concludes, conversely to developed countries, it is the volatile Brazilian energy policy, instead of economical barriers, the main obstacle for ZEB viability in Brazil.

Similarly, market transformation (MT) has a long history in product markets, improving the energy efficiency of stocks of energy-using appliances through research, minimum standards, energy labels, incentives, procurement, competitions, and stakeholder networks. Attempts to apply MT to buildings have failed to fully take account of the differences between appliance markets and the multiple markets which frame energy use in buildings. The case of refurbishment of UK housing is considered here, for which there is a system of different markets in operation. MT principles are considered in relation to the sources and diffusion of innovation in project-based industries; the management of different expectations among innovators and incumbents; technical risks associated with doing low-carbon refurbishment work; and the role of policy in simultaneously stimulating supply and demand. An iterative process with feedback loops and coordination is proposed to link training, standard-setting, and compliance checks. No institutional infrastructure exists for such an enterprise, which would need to cross established boundaries between regime actors. The case of UK housing refurbishment throws up lessons for theory, research, and practice which could be developed through further case studies.

The reliance on simple metrics, such as Energy Use Intensity (EUI), fails to account for significant variation across occupancy, construction characteristics and other elements of a building - both its design and its users - that influence building energy consumption. Using a unique dataset of actual building energy use, physical, spatial, and occupancy characteristics - collected from New York City's Local Law 84 energy disclosure database, the Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) database, and the CoStar Group - this paper analyzes energy consumption across commercial office buildings and presents a new methodology for a market-specific benchmarking model to measure relative energy performance across peer buildings.

Consequently, atmospheric emissions are greater than necessary. Government funded schemes have been introduced to incentivise the uptake of thermal retrofit measures in the domestic Irish market. A study of Ireland's housing highlights the dominance of detached houses (43%), 72% of which are rurally located and are predominantly heated with fuel oil. This paper investigates the economic and carbon case for thermal retrofit measures to the existing detached, oil centrally heated, rural housing stock. The study found the case for energy efficiency measures to be categorical and supports the Irish Government's focus on energy efficiency policy measures. Thermal retrofit measures in the detached housing stock have the potential to realise an averaged 65% theoretical reduction in heating costs and CO2 emissions for houses constructed prior to 1979 (coinciding with the introduction of building regulations) and around 26% for newer homes, thus offering a significant contribution (44%) to Ireland's residential carbon abatement projections and hence in meeting the EU's directives on energy and carbon. The greatest savings (36%) of Ireland's carbon abatement projections result from improving the energy efficiency of the pre 1979 stock.

Energy code adoption typically results in an increase in aggregate social welfare by cost effectively reducing energy expenditures. Using a Cox proportional hazards model, I test if relative state funding, a new, objective, multivariate regression-derived measure of government capacity, as well as a vector of control variables commonly used in comparative state research, predict commercial building energy code adoption. The research shows little political influence over historical commercial building energy code adoption in the sample. Colder climates and higher electricity prices also do not predict more frequent code adoptions. I do find evidence of high government capacity states being 60 percent more likely than low capacity states to adopt commercial building energy codes in the following year. Wealthier states are also more likely to adopt commercial codes. Policy recommendations to increase building code adoption include increasing access to low cost capital for the private sector and providing noncompetitive block grants to the states from the federal government.

Most of the existing researches utilized time series data to investigate the driving factors of the industry's CO2 emission at the national level, but regional differences have not been given appropriate attention. This paper adopts provincial panel data from 2000 to 2013 and panel data models to examine the key driving forces of CO2 emissions at the regional levels in China. The results show that industrialization dominates the industry's CO2 emissions, but its effect varies across regions. The impact of energy efficiency on CO2 emissions in the eastern region is greater than in the central and western regions because of a huge difference in RD investment. The influence of urbanization has significant regional differences due to the heterogeneity in human capital accumulation and real estate development. Energy structure has large potential to mitigate CO2 emissions on account of increased RD investment in energy-saving technology and expanded clean energy use. Hence, in order to effectively achieve emission reduction, local governments should consider all these factors as well as regional heterogeneity in formulating appropriate mitigation policies.

The results disproved this assumption and demonstrated that sustainable building can be financially profitable. However, the research also showed that these positive financial aspects are hardly ever used to promote sustainable building. SenterNovem initiated a new research project in order to recommend practical solutions for the identified issues. Besides the sustainable and 'regular' building sectors, the new project included other sectors in an effort to develop new insights. Focused on housing, this second project revealed the inevitability of a labeling system that covers all activities ('one language'). It recommends giving top priority to the introduction of a labeling system that translates sustainability in housing into a manageable and controllable system. The system should clearly identify the level of sustainability of a specific house. To gain acceptance among consumers, the system would have to tie in with consumer needs. The idea that many financial incentives can be linked to this labeling system was affirmed in a separate workshop. Just before the second research project was completed, the Dutch housing corporation Oost Flevoland Woondiensten (OFW) introduced a labeling system for their entire stock related to the topics of energy and health. Nine months after the launch, an assessment of this labeling system confirmed the results of the theoretical research and the workshop.

They describe the innovation process in terms of the distinct domains of knowledge that producers and users possess. Producers have knowledge about technical solutions and users about their needs, the context of use, and their own capabilities as users. Both sets of knowledge are characterized by stickiness: They move relatively freely within their own domain but are difficult to transfer outside of it. In the case of radical innovations for sustainable consumption, the problem of sticky information is compounded. Both producers and consumers need to reach out of their conventional competencies and search for new solutions. Societal actors, such as government bodies or environmental experts, can show the way to such solutions, but this new knowledge needs to be integrated with the sticky knowledge about everyday practices in production and consumption. In the present article we attempt to conceptualize the role and interaction of user and producer knowledge with the knowledge of environmental experts in housing energy innovations. We do so by applying the user-producer interaction framework to a case study on the introduction of low-energy housing concepts in Finland. On the basis of this analysis, we draw conclusions on the potential and limitations of today's practices in the field. For example, we suggest that user involvement can help to enhance the acceptance of low-energy solutions but that the methods for involving users need to be adapted to the particular circumstances in each industry.",2010-02,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reports on a recently completed empirical study for the Swiss residential sector. It empirically quantifies the marginal costs of energy efficiency investments (i.e. additional insulation, improved window systems, ventilation and heating systems and architectural concepts). For the private sector, first results on the economic valuation of co-benefits such as improved comfort of living, improved indoor air quality, better protection against external noise, etc. may amount to the same order of magnitude as the energy-related benefits are given. The costbenefit analysis includes newly developed technologies that show large variations in prices due to pioneer market pricing, add-on of learning costs and risk components of the installers. Based on new empirical data on the present cost-situation and past techno-economic progress, the potential of future cost reduction was estimated applying the experience curve concept.

China is now pumping more than 6 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere each year, to say nothing of the sulfur dioxide and particulates that pose a major public health threat.

Whether there is a full compensating differential or how much households are paying implicitly is an empirical question. This study estimates the net implicit price of energy efficient buildings codes, IECC 2003 through IECC 2006, for American households. Using sample data from the American Community Survey 2007, a heteroskedastic seemingly unrelated estimation approach is used to estimate hedonic price (house rent) and energy expenditure models. The value of energy efficiency building codes is capitalized into housing rents, which are estimated to increase by 23.25 percent with the codes. However, the codes provide households a compensating differential of about a 6.47 percent reduction (about $7.71) in monthly energy expenditure. Results indicate that the mean household net implicit price for these codes is about $140.87 per month in 2006 dollars ($163.19 in 2013 dollars). However, this estimated price is shown to vary significantly by region, energy type and the rent gradient.

This paper explores to what extent some of these theoretical advantages are realised in two collaborative housing units in a major Swedish city. Food-related energy use and waste flows were measured and compared with results from food service institutions and some data relevant for households. Results show that energy use for cooking decreases in collaborative houses compared with households but energy use for food storage increases. Plate and food preparation wastes are low in the studied collaborative houses but food leftovers may be abundant. The latter result depends on how the dining system is organised. A bottleneck for improving the environmental efficiency in collaborative housing is the static view of apartment design held by many architects and real estate owners. Another bottleneck may be the unwillingness of households to make advance commitments to daily dining.

However, implementing green technologies usually requires more investment than using traditional technologies and the payback period tends to be very long. In China, most developers sell their properties and subsequently transfer the ownership to customers. Hence, a crucial problem for promoting green construction is that developers cannot obtain economic profits (“gold”) from implementing “green” technologies. Meanwhile, other stakeholders, such as property management companies, are also hesitant to adopt green technologies because of the large investment involved and their lack of experience. To tackle this problem, an energy performance contracting (EPC) based framework is proposed, to turn “green” investment into “gold” benefit by careful sharing of the risks existed. The framework was developed by conducting a focus group meeting with three experienced representatives from developer, property management company and energy service company respectively. A real-life case study, which includes both energy efficient system retrofit and new construction, is used to estimate the costs and benefits involved to demonstrate and verify the conceptual framework. The results show that the proposed framework can support the application of green technologies in both types of projects. Economic benefits as well as environmental benefits can be gained for the project stakeholders and the whole society.

This trend has lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty but it has also sharply increased local, regional, and global pollution levels. We look at the rise in air pollution over recent decades, and the perhaps surprising finding that in many of China's urban areas, levels of particulates (of less than 10 microns) have been decreasing during the last 10 to 15 years. We then turn to the costs and tradeoffs of air pollution, including costs to human health, reductions in worker productivity, and how people are seeking to reduce their exposure to pollution as shown by compensating differentials in real estate prices and purchases of masks and air filters. We discuss how rising incomes tend to raise the demand for environmental amenities and thus increase political pressure for environmental protection, and then we turn to the policy tools that China has used to reduce pollution. We conclude by arguing that as China's government is preparing for an additional 300 million people to move to urban areas over the next 30 years, it will have a number of opportunities for China to reduce pollution through a shift from manufacturing to services, along with various steps to improve energy efficiency and resource conservation. Overall, it seems that China is on track to improve its environmental performance in the years ahead.

This paper provides a background on carbon markets and their potential role in a proposed strategy for energy efficiency improvements (EEI). It compares the relationship between an investment decision based solely on electricity prices to one that incorporates the monetary benefit associated with carbon offsets. The findings suggest that a regulated carbon 'cap and trade' system could provide additional value to property owners who pursue EEI strategies. Moreover, carbon offset value differs significantly by geographic location and method by which electrical energy is produced. EEI strategies that take into account carbon offset value could significantly reduce the impact that commercial real estate has on the environment.",2010,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,67-90,,1,2,,Journal of Sustainable Real Estate,,,,,,,,,,,EconLit,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,"Nonagricultural and Nonresidential Real Estate Markets R33; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41; Biodiversity Conservation; Bioeconomics; Capacity D24; Capital; Capital, Total Factor, and Multifactor Productivity; Cost; Ecological Economics: Ecosystem Services; Industrial Ecology Q57; Production; Regional Economic Activity: Growth, Development, Environmental Issues, and Changes R11",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The scenarios vary outcomes associated with allocations to local distribution companies, investments in electricity energy efficiency and technology development. We introduce a third scenario that allocates a substantial portion of allowance value directly to households. We find the average consumer surplus loss per household in 2016 in the optimistic scenario to be $136 and the allowance price is as low as $13.20 per ton. In the pessimistic scenario, the consumer surplus loss rises to $413, with an allowance price of $23.43 per ton.

Within the conducted research, an analysis of existing approaches to managing project costs in the face of uncertainty was carried out, including the justification of the possibility of using the contract system for the purpose of optimizing the project, as well as identification of possibilities of cost engineering. Design/methodology/approach: A Case-study method, based on an assessment of the performance indicators of an investment project for the construction of a city boiler house and the project cost analysis using the Earned Value Technique, was used to prove the hypothesis about the effectiveness of using cost engineering. Findings: The results of evaluating the effectiveness of project implementation was substantiated, and the feasibility of applying the EPC contract for the cost optimization was proven. The projects implemented with the EPC contracts have a high potential. EPC/M contracts are widely used in other countries, but in Russia, this type of contract is just beginning to be used. Originality/value: In the result of the analysis, it was revealed that the main factors affecting the cost of the boiler house implementation construction project were the imperfection of the pricing system, the presence of unrecorded work and costs, the inadequacy of the rationing system; the violation of technology and timing of implementation.

The three packages of interventions that improve the thermal performance of the houses (ceilings, roof and wall insulation, windows and partitions) were found to be economically attractive both from a national and a household perspective. The net benefits from the whole package for a standard RDP home is about 10 per cent of the value of the housing subsidy provided by the government. The same interventions applied to informal housing appear more costly because the lifespan of shacks is taken to be five years. Row houses are particularly attractive, although their social acceptability requires further study. Compact fluorescent lamps and solar water heating are also attractive because of the energy savings they deliver. Apart from saving money, all these measures improve the quality of life of households by increasing comfort and decreasing indoor air pollution. Although the measures have a net social benefit, it does not mean that poor people can afford them. Energy-efficiency measures tend to have high capital costs, while the benefits are spread over many years. With their high discount rates, consumers are often not able to wait for future savings, nor do they have access to capital for investment. Based on our analysis, however, a capital subsidy of between R1 000 and R2 000 (not the full capital cost) is all that would be required to make these measures attractive to poor households across a range of regions and income groups. The no-cost measures of northern orientations: climatically correct window size and placement, as well as the appropriate wall and roof colour have a thermal running cost and environmental impact.

But what effect does sustainability have on property market values? A lot of discussion and research has already been undertaken to analyze possible impacts of sustainable characteristics on property values. Until now, little significant quantitative empirical evidence has been found, and if so, it s usually related to US real estate markets and the sustainability certifications of LEED and Energy Star. In 2002, the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was adopted to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. The IMMOVALUE-project, granted by the program of Intelligent Energy Europe, analyzed the possibility of implementing characteristics of energy efficiency into property valuation practice using data from the mandatory energy-performance certificates. One result of the project was that if detailed property market data are available, multiple regression analysis in the framework of hedonic pricing models could be applied to consider, and empirically establish, the effects of energy efficiency characteristics on properties values. This article focuses on the possibility of integrating aspects of energy efficiency into income-related property valuation approaches.

In Germany a large share of the residential building stock is rented. This comes with barriers to energy efficiency retrofitting due to split incentive problems. Alongside existing government incentive programmes, the German tenancy law allows landlords to add a maximum of 11% of the energy-related modernisation costs onto the annual rent. Studies evaluating the actual outcomes, from an energy as well as a social point of view, are rare. This article compares calculated theoretical heating energy consumption for prior to and after retrofit with actual consumption data after retrofit. Further, the issue of household expenses is addressed by comparing increased rental costs after retrofit with household's energy expenses prior and after retrofit. Despite a reduction in energy consumption of 70%, more than half of the households faced increased costs due to higher rents after retrofit. Even when increases in energy prices are taken into account, still one third of the households faced higher costs. For a fairer and more effective distribution of costs and benefits, this article stresses the importance of alternative financing models. Highlights • Tenants often do not profit from energy efficiency retrofits in financial terms. • Households with low energy consumption are disproportionately affected. • Alternative financing models are needed for more efficient and fair retrofit policies.

The reform, aimed at encouraging energy efficiency and private investment, sparked considerable policy debate about its potential impact on household welfare. This paper estimates a short-run residential electricity demand function to evaluate the distributional impact of the tariff increase. The analysis allows heterogeneity in households' price sensitivity and the model is estimated using a nationally representative sample of 8,572 Turkish households. The results suggest that rich households in Turkey are three times as responsive in adjusting consumption to price changes as poor households are. In addition, the welfare loss of the poorest income quintile--measured by the change in consumer surplus as a percentage of income--is 2.9 times that of the wealthiest.

5LNHIVXA,thesis,2013,"Nasseri, Iman",Essays in Energy and Environmental Economics,,,,,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1470967&site=ehost-live,"This dissertation is comprised of three essays on energy and environmental economics. The first two essays of this dissertation examine sectoral energy consumption in the State of Hawai'i. My first essay focuses on the intermediate demand for energy consumption by economic sectors. I model Hawai'i's economy in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework and follow the footprint of efficiency improvement in the economy by looking at the energy flows in Hawai'i's economy. Assuming a ""free"" technological change becoming available to firms, this essay ranks the economic sectors with respect to their saving potential. While there are currently some energy efficiency rules and incentives in place, this essay provides insights to design alternative sector-specific energy efficiency policies that could help to achieve the State's goals. My results identify hotels, construction, accommodations, restaurants, and retail trade as the key sectors to be targeted for a successful sector-specific energy efficiency program. The above-mentioned sectors together comprise 56% of total potential reduction in energy use and GHG emissions in Hawai'i's economy. In the second essay, I turn my attention to final energy consumers, contributing toward the understanding of electricity and fuel use associated with residents and visitors of Hawai'i. Using an Input-Output model, I analyze the difference in total energy consumption--both direct purchases and indirect demand for energy through purchases of other goods and services--of residents and visitors. I run the same analysis using both 2007 and 1997 data set to compare the consumption pattern change over time. My results show that on a per-capita basis, residents tend to consume more electricity through spending on health services, real estate rentals, professional services, and trade, while top visitor electricity-intensive expenditures include hotel, restaurants, trade (shopping), and tourism services (museums, tours and travel agencies). The results for 1997 and 2007 show a remarkable difference between residents and visitors: while total demand for fuels and electricity increased by 18% and 33%, respectively, for residents, they both fell by 4% and 9%, respectively, for visitors. Adjusting for population change, per-capita results reveal the same pattern but different magnitudes. Therefore, I conclude that the tourism industry has improved efficiency in both fuel and electricity usages by decreasing energy intensity of their activities over the observed decade. During the observed 10-year period, energy-use visitor factor dropped for fuel from 3.5 to 2.5 (a 28% drop) and for electricity from 2.4 to 1.5 (a 38% drop). Finally, to assess the underlying driving forces influencing the observed changes in energy consumption in Hawai'i, I used a decomposition methodology to explain the changes in sectoral energy demand between 1997 and 2007 in terms of activity, structure, and intensity effects. The findings indicate that the activity effect contributed greatly to the observed growth in energy consumption, that the structural effect was small, and that the reduction in energy intensity by sector was a clear signal of improvement in energy efficiency. Finally, in my third essay, I look into the controversial topic of climate policy under uncertainty. The literature on hybrid climate policy could be divided in two groups: studies of one group discuss the welfare-enhancing features of hybrid policies in a qualitative framework, while the others compare the policies by measuring welfare loss in a stochastic dynamic setting. My third essay seeks to contribute to the literature by providing a theoretical welfare analysis for optimal hybrid policy under uncertainty. Moreover, I contribute to the U.S. climate policy literature using a numerical example. In this essay, I bypass the conventional price and quantity mechanisms and focus on the two common hybrid policies: Two-Step Carbon Tax as a price-driven mechanism, and Cap-and-Trade with Allowance Reserve, as a quantity-driven mechanism. I first solve for the optimal policy parameters in the context of climate change and then set the model's parameters to U.S.-specific values to quantify the solutions and compare them with respect to their expected welfare loss. The numerical analysis ranks the two-step tax policy above the cap-and-trade with allowance reserve in terms of social welfare loss, given the same cost and uncertainty parameters.",2013-12,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Hawaii at Manoa,,,,,EconLit,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,Climate; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Electric Utilities L94; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Computable and Other Applied General Equilibrium Models D58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITDZZPU6,thesis,2013,"Spurlock, Cecily Anna",Essays in Energy Economics,,,,,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1404934&site=ehost-live,"In this dissertation I explore two aspects of the economics of energy. The first focuses on consumer behavior, while the second focuses on market structure and firm behavior. In the first chapter, I demonstrate evidence of loss aversion in the behavior of households on two critical peak pricing experimental tariffs while participating in the California Statewide Pricing Pilot. I develop a model of loss aversion over electricity expenditure from which I derive two sets of test able predictions. First, I show that when there is a higher probability that a household is in the loss domain of their value function for the bill period, the more strongly they cut back peak consumption. Second, when prices are such that households are close to the kink in their value function--and would otherwise have expenditure skewed into the loss domain--I show evidence of disproportionate clustering at the kink. In essence this means that the occurrence of critical peak days did not only result in a reduction of peak consumption on that day, but also spilled over to further reduction of peak consumption on regular peak days for several weeks thereafter. This was similarly true when temperatures were high during high priced periods. This form of demand adjustment resulted in households experiencing bill-period expenditures equal to what they would have paid on the standard non-dynamic pricing tariff at a disproportionate rate. This higher number of bill periods with equal expenditure displaced bill periods in which they otherwise would have paid more than if they were on standard pricing. In the second chapter, I explore the effects of two simultaneous changes in minimum energy efficiency and Energy Star standards for clothes washers. Adapting the Mussa and Rosen (1978) and Ronnen (1991) second-degree price discrimination model, I demonstrate that clothes washer prices and menus adjusted to the new standards in patterns consistent with a market in which firms had been price discriminating. In particular, I show evidence of discontinuous price drops at the time the standards were imposed, driven largely by mid-low efficiency segments of the market. The price discrimination model predicts this result. On the other hand, under perfect competition, prices should increase for these market segments. Additionally, new models proliferated in the highest efficiency market segment following the standard changes. Finally, I show that firms appeared to use different adaptation strategies at the two instances of the standards changing.",2013-05,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of California, Berkeley",,,,,EconLit,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,Appliances; Energy: Demand and Supply; Furniture; Other Consumer Durables L68; Prices Q41; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Electric Utilities L94; Industry Studies: Utilities and Transportation: Government Policy L98; Oligopoly and Other Imperfect Markets L13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NTGP4VQC,thesis,2014,"Leard, Benjamin",Essays in Environmental and Energy Economics,,,,,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ecn&AN=1537393&site=ehost-live,"This dissertation is composed of four chapters. The first chapter provides an overview of my dissertation and summarizes the key results of the proceeding chapters. The second chapter, which I title ""Consumer Heterogeneity and the Energy Paradox,"" analyzes how households value energy efficiency when they buy a new car. The third chapter, titled ""Designing Efficient Markets for Carbon Offsets with Distributional Constraints,"" studies the relative efficacy of three policies--baselines, trade ratios and limits--for alleviating the problem of adverse selection in markets for carbon offsets. The forth chapter, currently titled ""On the Importance of Baseline Setting in Markets for Carbon Offsets,"" evaluates the relative magnitudes of over-credited, non-additional offsets and under-credited emissions reductions. The second chapter presents an analysis of the energy paradox with a focus on how consumers vary in their preferences for energy cost savings. By formulating a mixed logit discrete choice model of new vehicle demand that accounts for unobserved product characteristics, I estimate the distribution of household willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reducing gasoline costs by one dollar. While I find that the average household puts equal weight on vehicle price and fuel cost, I find significant heterogeneity in WTP where a non-trivial fraction of households appear to be inattentive to fuel cost differences. Encouraging these households to fully value fuel costs generates welfare gains that are on the same order of magnitude as the cost of increasing fuel economy standards. By calibrating a simple model of the new vehicle market, I find, however, that existing policies for increasing fuel economy fall short of realizing these gains because the policies influence the purchase decisions of all households, including those that fully or overvalue fuel costs. The third chapter presents an assessment of the relative efficacy of three key instruments--baselines, trade ratios and limits--which are under policy discussion in the design of carbon offset programs. We rank the instruments by their implications for total emissions, economic efficiency, and efficiency gain relative to a distributional transfer from capped to uncapped sectors. We find that the baseline is the best instrument for maximizing welfare as it directly reduces the share of offsets that are non-additional and that second-best policies do not sacrifice much welfare relative to the standard first-best policy prescription. In the fourth chapter, I develop a unified framework that considers the supply of offsets within a cap-and-trade program that allows us to compare of the relative impact of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions on overall emissions under different levels of baseline stringency and carbon prices. I find that the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets can be fully balanced out by under-credited emissions reductions without sacrificing a significant portion of the overall supply of offsets, provided emissions baselines are stringent enough. Under a medium-run reduction target of two billion tons of CO2 equivalent, to maintain the environmental integrity of the program, baselines need to be set to 70 percent of predicted business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. Moreover, as the carbon market achieves higher equilibrium prices, less stringent baselines can balance out the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions.",2014-08,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cornell University,,,,,EconLit,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,Energy: General Q40; Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12; Asymmetric and Private Information; Mechanism Design D82; Environmental Economics: General Q50; Automobiles; Other Transportation Equipment; Related Parts and Equipment L62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this manuscript we use a household survey from 387 households in rural Kenya to model source choice and water demand using a discrete-continuous (linked) demand model. We find that households are sensitive to the price, proximity, taste, and availability in choosing among sources, but are not sensitive to other source qualities including color, health risk, and risk of conflict. We use the linked demand framework to estimate own-price elasticities in the rural setting. These range between -0.13 and -1.33, with a mean of -0.56, consistent with other estimates from small and large cities. Manuscript 2 is titled, ""Energy efficiency information asymmetries in the rental housing market"", and is a solo work. In this manuscript I exploit the variation in payment-status (who pays the energy bill), to estimate the effect of information asymmetries on the adoption of efficient (Energy Star rated) technologies in the U.S. rental housing market. Results show that, contrary to previous findings, landlords who pay their tenant's energy bill are no more likely to install energy efficient technologies, suggesting that information asymmetries play a nominal role in the adoption of efficient technologies in the rental housing market. Manuscript 3 is titled, ""A linked-demand model to characterize multiple discrete-continuous demand"", and is coauthored with Joseph Cook. In this manuscript we develop a reduced form multiple discrete-continuous demand model. Using this model we analyze weekly household demand for water in rural Ethiopia, and characterize four important aspects of demand: (1) total household water demand, (2) source-specific household demand, (3) aggregate water demand at each source, and (4) household preferences across source attributes. Results show that households value water quality, proximity and price in choosing which sources to collect from. Average own-price elasticity estimates from the aggregate demand analysis are found to be -0.18, and are consistent with other own-price elasticity estimates from middle- and low-income countries.",2020-05,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,Washington State University,,,,,EconLit,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,"Housing; Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12; Asymmetric and Private Information; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Mechanism Design D82; Microeconomic Analyses of Economic Development O12; Economic Development: Urban, Rural, Regional, and Transportation Analysis; Infrastructure O18; Renewable Resources and Conservation: Water Q25",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Chapter 2, the study examines the price premium from Korea's Energy Efficiency Grade Label. The Korean government recently began energy certification of televisions, providing a setting to analyze a possible price effect of the new label. Hedonic regression results seem to show that a price premium exists for products with the Energy Efficiency Grade Label. However, potential unobserved heterogeneity is a concern. Difference-in-difference and fixed-effects models are used to capture the net effect of the label by controlling for time and product differences. The results suggest that any price premium does not result from the energy efficiency label itself. Instead, energy-efficient products already had higher prices before the introduction of the energy efficiency label. The finding turns our attention to the importance of careful design of labeling programs. In Chapter 3, using the publicly available housing transaction data in Korea, the study estimates a fixed-effects model to examine the impact of industrial park openings on the housing market in Korea. This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, the availability of multiple transactions within apartment complexes makes it feasible to carry out a fixed-effects estimation and address unobserved heterogeneity across apartment complexes. Second, I trace the effect on housing values from the announcement stage to actual operation stage of industrial parks. Third, although most previous studies analyze U.S. housing market, I examine the Korean housing market. I find that people in general have positive expectations about parks opening at the time of announcement, but they do not want to be located in close proximity to the park. Furthermore, the housing price effects of announcement and actual start of operation differ. Local households react positively to the news of industrial park openings and remain positive by the time parks begin operation, but households in close proximity to industrial parks react relatively less positively at the time of announcement, and the decline in price premium becomes greater once parks begin operation. In Chapter 4, I examine the price effect of the Fukushima nuclear accident on the Korean housing market. The Fukushima nuclear disaster triggered by the earthquake and tsunami was an unfortunate accident that is recorded as the worst nuclear accident since the Chernobyl accident. Given the proximity of South Korea to Japan, Koreans were particularly more concerned about the severity of the accident and its environmental and health impacts. Uncertain events such as the Fukushima nuclear accident may cause households to re-evaluate the likelihood of environmental hazard and decrease the values of housing units that are located near the facilities. Current study analyzes how the Korean housing market responds to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, using publicly available housing transactions data. The study compares the prices of apartments located in the nuclear plant-possessing districts with those of the apartments located in adjacent districts. The results indicate that in reaction to the news of disaster in Japan, housing prices decreased radically in those districts with nuclear power plants.",2017-10,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rutgers University,,,,,EconLit,,EBSCOhost,,Ph.D.,,,,Energy: Government Policy Q48; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Alternative Energy Sources Q42; Electric Utilities L94; Consumer Protection D18; Other Spatial Production and Pricing Analysis R32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a conceptual phase, people in Romania (inclusively investors in real estate) have shown, both as consumers and as society, an interest for green buildings, and so this is a big opportunity for real estate developers to extend their businesses. Our paper is focusing on what represents demand and offer in Romanian green buildings market.

In conclusion, this paper highlights benefits of green buildings, in terms of reducing costs but also in terms of sustainability of the building.

Green housing development requires a complex socio-technical transition based not just on green materials or technologies, but also, and most importantly, on the behavioural transition of housing market actors. Little is known about how Chinese real estate enterprises are responding to the green housing transition within a Chinese context. Addressing this gap, our research aims to determine whether, and to what, extent Chinese real estate enterprises are transitioning toward greener housing practices and what constraints may exist. This research gap is particularly pressing given the Chinese government's ambitions to promote energy efficiency in the new urban building sector by requiring 50% of urban new buildings to be green buildings by 2020 (NDRC, 2016). Our research reveals Chinese real estate enterprises face a dilemma of 'going green' and a range of institutional constraints that currently frustrate their uptake of green housing practices. Our research furthers knowledge on environmental and housing market governance within non-western and non-liberal contexts. • A stylised representation of the housing market as a specific institutional ensemble is depicted. • A range of institutional constraints to the green housing transition were identified. • Real estate enterprises face a dilemma of 'going green'. • A clear policy pathway should guide future market action to ensure long-term institutional change.

The general purpose is to encourage the production of thermal energy and domestic hot water through the use of renewable energy sources. This is part of the EU's long-term objective of decarbonising the existing and inefficient European real estate park. In order to start renovating the existing buildings on the national territory, considerable financial resources are needed which the owners should have. The Romanian state, through the Agency for Environmental Protection, comes to the support the interested persons by granting financial support within the ""Green House"" Programs.

Design/methodology/approach – The tool consists of a system dynamic model that allows describing and quantifying the complex interaction between potential maintenance scenarios, external energy factors and case-specific conditions. In addition, to include the uncertainty of some of the input variables related to the external energy factors, Monte Carlo simulation has been applied. Findings – A case study of a city hall in The Netherlands showed the usability of the proposed tool. Over the selected period of 20 years, applying the chosen set of interventions, the simulation showed possible gains in the net present value and significant decrease of energy consumption and carbon emission. Municipal officials and consultants verified the tool for energy efficiency. Research limitations/implications – Although the tool has proved its functionality in one case study, to test its robustness, additional case studies would be preferable. Practical implications – The assessment tool can help organizations in assessing energy-efficient maintenance scenarios that include multiple technical energy efficiency interventions as a part of other maintenance activities. Originality/value – There are numerous ways to increase building’s energy efficiency, but a lack of knowledge is often hindering the enhancement of maximal benefits. A tool that would assess both financial and environmental benefits of potential technical intervention would provide useful insights into corporate’s real estate current and possible future energy performance. This would aid corporations in making better decisions regarding finances, and on the long run, it will bring an improved corporate image.

Even when a certificate is available, landlords do not always disclose it. This contradicts the unraveling result, according to which all landlords should disclose quality information unless it is costly to do so. We leverage a cross-sectional dataset of residential rental advertisements from the Belgian region of Brussels to empirically evaluate incentives to disclose an EPC. We find that two fundamental assumptions for the unraveling result are not confirmed in our setting: tenants value energy performance of rental property only when dwellings are of very high quality and do not appear to rationally adjust their expectations when faced with dwellings that withhold their EPC.

Mild climate, deindustrialization, and its demographics explain part of this differential. California energy efficiency policy is often claimed to be another key factor. A challenge in judging this claim is the heterogeneity of the real estate capital stock. Residential homes differ along a large number of physical attributes. We access a proprietary dataset from a large hotel chain that allows us to evaluate the environmental performance of comparable commercial real estate across the United States. Controlling for climate conditions and geographic location, we document that California's commercial real estate stock is the most energy efficient at a point in time but this differential is quantitatively small.

These home listings include information on Energy Star certification and, in Portland and Austin, local green certifications. Our results suggest that Energy Star certification increases the sales prices of homes built between 1995 and 2006 but has no statistically significant effect on sales prices for newer homes. The local certifications appear to have larger effects on sales prices, and that effect holds for both newer and older homes. The estimated home price premiums from certification imply annual energy cost savings that are sizeable fractions of estimated annual energy costs for homes in our sample, in some cases even above 100 percent. This suggests that the certifications either embody other attributes beyond energy efficiency that are of value to homebuyers or that buyers are overpaying for the energy savings.

Using a novel dataset, we analyse over 5 million residential property sale transactions in England and Wales, each containing information about sale price, property and location characteristics, and a mandatory energy performance certificate (EPC). The EPC includes a continuous energy cost rating (SAP rating) which is mapped into seven colour-coded rating bands (ranging from green A to red G). Applying a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), we document significant price discontinuities at the rating band thresholds. We estimate that--holding the underlying SAP score equal--being in a higher rating band increases the final sale price of a property between 0.8% and 2.5% ($2,000 and $6,625 based on average sale prices) depending on the threshold crossed. The presence of price discontinuities suggests that individuals are attentive to the simpler colour-coded rating band and partially inattentive to the more precise SAP rating. We present a simple model for estimating the degree of inattention and show that, for a given level of attention, rating bands reduce attention to the SAP rating by 25% on average. Importantly, the detected price discontinuities appear to influence market behaviour: Sellers whose property receives an EPC rating just below a threshold to the next-higher rating band are between 0.4% and 11% more likely to make last-minute EE investments before placing their property on the market. We discuss a number of recommendations of how to best leverage these threshold effects to improve policy design, which can be extended to other settings where the provision of simplified information creates reference thresholds.",2020,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EconLit,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: CESifo, CESifo Working Paper Series: 8669",,,,"Learning; Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand R21; Belief; Communication; Information and Knowledge; Information and Product Quality; Search; Standardization and Compatibility L15; Unawareness D83",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Q5FSVH3G,journalArticle,2016,"Raggio, Randle D.; Ekman, Peter; Thompson, Steven",Marketing Energy Productivity: Implications from the Commercial Real Estate Sector in Sweden.,AMA Summer Educators' Conference Proceedings,,,,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=119995737&site=ehost-live,"Research Question Although energy consumption, conservation, and policy have emerged as significant social and governmental concerns, existing literature and recent interviews with commercial real estate firms and their tenants in Sweden and the U.S. reveal that--even among firms with a demonstrated concern for environmental issues--the primary driver of corporate action remains the bottom line. In the contest between ""sustainability"" and profit, profit always wins. While consumer attitudes have evolved, business still perceives goals of energy reduction to be at cross-purposes with financial performance. Is there a way to demonstrate the financial results of sustainability initiatives in a way that can demonstrate a positive impact on the bottom line? Instead of accepting the idea that firms must choose either profits or ""sustainability,"" we ask whether reframing the concepts of ""energy conservation"" or ""energy efficiency""-- which tend to be perceived as limited to energy reduction-- with the idea of energy productivity, conceptualized as output per unit of energy, will reveal a nexus of aligned interests that can bring industry, government, and society to the same side of the table. Method and Data We focus on energy use in the commercial real estate sector in Stockholm, Sweden. The starting-point for this study's data collection is the Green Fingerprint (GFP)--a software application ('app') that was developed by Mestro, a software development firm, in partnership with Humlegården Fastigheter AB (Humlegarden), a commercial real estate firm. The app allows commercial real estate tenants to see the real-time energy consumption of their leased space for electricity, heat, and cooling. Humlegarden is the leading commercial real estate firm in Sweden with respect to both its technology and brand positioning focused on sustainability. Humlegarden measures the energy use of 45 buildings housing approximately 1000 tenants via sensors on heating, cooling and electrical systems. Measurements are taken every 10-15 seconds, resulting in more than 7 million data points daily. We had access to over 50GB of GFP (operational, tenant) data collected by Humlegarden that covered pre- and post-Green Fingerprint implementation, and were in regular contact with representatives of these firms including tenant firms throughout the process as we collected data, developed our insights, and formulated our recommendations. Summary of Findings We demonstrate that attempts to improve energy conservation through existing measures such as Kilowatt-hours (kWh) per-square foot or kWh-per-employee, although easy to obtain, can be detrimental to the bottom line, as they may actually encourage wasteful practices. Further, they suffer quickly from diminishing returns, making them less influential over time. However, energy productivity, with even a simple operationalization of revenue per kWh, overcomes this problem and, like other useful metrics, focuses attention on the efficient use of resources under management control. Like existing productivity measures with which managers are familiar, such as revenue-per-employee, energy productivity is a concept that is both intuitive and attractive to those who wish to increase profits. At the same time, increasing energy productivity has environmental benefits. We demonstrate that tremendous brand and commercial value awaits the firm and/or industry that can effectively operationalize the concept of energy productivity and make it a part of its business model and brand positioning. Key Contributions This research makes three important contributions: (1) the application of the concept of energy productivity to corporate marketing, (2) a simple operationalization focused on managerial action, and (3) an empirical investigation with data from real firms. Our results suggest that while energy is consumed, monitored, and managed at the building level, relevant comparisons of results across organizations (e.g. , in the same industry) is critical. For example, guest-nights/kWh may be appropriate for hotels. Industry-level measures of energy productivity address the four issues identified in the extant research: (1) by treating energy as a controllable factor of production, it instills a cost focus on managers; (2) by providing a relevant metric across comparable firms, it provides relevant social norms, while (3) absolute and average industry values provide a benchmark against which all firms can compare themselves, providing a clear framework for goalsetting; and finally (4) measures of energy productivity can be reported on a monthly or quarterly basis aligned with other typical managerial reporting and do not suffer the same floor effects found with existing measures. Overall, we offer a clear demonstration of the possibilities for firms and government in order to provide a path forward for future policies, procedures and protocols.

We exploit variation in technologies that houses are locked into at construction time to identify the stand-alone value of having a cost-saving technology in the house. For the two main technologies, electric and district heating, the estimated price discount is 5-6% of the house value for electric heating, coming very close to the capitalized value of the cost differential obtained from external data on energy contract prices.

The CRC Scheme requires non-energy intensive organisations to measure and report on their energy consumption and purchase allowances for the amount of CO2 emissions associated with that consumption. The majority of the changes proposed will come into force from April 2014, however certain changes will come into effect from 1st June, 2013. Key changes for the real estate sector include the surprise abolition of the Performance League Table, the disapplication of the Landlord and Tenant Rule in respect of ground lease arrangements, and new rules in relation to CRC responsibility in Trust situations. The simplification of the CRC Scheme is to be welcomed as many businesses had struggled with its technical complexities, however, fundamental criticisms that the scheme is merely a tax remain. The Government will review the effectiveness of the simplified CRC Scheme in 2016.

Poor energy efficiency results in a number of social problems, including fuel poverty and ill health, as well as excess energy consumption which leads to high levels of energy-related environmental emissions; the policy context for these air pollutants is now well established. In light of these policy-drivers, this paper presents a cross-country analysis of housing conditions, energy-efficiency levels, affordability and satisfaction with housing in 14 European countries using longitudinal datasets from the European Community Household Panel for the years 1994-97. Very little empirical analysis of European housing conditions has been undertaken previously. The results indicate the existence of three main typologies in Europe as regards housing conditions, with serious housing deprivation in southern Europe, in terms of poor thermal efficiency, high fuel poverty, burdensome housing costs and low housing-satisfaction rates. In northern Europe, problems of damp and overcrowding are found, especially in the UK, Ireland, France and Belgium. The policy implications of these findings are outlined.

By the end of fiscal year 2000, the Office of Community Services had awarded $30 million in Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH) program grants to 24 states and 12 tribal organizations to fund 54 separate projects to help meet the home energy (heating and cooling) needs of low-income households. These grants ranged from $50,000 to $1.6 million. Most of the 54 REACH projects have educated low-income clients about home energy efficiency through group workshops or on individual home visits. Many REACH projects have involved energy-related repairs to homes and budget counseling, and three state REACH projects are developing consumer cooperatives to purchase electricity or bulk fuels, such as heating oil. However, some REACH projects have included social services not directly related to meeting home energy needs. The legislation authorizing REACH identifies the following three performance goals for individual REACH projects,  (1) reduce the energy costs of participating households, (2) increase the regularity of home energy bill payments, and (3) increase energy suppliers' contributions to reduce eligible households' energy burden. Of the six project evaluations completed by states as of May 2001, only one project's design and implementation allowed statistically valid conclusions to be made about the effect of project services on participant energy use. The five other state project evaluations had analytical problems and other shortcomings that limited their usefulness in assessing project results. The Department of Health and Human Services has not yet developed a comprehensive plan for how it can best communicate summary information on best practices and lessons learned from the REACH program.

A7ZZUZUX,journalArticle,2005,"Wells, Jim",Residential Energy: Oversight of Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program Payments: GAO-05-1039.,GAO Reports,,,,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=18377996&site=ehost-live,"The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program with recent annual funding of about $2 billion that provides fuel payment assistance and payments for home energy efficiency improvements for low-income households. As energy prices continue to rise, this assistance is growing more important to mitigate the impact of higher prices on low-income households. HHS awards LIHEAP funds by formula to all 50 states and the District of Columbia, federally or state-recognized Indian tribes and tribal organizations, and territories. These grantees then provide energy assistance payments to low-income households. Within LIHEAP, the Residential Energy Assistance Challenge Option (REACH) program funds demonstration projects to help low-income families reduce their energy usage. GAO was asked to provide information on (1) HHS's oversight of LIHEAP payments made by grantees and (2) GAO's 2001 review of LIHEAP's REACH program. HHS relies on individual grantees--the states, tribal organizations, and territories--to oversee the LIHEAP program. Because the Single Audit Act made state and local governments primarily responsible for obtaining independent audits of funds they receive from federal programs, HHS's principal oversight function is to monitor, not audit, LIHEAP payments made by grantees. Monitoring includes assessing the quality of single audits conducted under the act, reviewing audit results, and ensuring that corrective actions are taken to resolve audit findings. GAO's brief review of relevant 2004 Single Audit Act reports showed that the only LIHEAP costs that were specifically questioned involved relatively small sums--for example, one report cited incorrect or duplicate payments totaling $8,864. Another audit report questioned $1,285 in LIHEAP payments because of inadequate procedures to prevent overpayments. GAO's 2001 review of the REACH program found several projects that included social services that were not directly related to meeting home energy needs. For example, six projects included job skill or employment development services, and one project provided funds to help clients pay past-due rent or mortgage payments. In addition, the report stated that REACH did not have performance goals that were objective and quantifiable. As a result, GAO did not believe HHS could effectively evaluate the program's overall performance. The report also noted that such goals would provide a clearer basis for selecting individual projects to fund. GAO recommended that HHS develop performance goals for REACH that were objective, measurable, and quantifiable. While HHS agreed with this recommendation, GAO has been unable to identify any actions taken to implement this recommendation. According to HHS, the agency continues to work on the development of long-term performance measures for LIHEAP.

Household burdens vary significantly across and within countries, but in most cases they are regressive. Policymakers have mostly responded to the shock with broad-based price-suppressing measures, including subsidies, tax reductions, and price controls. Going forward, the policy emphasis should shift rapidly towards allowing price signals to operate more freely and providing income relief to the vulnerable. The surge in energy prices will encourage energy conservation and investments in renewable energy, but the manyfold rise in natural gas prices could lead to a persistent switch towards coal. To ensure steady progress towards carbon emissions reduction goals, authorities could use the opportunity to strengthen carbon pricing when global fossil fuel prices decline in the future.

Such a policy has two effects. At the intensive margin, a household that invests will choose a more efficient device. At the extensive margin, there will be more households that choose not to invest at all. Thus, additional to and different from rebound effects, energy-efficiency policy may have unintended consequences. I analyze the equilibrium effects of a minimum-efficiency standard, taking price adjustments and household heterogeneity into account. A moderate minimum-efficiency standard increases demand for efficiency-enhancing household capital goods, and reduces energy demand. More stringent policy is shown to be less effective or even counterproductive. For the case of a fixed supply of efficiency-enhancing capital, it is shown that minimum-efficiency standards increase equilibrium energy demand. Finally, I analyze which households benefit from minimum-efficiency standards and which ones lose. A standard induces investing households to expend more for household capital and less for energy.

Employing a theoretical matching model, we show that Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) that signal a dwelling's energy performance induce optimal EE investments by landlords only if tenants pay their energy expenditures in full. When landlords pay part of the energy expenditures, they seek tenants who will conserve energy. Our model shows that asymmetry of information over tenant characteristics results in suboptimally low investments in EE. This may even render EPCs counterproductive. As a remedy, we show that tenant-side signaling needs to be rolled out jointly with EPCs and may even be sufficient when contracts include energy expenditures. Data from an original survey provides support for these insights and suggests that information on the tenants' side contributes to more EE investment.

Multiple regression models are applied for the panel, to explain the electricity consumption of the corporate assets on a monthly basis and the total energy consumption on an annual basis. Using Generalized Additive Models, to model nonlinear covariate effects, the authors decompose the response variables into the implicit contribution of building characteristics, operational sales performance and energy management attributes, under control of the outdoor weather conditions and spatial–temporal effects.Findings METRO GROUP’s wholesale and hypermarket stores prove significant reductions in electricity and total energy consumption over the analyzed timeframe. Due to the implemented energy consumption and carbon emission reduction targets, the influence of the energy management measures, such as the identification of stores associated with the lowest energy performance, was found to contribute toward a more efficient corporate environmental performance.Originality/value In the context of corporate responsibility/sustainability of wholesale, hypermarket and retail corporations, the energy efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions from corporates’ real estate assets is of emerging interest. Besides the insights about the energy efficiency of corporate real estate assets, the role of the energy management, contributing to a more efficient corporate environmental performance, is not yet investigated for a large European wholesale and hypermarket portfolio.

Developers recognize that such “green labels” differentiate products and allow them to charge a price premium. China has not formally adopted such rating standards. In the absence of such standards, developers are competing with each other based on their own self-reported indicators of their buildings’ “greenness”. We create an index using Google search to rank housing complexes in Beijing with respect to their “marketing greenness” and document that these “green” units sell for a price premium at the presale stage but they subsequently resell or rent for a price discount. An introduction of a standardized official certification program would help “green” demanders to acquire units that they desire and would accelerate the advance of China’s nascent green real estate market.

Whether it's a company profile and job postings on LinkedIn, a Facebook page with tips about energy efficiency, or a Twitter stream disseminating information about recent outages, utilities are undeniably serious about adding digital real estate to their service territory. Yet even as the utility march towards Web 2.0 gathers momentum, the heavily regulated nature of the utility industry presents challenges in the naturally free-flowing world of social media. In addition to the traditional issues that all businesses face when engaging social media - from workplace concerns related to employee abuses of social media and appropriate discipline to copyright and IP protection - utilities must also ensure that their participation in social media does not run afoul of affiliate codes of conduct, SEC regulation, and a host of other compliance issues. This article provides an exhaustive summary of the legal and regulatory issues potentially implicated by utility engagement in social media, and proposes best practices and guidelines for development of a social media policy that reduce the risks of social media for utilities.

This paper investigates the existence and magnitude of the price premium associated with this official green label in the residential sector. Based on a unique data set of green-labelled, newly built housing projects and their non-labelled counterparts from around the country in 2013, an empirical analysis suggests that the labelled housing projects attract a price premium of 6.9% compared with their non-labelled counterparts. Further analysis suggests that this official green label is more effective as a reliable signal of buildings' energy efficiency in the Chinese context compared with developers' self-advertised 'greenness'. These results provide preliminary evidence that with this official rating system, the investment in buildings' energy-efficiency could be potentially profitable for housing developers in China, and such profitability may herald a rapid development of the green housing market in urban China.

Green buildings are no longer a niche market, being increasingly adopted due to their enlarged benefits, in both environmental and economic terms. Sustainable and ecofriendly architecture is the natural path for the housing sector to achieve balance and contribute to the overall sustainable development. For this reason, moving towards greener buildings must be immediate in a world relying upon scant earth extracted resources. Sustainable buildings produce environmental, social and economic benefits, as such, their patterns should be the norm instead of the exception. Shifting towards greener buildings is attractive to all players in the innovation ecosystem; as, these properties generate value for their owners, their users, and to the entire society. Indeed, several rating systems exist to assess the environmental performance of real estate, ranking their sustainability performance in terms of energy consumption. Energy performance certificates are among the most popular in Portugal. These certificates identify the property energy efficiency highlighting the strengths and the weaknesses in each component. Among the UE countries, EPCs were introduced by the Directive (2010/31/EU) in 2010, albeit with heterogeneous paces and slightly singular details in each member states. Being for consequence the core EU policy instrument to improve energetic performance of buildings to reach energetic sustainability. The empirical analysis relies on the evolution of the Portuguese certificate emissions in the time frame of 2014-2020 at the municipality level, proving that the greener transition in buildings has been asymmetrically addressed in the geography, further highlighting the asymmetries between seaside and countryside, and also big and small cities. Planning and building cities, disregarding their size, is critical for developing competitive and livable cities in which one may find energetic justice due to the smart use of energy sources allowing the entire community to access modern standards of living. However, this analysis has not been made so far, being neglected in extant literature. In doing so, we aim to shed light on the efficacy of the policy instrument as a seed of sustainable practices, but also on the promotion of territorial cohesion, which is a particularly hard problem to tackle by policy makers given the demographic and economic challenges of the present.

We employ data on primary market transactions in six newly developed multi-story condominiums--of which three are green and three are conventionally built--located in a single neighborhood of Netanya, Israel. We find that, after addressing the potential endogeneity between unit TTS and price, the average TTS of units in green, as compared to conventional, structures is significantly shorter. Considering developers' financing cost, this shorter TTS is equivalent to an indirect price premium of 1%-5%. We also find that whenever the indirect green premium associated with TTS decreases, the green quality-adjusted price premium increases. Thus, considering both price and TTS, we estimate a total green price premium of about 5%.",2018,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,33-58,,1,10,,Journal of Sustainable Real Estate,,,,,,,,,,,EconLit,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Sustainability; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Production Analysis and Firm Location: Government Policy R38; Environment and Development; Environment and Trade; Environmental Accounts and Accounting; Environmental Equity; Population Growth Q56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper evaluates whether policy incentives to invest now, instead of tomorrow can be tailored to compensate for any option value to defer. A case study reviews a Dutch government subsidy program with the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) binomial method. Based on market priced risk, the subsidy properly compensates investors for the real option value they forgo by exercising the option and investing in a solar hot water system. A survey amongst homeowners reveals that private risks are an important part of the perceived uncertainty when investing in energy efficiency and should be included in the model. A practitioners' method is proposed that uses a binomial real option model to design policy incentives and surveys to assess the relevant uncertainties to include in the model. The results displayed in strategy spaces makes intuitive decisions possible.",2010,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,161-181,,1,2,,Journal of Sustainable Real Estate,,,,,,,,,,,EconLit,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,Nonagricultural and Nonresidential Real Estate Markets R33; Energy: Demand and Supply; Prices Q41; Biodiversity Conservation; Bioeconomics; Ecological Economics: Ecosystem Services; Industrial Ecology Q57; Capacity G31; Capital Budgeting; Fixed Investment and Inventory Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6BH836FE,journalArticle,2015,"Michelsen, Claus; Neuhoff, Karsten; Schopp, Anne",Using Equity Capital to Unlock Investment in Building Energy Efficiency?,DIW Economic Bulletin,,21927219,,https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bsu&AN=102769057&site=ehost-live,"The energy transition will require considerable increases in energy efficiency, particularly in residential buildings. Financial support mechanisms, information and advice programs and dedicated training and certification of craftsmen are already in place to stimulate energy efficiency investment. Nevertheless, the required annual rate of thermal building refurbishment of around two percent is so far not achieved. For some real estate owners this may be explained by a investment horizon that is shorter than lifetime and repayment period of energy efficiency investment projects. The reluctance may also be due to an inadequate risk assessment by investors. Alternative financing approaches that rely mainly on the principle of coupling the revenues of the investment to actual energy cost savings and the increased involvement of equity capital might in such instances contribute to increasing investment activity. Particularly, in the current phase of low interest rates, there is more investment pressure on institutional investors whose willingness to participate in energy efficiency projects is likely to have increased substantially. Experience in other countries has however moderated expectations of being able to trigger greater short-term stimuli with innovative financial instruments. Nevertheless, given the challenges of the energy transition, further investigation of innovative financial concepts also based on equity funding seems warranted.
