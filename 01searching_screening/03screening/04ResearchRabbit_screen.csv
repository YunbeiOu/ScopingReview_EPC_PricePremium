10.1016/j.enpol.2013.11.054,,,The influence of the Energy Performance Certificate: The Dutch case,"All European Union Member States require an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) when buildings are constructed, sold and rented. At its introduction the EPC was considered a pioneering instrument, one that would help overcome an information deficit hindering consumer interest in energy efficient dwellings. Now that the EPC has been implemented for several years it is possible to examine its impact. This research draws on data from ex-ante and ex-post assessments of the EPC in a number of countries and presents the results of a survey of Dutch private dwelling purchasers. This survey was based on two sample populations, one received an EPC during property transaction and another did not. Differences were sought between the two samples in a number of areas relating to the adoption of energy efficiency measures. Results show that many projections about the impact of the EPC have fallen short. The EPC was found to have a weak influence, especially pre-purchase. The potential of the EPC in driving energy efficiency improvement in the existing stock is doubted especially if it continues to act independent from a mix of instruments designed to tackle multiple barriers. It is argued that the energy saving potential of existing dwellings, applauded in climate change policy, will remain unexploited if it continues to be assessed subjectively by householders.",Lorraine Murphy,Energy Policy,2014,0,,0,,0,out of scope,not price effect
10.1016/j.enpol.2012.01.064,,,The impact of energy performance certificates: A survey of German home owners,"The building sector accounts for about 40% of the final energy consumption in Germany. At the same time, the sector is regarded as one of the most cost-effective options for saving CO2 emissions. To target this potential, the European Union introduced energy performance certificates (EPC). EPCs should provide clear information about the energy performance of buildings to building purchasers, owners and tenants. This study analyses, in how far EPCs have helped purchasers of owner-occupied dwellings in Germany to incorporate energy efficiency in their purchasing decisions. The results suggest that the effectiveness of EPCs is limited. Main reasons are first, that the certificates are not helpful for understanding the financial implications of energy efficiency. Second, EPCs are not viewed for most buildings due to their legal status. Third, energy efficiency is only a minor purchasing criterion for dwelling purchases. The results of the study however also point to the potential of EPCs, as these barriers can be removed. From 2013 onwards the use of the EPC will be increased due to the new EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). Changes to the design of the EPC could further increase the importance of energy performance certificates and of energy efficiency.",Hermann Amecke,Energy Policy,2012,0,,0,,0,out of scope,stated preference (survey on WTP)

However, the market is confused by the different tiers of certification as evidenced by incommensurate premia for the different tiers. Furthermore, the fact that the premium varies with tenure (freehold/ leasehold) and location after controlling for all other attributes may imply that the premium may not be solely attributable to green certification.","Kwame Addae-Dapaah,Kwame Addae-Dapaah,Su Jen Chieh",,2012,0,,0,,0,not Europe,singapore

Real estate sale values in metropolitan Barcelona are analyzed using a hedonic model. The results suggest that moving from a G to an A rating increases the value by 5.11 %, equivalent to an average of 16.07 euros/m2/step (although there is an extra for grade A housing).This surplus is, in relative terms, much lower than in other European cities and, in absolute terms, less than the previously reported extra costs expended on improving the energy rating. In addition, the huge lack of energy rating information in the market seems to respond to a strategy to hide the poor rating of the building stock and aggravate the information asymmetry. All together overshadows the effectiveness of the European Energy Efficiency Directive as has been implemented in our country, and calls for its redesign.","C. Marmolejo Duarte,C.

10.1108/jerer-06-2016-0023,,,Is energy performance too taxing?: A CAMA approach to modelling residential energy in housing in Northern Ireland,"Over the past decade, there has been an increasing policy focus on improving the environmental performance of the housing stock. Following the Kyoto Protocol, the reduction of energy consumption attributable to buildings is a key Government policy objective. The housing sector has therefore observed a paradigm shift with increasing emphasis on energy efficient housing becoming a new orthodoxy. A side effect of this has been the mandate for ?€?compulsory?€? Energy performance certificates (EPCs) as new laws are promulgated relating to the need to conform with energy performance levels. As from 2018, all properties with EPC levels F and G will not be ?€?lettable?€? and this is likely to be extended to properties for sale. With increasing utility costs to customers, purchasers and authorities are becoming increasingly concerned with the running cost of properties and whether property energy improvements will be capitalized into sale value. Indeed, how energy efficiency is valued in the residential property market in terms of resale or appraisal value is a growing concern (McNamara, 2008; Sayce et al., 2010). Notwithstanding this, the relationship between energy performance and property value remains nebulous, complex and under-researched. In Europe, few studies investigate the effect of energy performance rating on residential property value with limited information and research in the UK and Northern Ireland context. This research uses hedonic analysis to investigate the relationship between EPCs and property sale price within the Belfast housing market. The findings show that there is a positive statistically significant relationship ?€? however, this is complex and subject to omitted variable bias and endogeneity problems. In addition, there appears to be a rural urban divide with regards to where policy should target. We further develop a multiplicative model (CAMA) to assess the energy performance of properties across NI using CO2 kg m2. The results show that introduction of a ?€?green?€? tax may indeed help foster behavioural change, but is in no way a panacea.","Peadar Davis,Michael McCord,William McCluskey,William McCluskey,Erin Montgomery,Martin Haran,John McCord",Journal of European Real Estate Research,2017,0,,0,,0,out of scope,not price effect (modelling EPC)

Over 15 million EPCs have been lodged, representing a valuable resource for research into the UK building stock. However, the EPC record has a reputation of containing multiple errors. In this work, we identify many such errors and quantify how common they are. We find that 27% of EPCs in the open EPC record display at least one flag to suggests it is incorrect and estimate the true error rate of the EPC record to be between 36 and 62%. Many of these errors are caused by EPC assessors disagreeing on building parameters such as floor type, wall type and built form. Additionally, flats and maisonettes appear to cause more issues than other property types. This may be due to difficulties in assessing their location in the building and the nature of the surrounding space. We also suggest potential new methods of quality assurance which rely on machine learning and which could allow such errors to be avoided in the future.","Alr Hardy,David Glew",Energy Policy,2019,0,,0,,0,out of scope,not price effect (criticism of EPC)
10.1016/j.rser.2019.109244,,,Review of building energy performance certification schemes towards future improvement,"Abstract   The building sector accounts for 40% of the total energy consumption in the EU. It faces great challenges to meet the goal of transforming the existing building stocks into near zero-energy buildings by 2050. The development of Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) schemes in the EU provides a powerful and comprehensive information tool to quantitatively predict annual energy demand from the building stock, creating a demand-driven market for energy-effective buildings. Properties with improved energy rating have had a positive impact on property investments and rental return because of the reduced energy bills. In addition, the EPC databases have been applied to energy planning and building renovations. However, it should be mentioned that the current evaluation system faces problems, such as not being fully implemented, delivering low quality and insufficient information to stimulate renovation, therefore requiring improvements to be made. This paper provides a review of the current EPC situations in the EU and discusses the direction of future improvements. The next generation EPC should rely on BIM technology, benefit from big data techniques and use building smart-readiness indicators to create a more reliable, affordable, comprehensive and customer-tailored instrument, which could better represent energy efficiency, together with occupants?€? perceived comfort, and air quality. Improved EPC schemes are expected to play an active role in monitoring building performance, future energy planning and quantifying building renovation rates, promoting energy conservation and sustainability.","Yu Li,Sylvain Kubicki,Annie Guerriero,Yacine Rezgui",Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews,2019,0,,0,,0,out of scope,not price effect

10.1016/j.eneco.2015.08.022,,,The role of information for energy efficiency in the residential sector,"Abstract   In spite of the large potential and existing efforts to foster energy efficiency in the residential sector, much remains to be achieved. This may be partially due to the many barriers and market failures faced by energy efficiency, which are even greater in this sector. In particular, informational failures seem to be pervasive and relevant in this area. Addressing these issues requires specific policy instruments and strategies. This paper reviews the empirical evidence on the effectiveness of such instruments, focusing on energy certificates, feedback programs, and energy audits. Results show that energy certificates and feedback programs can be effective, but only if they are carefully designed, whereas the evidence about the effectiveness of energy audits is mixed. In addition, the paper points out the large potential for new instruments as well as combinations of existing ones.","Ana Ramos,Alberto Gago,Xavier Labandeira,Xavier Labandeira,Pedro Linares",Energy Economics,2015,0,,0,,0,wider literature,

Design/methodology/approach - The research on the relationship between sustainability and market value in real estate is examined from the perspective of its usefulness to the valuation profession in providing guidance, information and evidence to be used in valuation practice. Findings - Existing research conducted into the relationship between sustainability and market value has not provided the valuation profession with evidence which would allow the incorporation of normative theories on the value of sustainability in valuation practice. This review highlights the lack of evidence, and the applicability of current research into sustainability and value to the valuation profession in providing guidance and information in valuing real estate incorporating sustainability. Practical implications - This paper highlights the limited applicability of research to date in regard to the relationship between sustainability and market value for the valuation profession. The lack of historical evidence, data or information on the quantifiable effects on market value of this new trend (sustainability), leaves the valuation profession uncertain as to the relationship between sustainability and market value. There is a probable risk of valuers interpreting strategic research incorrectly, and making inappropriate adjustments or comparisons because of their lack of knowledge and limited sustainability assessment skills. Although there is an evolving body of knowledge, there is a need for extensive analysis of unbiased, evidence-based research in individual and broader markets to provide guidance, evidence and knowledge of the implications of sustainability in the valuation of real estate. Originality/value - The examination of research investigating the relationship between sustainability and value from a valuation perspective provides an alternative insight into the applicability of current research in valuation practice. The increasing profile and role of sustainability in the real estate sector needs to be addressed in valuation practice; however, the variety of research to date needs to be interpreted by valuers in the correct context.

The lack of empirical support for the capitalization of neighborhood and accessibility effects may stem from the multicentric nature of the city as well as measurement problems with regard to neighborhood quality.

In order of significance of impact, these influential reference points were: the uncompleted contract price of a comparable property; the uncompleted contract price of the subject property; and the value opinions of other experts. This hierarchy of impact is consistent with both the degree to which each reference point is sanctioned by normative US training and the degree to which each reference point is generally available to US experts. Comparison with previous research suggests that market uncertainty as reflected by geographical unfamiliarity has a role in triggering reference point anchoring.","Julian Diaz,J.

The UK has recently introduced the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) as a signal of building energy performance. The aims of this article are: to evaluate how valid EPC?€?s are signals of occupier satisfaction with office facilities; and to understand whether occupant attitudes towards environmental issues have affected commercial office rental values. This was achieved by surveying occupant satisfaction with their workplaces holistically using a novel multi-item rating scale which gathered 204 responses. Responses to this satisfaction scale were matched with the corresponding EPC and rental value of occupier?€?s workplaces. The satisfaction scale was found to be both a reliable and valid measure. The analysis found that EPC asset rating correlates significantly with occupant satisfaction with all facility attributes. Therefore, EPC ratings may be considered valid signals of overall facility satisfaction within the survey sample. Rental value was found to correlate significantly only with facility aesthetics. No evidence suggests rental value has been affected by occupants' perceptions towards the environmental impact of facilities.","Aidan Parkinson,Robert De Jong,Alison Cooke,Peter Guthrie",Energy Policy,2013,0,,0,,0,Not residential buildings,office
10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.032,,,The price of energy efficiency in the Spanish housing market,"The housing sector is a substantial consumer of energy, and therefore a focus for energy savings efforts. The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) is the main EU policy to improve the energy performance of buildings. Following the implementation of the EPC Directive into Spanish law, from June 2013, all properties offered for sale or rented out in Spain are required to have an EPC. Given that this is a recently introduced regulation, unlike other European housing markets, the Spanish one lacks market data on energy efficiency (EE) labels and their impact on housing price. In order to overcome this gap, we determine the EE ratings of a sample of 1,507 homes across Spain on the basis of information collected previously through household surveys. This information allowed us to answer the question of whether or not, and to what extent, Spanish housing markets capitalise the value of EE. We apply the hedonic-price technique and observe that more energy efficient dwellings (meaning higher EE rating) have a price?premium between 5.4% and 9.8% compared to those with the same characteristics but lower EE level.","Amaia de Ayala,Ibon Galarraga,Joseph V.

One promising trend is the rise of homes labeled by a third party as ?€?green?€? or energy efficient. This paper documents evidence on the effects of providing information about the energy efficiency and ?€?sustainability?€? of structures in affecting consumer choice. We conduct a hedonic pricing analysis of all single-family home sales in California over the time period 2007 to 2012, and find that homes labeled with a green label transact at a small premium relative to otherwise comparable, non-labeled homes. We show evidence of spatial variation in this capitalization such that both environmental ideology and local climatic conditions play a role in explaining the variation in the green premium across geographies.","Matthew E.

Our results show that energy efficiency has a positive effect on both the sales and rental prices of properties, and that the effect is significantly stronger in the sales segment of the property market. We also analyse the effect of energy efficiency across different market conditions and we find that the effect of the energy rating is stronger where market conditions are worse.","Marie Hyland,Ronan C.

In this study, we evaluate the financial implications of two elements of ?€?sustainability?€? ?€? energy efficiency and accessibility ?€? in the market for commercial real estate. An empirical analysis of some 1100 leasing transactions in the Netherlands over the 2005?€?2010 period shows that buildings designated as inefficient (with an EU energy performance certificate D or worse) command rental levels that are some 6.5 percent lower as compared to energy efficient, but otherwise similar buildings (labeled A, B or C). Furthermore, this study shows that office buildings in multi-functional areas, with access to public transport and facilities, achieve rental premiums over mono-functional office districts. For policymakers, the results documented in this paper provide an indication on the effectiveness of the EU energy performance certificate as a market signal in the commercial property sector. The findings documented here are also relevant for investors in European office markets, as the importance of energy efficiency and locational diversification is bound to increase following stricter environmental regulation and changing tenant preferences.","Niels Kok,Maarten Jennen",Energy Policy,2012,1,0,0,,0,,office

Sustainable building characteristics, especially those which enhance the water efficiency, the health and comfort level and the building?€?s safety and security, have significant positive price effects.

As part of a wider objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, one of the policy aims of energy labelling of buildings is to provide information to market participants about assetsi energy performance in order to influence their demand. In turn, it is implied that demand shifts will have effects on prices, supply and, ultimately, on greenhouse gas emissions. Since they constitute the terms on which products are exchanged, prices are a fundamental element of markets and, whilst not always perfect, price signals are central to the operation of markets. Research on price effects is, therefore, central to identifying the effectiveness of this type of policy intervention. The study is based upon 708 commercial property assets held in the IPD UK Universe drawn from across all PAS segments.

In the second stage, the fixed effects estimated for each project are regressed on the location attributes of the projects, as well as control variables for a Green Mark rating. Our results suggest that the economic returns to green building are substantial. This is one of the first analyses of the economics of green building in the residential sector, and the only one analysing property markets in Asia. Our results provide insight about the operation of the housing market in one country, but the policy implications about the economic returns to sustainable investments in the property market may have broader applications for emerging markets in Asia.","Yongheng Deng,Zhiliang Li,John M.

10.1016/j.eneco.2018.04.041,,,Does voluntary disclosure create a green lemon problem? Energy-efficiency ratings and house prices,"This paper seeks to elucidate whether high levels of non-disclosure lead to adverse market outcomes in the form of the well-known lemons problem. It also empirically tests whether energy-efficiency ratings (EERs) are reflected in both housing sales prices and rents in the Australian Capital Territory, the only Australian housing market with mandatory ratings for all dwellings at point of sale or lease. Using a comprehensive dataset of sale and lease transactions during the period 2011?€?2016, a hedonic framework is applied. The analysis confirms that both the reported energy-efficiency levels and other sustainability-related characteristics that are not part of the formal rating assessment influence the pricing of both sales and rental transactions. Characteristics such as heating and cooling systems and the presence of solar power generators are significantly reflected in rents and sales prices, as tenants and buyers are likely to estimate their expected utility costs based on the EER. It is also shown that the option of leaving the EER of a rental property unreported presents a moral hazard for landlords of sub-standard properties, in that the likelihood of EER disclosure increases in line with the number of energy-efficient features of a property as revealed in the marketing material. The analysis also reveals that socio-economically disadvantaged areas suffer from disproportionately higher levels of EER non-disclosure, potentially constituting a ?€?double disadvantage?€? of non-disclosure and low?€?energy efficiency dwelling stock. From a market and asset-pricing perspective, it thus seems preferable to extend the requirement to obtain and present a valid EER to the rental market.","Franz Fuerst,Georgia Warren-Myers",Energy Economics,2018,1,0,0,,0,not Europe,Australia
10.1016/j.jjie.2016.01.003,,,Green luxury goods? The economics of eco-labels in the Japanese housing market,"Abstract   Using a unique transaction database of condominiums in the Tokyo metropolitan area and a hedonic analytical framework, we find that eco-labelled buildings command a small but significant premium on both the asking and transaction prices. This finding is consistent with results from other countries but in contrast to these studies, the present analysis also incorporates buyer characteristics which provide further information on the sources of demand for eco-labelled real estate. A separate estimation by subgroups reveals that the price premium is primarily driven by wealthier households that exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay for eco-labelled condominiums, both as a total amount and as a fraction of the total sales price. Less affluent households are also shown to pay higher prices for the eco label but the effect is less pronounced. The results indicate that capitalised utility bill savings are likely to account for a large proportion of the observed premium but the higher premium paid by affluent households suggests that more intangible benefits of living in a green building may also play a role.","Franz Fuerst,Chihiro Shimizu",Journal of The Japanese and International Economies,2016,1,0,0,,0,not Europe,Japan

10.1016/0094-1190(89)90043-0,,,Estimating the implicit price of energy efficiency improvements in the residential housing market: A hedonic approach,"Abstract   In this study a hedonic price model has been used to examine the impact which efficiency improvements have on housing values. Our study represents an improvement over a previous attempt to examine this issue in that the independent variable used in our analysis is designed to reflect variation in structural efficiency levels among sample homes, rather than variation in occupant lifestyles and preferences. In addition, a flexible functional form is used to prevent bias due to misspecification of the hedonic price equation.  The study results reveal that efficiency improvements are capitalized into housing prices in Des Moines, Iowa. At the average efficiency level of homes in the sample, an efficiency improvement which results in a $1 decrease in the level of expenditures necessary to maintain the house at 65 ?? F (in the average heating season) will increase the expected selling price of the house by $11.63. The premium obtained for an equivalent efficiency improvement will be greater than $11.63 in a relatively efficient home, and less than $11.63 in a relatively inefficient home.  Without further information concerning the price expectations and discount rates utilized by Des Moines home buyers, and the average remaining life of fuels saving investments in the sample, it cannot be determined whether the housing market is pricing fuel savings efficiently. Regardless of whether or not the implicit price of fuel savings is the outcome of an efficient market, information on this implicit price facilitates the estimation of an average resale value of fuel saving investments. In addition, the results of this study refute the hypothesis that efficiency improving investments are not capitalized into housing prices.","Terry M.

This paper analyzes the economics of ""green"" building. First, we analyze a panel of office buildings ""certified"" by independent rating agencies, finding that large recent increases in the supply of green buildings and the unprecedented volatility in property markets have not significantly affected the relative returns to green buildings. Second, we analyze a large cross section of office buildings, demonstrating that economic premiums in rent and asset values are substantial. Third, we relate the economic premiums for green buildings to their sustainability, confirming that the attributes rated for both thermal efficiency and sustainability contribute to premiums in rents and asset values. Even among green buildings, increased energy efficiency is fully capitalized into rents and asset values.","Piet Eichholtz,Nils Kok,John M.

Evidence from three U.S. cities,"Abstract   We test for evidence that energy efficiency features are capitalized into home prices in three U.S. metropolitan areas. Using hedonic regressions and multiple matching procedures, we find that Energy Star certification is associated with higher sales prices in two of the markets: the Research Triangle region of North Carolina and Portland, Oregon. We find that local ?€?green?€? certifications in Portland and in Austin, Texas, are also associated with higher prices and that the estimated price impacts are larger than those from Energy Star. Matching on observables proves to be important in some cases, reducing the estimated impacts compared with models without matching. We calculate the implied energy savings from the estimated premiums and find that, in the Research Triangle market, the Energy Star premiums approximately equal the savings that program is designed to achieve, but in Portland, the premiums are slightly greater than the program's savings due to low energy costs in the region.","Margaret Walls,Todd Gerarden,Karen Palmer,Xian Fang Bak",Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,2017,1,0,0,,0,not Europe,US
10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2013.09.015,,,Economic returns to residential green building investment: The developers' perspective???,"While many studies have shown that ?€?green price premiums?€? accompany the development of green buildings, there is still significant doubt among the public as to the financial viability of investments in energy efficiency. In this paper, we examine this issue from the developers' perspective, and draw on data from Singapore's Green Mark (GM) system, which was introduced in 2005 to evaluate the sustainability and energy-efficiency of buildings. We find that the ?€?green price premium?€? of residential developments arises largely during the resale phase, relative to the presale stage. The market premium of GM-rated units is about 10% at the resale stage, compared to about 4% during the presale stage. This implies that, while developers pay for almost all of the additional costs of energy efficiency during construction, they only share part of the benefits associated with such green investments. We also find no evidence that the development of green housing can immediately and significantly improve the corporate financial performance of Singaporean residential developers. These results provide the first evidence of the mismatch that developers face between outlays and benefits in the residential green building sector. This mismatch may impede further development of green residential properties. The emerging green real estate markets should be encouraged to introduce innovative business arrangements and financial products that allow residential developers to capture the future benefits associated with green properties.","Yongheng Deng,Jing Wu",Regional Science and Urban Economics,2014,1,0,0,,0,not Europe,singapore
10.1016/j.enpol.2011.08.005,,,The Impact of Energy Performance Certificates on the Rental and Capital Values of Commercial Property Assets,"This paper focuses on the effect of energy performance ratings on appraised capital values, rental values and equivalent yields of UK commercial property assets. The study is based on a cross-section of 708 commercial property assets. Incorporating a range of potential confounding factors such as unexpired lease term, vacancy rate and tenant credit risk, we use hedonic regression procedures to estimate the effect of EPC rating on rental and capital values. The study finds no evidence of a significant relationship between environmental and/or energy performance and rental and capital values. A small subset of 24 BREEAM-rated assets is also tested for significant price effects but a statistically significant effect is only confirmed for equivalent yields. Similarly, there was no evidence that the EPC rating had any effect on Market Rent or Market Value with only minor effects of EPC ratings on equivalent yields. The preliminary conclusion is that energy labelling is not yet having the effects on Market Values and Market Rents that would be expected if high EPC ratings were associated with substantial cost savings that are fully reflected in capital values and/or were readily available and taken into account by prospective tenants and buyers.","Franz Fuerst,Patrick McAllister",Energy Policy,2011,1,0,0,1,0,out of scope,commercial; UK
,,,Doing Well by Doing Good: Green Office Buildings,"This paper provides the first credible evidence on the economic value of the certification of ""green buildings"" -- value derived from impersonal market transactions rather than engineering estimates. For some 10,000 subject and control buildings, we match publicly available information on the addresses of Energy Star and LEED-rated office buildings to the characteristics of these buildings, their rental rates and selling prices. We find that buildings with a ""green rating"" command rental rates that are roughly three percent higher per square foot than otherwise identical buildings - controlling for the quality and the specific location of office buildings. Ceteris paribus, premiums in effective rents are even higher - above six percent. Selling prices of green buildings are higher by about 16 percent. For the Energy-Star-certified buildings in this sample, we subsequently obtained detailed estimates of site and source energy usage from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Our analysis establishes that variations in the premium for green office buildings are systematically related to their energy-saving characteristics. For example, an increase of ten percent in the site energy utilization efficiency of a green building is associated with a two percent increase in selling price - over and above the 16 percent premium for a labeled building. Further calculations suggest that a one dollar saving in energy costs from increased thermal efficiency yields roughly eighteen dollars in the increased valuation of an Energy-Star certified building.","Piet Eichholtz,Nils Kok,John M.

Our theoretical model demonstrates that the initial green premium can be negative but becomes positive as the building ages if a green building has a higher life-cycle cost and a longer economic life. Our empirical analysis of green condominiums in Tokyo confirms this prediction. We additionally find that the longer-life design is associated with a price premium, but the use of renewable energy and recycled materials and water is associated with price discounts. The price discounts are interpreted as the capitalization of a greater life-cycle user cost.","Jiro Yoshida,Ayako Sugiura",Journal of Real Estate Finance and Economics,2015,1,0,0,,0,not Europe,Japan
10.2139/ssrn.2472938,,,The Market Value of Energy Efficiency in Buildings and the Mode of Tenure,"Concerns about global warming and growing scarcity of fossile fuels require substantial changes in energy consumption patterns and energy systems, as targeted by many countries around the world. One key element to achieve such transformation is to increase energy efficiency of the housing stock. In this context, it is frequently argued that private investments are too low in the light of the potential energy cost savings. However, heterogenous incentives to invest in energy efficiency, particularly for owner-occupants and landlords, may serve as one explanation. This is particularly important for countries with a large rental sector, like Germany. Nevertheless, previous literature largely focuses on the pay offs owner-occupants receive, leaving out the rental market. This paper addresses this gap by comparing the capitalization of energy efficiency in selling prices (rents) for both types of residences. For this purpose data from the Berlin housing market are analyzed in hedonic regressions. The estimations reveal that energy efficiency is well capitalized in apartment prices and rents. The comparison of implicit prices and the net present value of energy cost savings/rents reveals that investors anticipate future energy and house price movements reasonably. However, in the rental segment, the value of future energy cost savings exceeds tenants' implicit willingness to pay by factor 2.98. This can either be interpreted as a result of market power of tenants, uncertainty in the rental relationship, or the ?€?landlord-tenant dilemma.""","Konstantin A.

An economic model is provided that considers lease rates and occupancy in simultaneous equilibrium. The behavior of both is predicted to be influenced by efficient design attributes. Selling price is determined by both rents and occupancy; therefore the impact of efficient design on commercial sales activity should be distributed through the leasing market. The model is tested empirically using a national sample of sales and leasing data for class A office buildings. The evidence indicates that ?€?green?€? buildings achieve superior rents and sustain significantly higher occupancy.

In parallel, many studies focused on estimating the economic benefits delivered by green buildings according to the consumer choices using specific econometric models. The study aims to investigate the awareness of the benefits deriving from Green Mark-labeled buildings in Singapore through the application of the hedonic pricing method. In particular, the impact of the Green Mark was assessed in the multi-family building sector, starting from a transaction dataset of approximately 300,000 units sold between 2005 and 2017. Given the spatial complexity of the multi-family buildings market, spatial autocorrelation models were recommended. In particular, the spatial lag model (SAR) and the spatial error model (SEM) were applied. The paper implements the property valuation literature in the field of spatial econometrics related to sustainable certification. Besides, the research provided an assessment of the sustainability scheme over time, highlighting consumer behavior in different phases of the real estate market in Singapore. The results highlighted how spatial models filter the autocorrelation effect. As for the impact of Green Mark on the sale price of the apartments, the results confirmed that a green premium exists.","Federico Dell?€?Anna,Marta Carla Bottero",Journal of Cleaner Production,2020,1,0,0,,0,not Europe,singapore

By mitigating informational asymmetries on real estate markets, the conventional wisdom is that they will reduce energy use, increase energy-efficiency investments, and improve social welfare. We develop a model that partly contradicts these predictions. Although EPCs always improve social welfare in the absence of market failures other than asymmetric information, their impact on energy use and investments is ambiguous and depends both on the time horizon considered and the distribution of energy needs in the population. This implies that, in a second-best world where energy externalities are under-priced, EPCs can damage social welfare.","Pierre Fleckinger,Matthieu Glachant,Paul-Herv?? Tamokou??
