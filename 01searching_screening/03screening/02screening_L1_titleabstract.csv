The analysis in this paper uses consistent controls and methods to investigate the valuation implication of green retrofits on residential transaction prices. We find that renovated properties in the sample of residential transaction prices are sold at price levels 5.8% higher on average than properties that are not renovated, all else equal. However, green retrofits sell for 9.9% higher on average than non-renovated properties, and green retrofits sell for about 12.7% higher on average than non-green renovated properties. It appears that investment in residential green building features is capitalized in housing prices.

This change in quality is a known, but rarely measured, factor. Our paper proposes a new framework to disentangle and quantify the contribution of each individual dwelling characteristic to the quality change. It can be applied to many frequently used hedonic house price indices and allows for non-linear, time-varying price premia for the various dwelling characteristics. Using data from Belgium for 2011 Q3 - 2021 Q2, we found that the quality of the houses sold increased substantially, mostly due to improvements in energy efficiency. As energy performance will continue to improve to meet European climate goals, statistical agencies should incorporate it into the construction of their house price indices in order to avoid overestimating price growth. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 14:38,,,,,123,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Energy efficiency; Housing market; Climate; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Global Warming Q54; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Construction L74; Hedonic regression; House price index; Quality adjustment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The findings suggest that a regulated carbon 'cap and trade' system could provide additional value to property owners who pursue EEI strategies. Moreover, carbon offset value differs significantly by geographic location and method by which electrical energy is produced.

However, higher investment costs are not conducive to the development of energy efficient buildings. It is not clear whether the energy efficiency of buildings (EEBs) bring price premiums that could offset the incremental costs of adopting green practice. In this paper, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is constructed that takes into account the differences in regional and urban size to measure the EEBs in 54 cities of China during 2007–2018. We evaluate the influence of EEBs on price premiums by using fixed effects regression. We then adopt a moderated mediation model to explore the impact of industrial structure and the regional economic development level on this premium effect. The empirical results show that the cities’ EEBs is gradually improving, due to the fact that the level of technical progress in residential construction is rising. A 1% increase in house energy efficiency causes price premiums of 0.583%. Moreover, this premium effect is more obvious in cities with a high proportion of tertiary industries and economically developed areas. Considering energy consumption in household heating, the housing prices expectations were pulled down in heating cities, while the situation was reversed in non-heating cities. This study provides companies and governments with scientific evidence to promote EEBs. © 2023",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 10:58,,,,,181,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Energy efficiency; Housing; Housing prices; Investments; Regional planning; Costs; Data envelopment analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Price premiums; Energy data; Energy efficiency of building; Energy efficiency of buildings; Energy efficient building; Housing price premium; Housing price premiums; Incremental cost; Industrial economics; Investment costs; Micro level; Moderating effect,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, there is a severe lack of research that investigates the effectiveness of the current format of EPC-labels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold: to study how households value energy efficiency in the housing market, regardless of price effects. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses multiple hedonic regression models to analyse 706,778 Flemish properties for sale or rent between 2019 and 2023. The data is provided by Immoweb – the largest online real estate platform in Belgium. Given that the selling market is driven by different mechanisms than the rental market, the data set was divided in sold (522,164 listings) and rented properties (184,614 listings). Findings: The ambiguous results of the A-label in the selling market indicate that the “class evaluation effect” found in related markets which use labels (e.g. household appliances) is also present in the housing market. However, the results of the other (lower) labels clearly show that owners do value energy improvements within labels, and this effect becomes stronger as the EPC-label becomes better. The rental market shows the opposite results. Energy improvements are only valued if they translate into a financial benefit. Taking these findings into account, the second part of this research shows that rescaling the EPC-label creates an incentive for improvements within labels. Originality/value: This paper provides novel insights by studying the perceived value of energy efficiency in the absence of financial benefits and critically studying the effectiveness of the EPC-labels in their current shape. By investigating both the sales and rental market, the authors are able to make a comparison which creates valuable insights for academia, governments and real estate professionals. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2024,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 10:59,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Energy efficiency; Housing market; Energy labels; Real estate efficiency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But what effect does sustainability have on property market values? A lot of discussion and research has already been undertaken to analyze possible impacts of sustainable characteristics on property values. Until now, little significant quantitative empirical evidence has been found, and if so, it s usually related to US real estate markets and the sustainability certifications of LEED and Energy Star. In 2002, the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) was adopted to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. The IMMOVALUE-project, granted by the program of Intelligent Energy Europe, analyzed the possibility of implementing characteristics of energy efficiency into property valuation practice using data from the mandatory energy-performance certificates. One result of the project was that if detailed property market data are available, multiple regression analysis in the framework of hedonic pricing models could be applied to consider, and empirically establish, the effects of energy efficiency characteristics on properties values. This article focuses on the possibility of integrating aspects of energy efficiency into income-related property valuation approaches.

I review the vast yet piecemeal research that has been carried out since. Focusing on energy efficiency in buildings, I organize the review around the concept of credence good: just like that of auto repairs or taxi rides, the quality of energy-efficiency measures is never fully revealed to the buyer; as a result, it is subject tomultiple information asymmetries. My first contribution is to distinguish symmetric-information problems from information asymmetries. The former arise when information is either incomplete or imperfect, but equally shared by contracting parties; as non-market failures, these can be addressed by technological progress and insurance markets. My second contribution is to give structure to the information asymmetries associated with energy efficiency by disentangling screening, signalling, moral hazard and price discrimination within a variety of contractual relationships involving buyers and sellers, owners and renters, borrowers and lenders, and regulators and policy stakeholders. I find evidence of information asymmetries to be compelling in utility-included rental contracts, unclear in home sales and rentals, and scarce in retrofit contracting and financing. I conclude by discussing the intricacies between informational and behavioural problems in energy-efficiency decisions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In Germany a large share of the residential building stock is rented. This comes with barriers to energy efficiency retrofitting due to split incentive problems. Alongside existing government incentive programmes, the German tenancy law allows landlords to add a maximum of 11% of the energy-related modernisation costs onto the annual rent. Studies evaluating the actual outcomes, from an energy as well as a social point of view, are rare. This article compares calculated theoretical heating energy consumption for prior to and after retrofit with actual consumption data after retrofit. Further, the issue of household expenses is addressed by comparing increased rental costs after retrofit with household's energy expenses prior and after retrofit. Despite a reduction in energy consumption of 70%, more than half of the households faced increased costs due to higher rents after retrofit. Even when increases in energy prices are taken into account, still one third of the households faced higher costs. For a fairer and more effective distribution of costs and benefits, this article stresses the importance of alternative financing models. Highlights • Tenants often do not profit from energy efficiency retrofits in financial terms. • Households with low energy consumption are disproportionately affected. • Alternative financing models are needed for more efficient and fair retrofit policies.

The present paper takes the analysis one step further. Using data on energy prices in combination with transaction data from Oslo, we conclude that not only the energy label, but also the energy performance of dwellings in general, has little to no effect on transaction prices.

Our results indicate that energy-rated homes sell faster than non-energy-rated homes, an effect that varies by 7-12 percent depending on model specifications and increases when positive (green) ratings are granted.

Policies to incentivize energy savings are however disparate between countries. Taking into account environmental aspects and consumer surplus, the paper uses a stylized economic model to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of three economic instruments: subsidies for renovation, subsidies for demolition and reconstruction projects and subsidies for building new houses on virgin land. The assessment also relates to differentiated value added taxes and other financial incentives such as green loans. In a counter-intuitive way, the model highlights that subsidies for renovations with minor energy gains worsen the overall energy consumption of housing due to the inducement of lock-ins with energy inefficient houses. Structural changes are needed in the use of policy instruments. First, commonly applied support schemes for renovations with minor energy savings should be abolished.

I examine one such policy and find increased capitalization of features that buyers are less likely to observe, but no impacts for features that buyers usually observe. A stan-dard deviation increase in less-observable energy efficiency corresponds to a $5,300 increase in house prices. A dollar of annual savings from less observable energy efficiency is associated with a $19 increase in house prices due to the policy. This trans-lates to none-to-full capitalization of less-observable energy efficiency at discount rates upward of 5.6%. My findings suggest that policy makers can reduce administrative burdens by targeting disclosure of less observable energy efficiency features. Further-more, my findings call into question the usefulness of common instruments like the Home Energy Score for disclosure policies, as these mostly provide information on more observable features. © 2023 The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 14:38,,655-686,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,capitalization; energy efficiency; Energy: Demand and Supply; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Housing Supply and Markets R31; mandatory information disclosure; observability of housing features; Prices Q41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In place since 2002, there is an EU directive mandating the introduction of an energy performance certificate (EPC) when selling detached houses. This directive was implemented in Sweden in 2009. We analyse how EPC capitalised on housing prices during 2012–2018 for detached houses in Stockholm. This was previously carried out, but our contribution is to analyse both the effect of energy rating or labelling (A–G) and energy consumption (kWh/m²). How energy performance is communicated or displayed to potential buyers conveys that the format, style, and content of energy performance information may influence how buyers perceive its value and impact on the property’s market price. We have information on energy rating, consumption, or both for selected properties. This allows us to test the hypothesis that how energy performance is presented affects pricing. We also tested whether information affects different age cohorts differently. The results indicate that how energy performance is presented and visualised is important and that information about rating and consumption might be considered as a substitute for each other. It is also clear that the capitalisation effect differs depending on the age of the building. © 2023 by the author.",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 11:00,,,,6,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,capitalisation; energy performance; energy rating; housing prices; labelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But in Germany the usefulness of this premium is confounded by the ‘prebound effect’: the gap between officially certificated energy ratings and actual energy consumption. Attempts have been made to close this gap from two complementary directions: downwards, by obtaining more accurate and less pessimistic technical estimates of idealised energy performance; and upwards, by estimating how much energy occupants realistically need for health and comfort. This study investigates prebound effects alongside an analysis of house prices in Germany, using a large database of house sale advertisements from 2007 to 2021, focusing on pre-1980 homes that were re-sold in 2019–2021. It uses ordinary least-squared multivariate regression to estimate market premiums for energy efficiency and sets these alongside estimates of prebound (and rebound) effects. It finds that prebound effects can lead purchasers to overestimate future energy savings and therefore pay more for properties than their actual worth. It also offers simple models to help purchasers interpret energy ratings more critically and estimate likely energy savings more realistically. Finally, it suggests how policymakers could modify energy ratings to reflect likely energy consumption more accurately. © 2023 The Author(s).

Design/methodology/approach: The adoption of home green energy efficiency upgrades has emerged as a new trend in the real estate industry, offering several benefits to builders and home buyers. These include tax reductions, health improvements and energy savings. Previous studies have shown that energy-certified single-family homes command a premium in the marketplace. However, the literature is limited in its analysis of the effects of green upgrades and certification on different types of single-family homes. To address this gap, this research collected data from 21,292 multiple listing services (MLS) closed home-selling listings in Austin, Texas, over a period of 35 months. Findings: The analysis results showed that green efficiency features could generally increase single-family housing prices by 11.9%, whereas green sustainability upgrades can potentially bring a 11.7% higher selling price. Although green housing certification did not have significant effects on most housing groups, it did increase closing prices by 13.2% for single-family residences sold at the medium price range, which is higher than the impacts from simply listing the green features on MLS. Originality/value: The study contributes to the body of knowledge by examining the market value of broadly defined energy efficiency and sustainability features in the residential housing market. The findings can help policymakers, brokerage firms, home builders and owners adjust their policies and strategies related to single-family home sales and mortgage approvals. The research also highlights the potential benefits of capitalizing on green housing features other than certifications. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 11:00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Housing markets; Residential property; Sustainability,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study addresses this gap using a visual choice experiment to sample 1538 intended homebuyers in the USA, and the preference for home attributes through a simplified real estate website. Each home presented on the website featured six attributes: price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage, number of days on the market, energy efficiency, and a photo — each relative to participants’ initial specification of location, preferred price, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The respondents were assigned to one of six experimental conditions where energy information was provided as (i) estimated annual energy costs, (ii) home energy score (number only), (iii) home energy score along a continuum, (iv) estimated annual energy costs and energy score along a continuum, (v) home energy scores provided for only above average homes, and (vi) no energy information provided (control). We find that homebuyers are more likely to select energy efficient homes when presented with any form of energy efficiency information, with conditions that include home energy scores providing the greatest increase in energy efficiency. Furthermore, this preference for energy efficiency information persists even under less-than-ideal home searches. The preference for energy efficient homes is influenced by type of home and region with detached homebuyers and homebuyers in the Midwest US Census region more likely to select homes featuring higher energy efficiency scores. Finally, we find that rural homebuyers are more likely to prefer energy efficient homes over urban homebuyers. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",2024,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 11:00,,,,1,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Annual energy costs; Choice experiments; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; discrete choice analysis; Discrete choice experiment; Discrete choice experiments; Energy; energy efficiency; Energy efficiency; Energy efficient homes; Energy information; experiment; Home energy efficiency; Homebuyer preference; Homebuyer preferences; homeownership; Housing; housing market; Housing market policy; Housing markets; Midwest; United States; Websites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even when a certificate is available, landlords do not always disclose it. This contradicts the unraveling result, according to which all landlords should disclose quality information unless it is costly to do so. We leverage a cross-sectional dataset of residential rental advertisements from the Belgian region of Brussels to empirically evaluate incentives to disclose an EPC. We find that two fundamental assumptions for the unraveling result are not confirmed in our setting: tenants value energy performance of rental property only when dwellings are of very high quality and do not appear to rationally adjust their expectations when faced with dwellings that withhold their EPC.

We test this hypothesis by specifying a hedonic price model reflecting a total-cost-of-renting perspective. Drawing on 844,229 apartment listings for rent from 2014 to 2020 on a small spatial scale, we find a premium for more energy-efficient apartments; however, it is rather small. If the energy performance score decreases by 10 kWh/m2a, the monthly basic rent increases, on average, by roughly €0.01 per square meter living area. The expected energy cost savings thereby exceed the premium by a factor of three to seven. Rather, we find discounts of up to 9.2 % if apartments use heating technologies that are known to be inefficient. We explore various explanations for these outcomes, considering both landlord and renter behavior. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 14:38,,,,,183,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Apartment houses; Apartment leasing & renting; Apartments; building; Commerce; Competitive forces; Energy consumption; energy efficiency; Energy efficiency; Energy industries; energy market; Force behavior; Germany; heating; Heating technology; Hedonic analysis; housing market; Housing market; Housing markets; Prospectives; Rational behaviours; Rental housing; Rental market; rental sector; Residential building; Residential buildings; residential energy; Valuation gap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Germany, however, is underperforming in its emissions reduction goals. There is still room for improvement, especially in the building sector – but this is often associated with high upfront investments. There is evidence that the market for energy efficiency in the German rental housing market is inefficient, resulting in underinvestment. To investigate these inefficiencies, this study estimates a hedonic pricing model combined with a total-cost-of-use perspective based on the observation of warm rents for a sample of 3,903,473 rental offers from 2014 to 2021. In a “perfect world”, the effect of the energy performance score given in energy performance certificates as an indicator of energy consumption or demand, respectively, is expected to be zero, as corresponding costs are already included in the warm rent. If the coefficient is significantly different from zero, it can be interpreted as measure for inefficiencies. The study further investigates whether disclosing heating costs in real estate advertisements could lead to a better appreciation of energy efficiency in the rental market and thus contribute to closing the information gap. Results show that the market for energy efficiency is indeed inefficient; however, the disclosure of full information can help to overcome these inefficiencies. These results lead to several important policy implications. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 11:01,,,,,312,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Buildings sector; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Emission reduction; Energy efficiency; Energy performance; Energy transitions; Energy utilization; Hedonic pricing; Housing markets; Information asymmetry; Investments; Political agenda; Public policy; Renewable energies; Rental housing market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a novel dataset, we analyse over 5 million residential property sale transactions in England and Wales, each containing information about sale price, property and location characteristics, and a mandatory energy performance certificate (EPC). The EPC includes a continuous energy cost rating (SAP rating) which is mapped into seven colour-coded rating bands (ranging from green A to red G). Applying a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD), we document significant price discontinuities at the rating band thresholds. We estimate that--holding the underlying SAP score equal--being in a higher rating band increases the final sale price of a property between 0.8% and 2.5% ($2,000 and $6,625 based on average sale prices) depending on the threshold crossed. The presence of price discontinuities suggests that individuals are attentive to the simpler colour-coded rating band and partially inattentive to the more precise SAP rating. We present a simple model for estimating the degree of inattention and show that, for a given level of attention, rating bands reduce attention to the SAP rating by 25% on average. Importantly, the detected price discontinuities appear to influence market behaviour: Sellers whose property receives an EPC rating just below a threshold to the next-higher rating band are between 0.4% and 11% more likely to make last-minute EE investments before placing their property on the market. We discuss a number of recommendations of how to best leverage these threshold effects to improve policy design, which can be extended to other settings where the provision of simplified information creates reference thresholds.",2020,18/03/2023 17:46,18/03/2023 17:46,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EconLit,Availability Note: Information provided in collaboration with the RePEc Project: http://repec.org,EBSCOhost,,"Publisher: CESifo, CESifo Working Paper Series: 8669",,,,"Belief; Communication; Consumer Economics: Empirical Analysis D12; Energy: Government Policy Q48; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Information and Knowledge; Information and Product Quality; Learning; Search; Standardization and Compatibility L15; Unawareness D83; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand R21",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reports on a recently completed empirical study for the Swiss residential sector. It empirically quantifies the marginal costs of energy efficiency investments (i.e. additional insulation, improved window systems, ventilation and heating systems and architectural concepts). For the private sector, first results on the economic valuation of co-benefits such as improved comfort of living, improved indoor air quality, better protection against external noise, etc. may amount to the same order of magnitude as the energy-related benefits are given. The costbenefit analysis includes newly developed technologies that show large variations in prices due to pioneer market pricing, add-on of learning costs and risk components of the installers. Based on new empirical data on the present cost-situation and past techno-economic progress, the potential of future cost reduction was estimated applying the experience curve concept. The paper shows, for the first time, co-benefits and cost dynamics of energy efficiency investments, of which decision makers in the real estate sector, politics and administrations are scarcely aware.

In the era of energy conservation, which results from environmental requirements, as well as from constantly increasing energy prices, the energy consumption of premises and buildings becomes an important prerequisite for decision-making processes in the real estate market. There have also been changes in the provisions of the Act on Real Estate Management, which impose an obligation on the professional group of property appraisers to incorporate energy performance certificates for buildings and premises into the valuation process. Energy intensity in terms of the demand for heating of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units.Purpose: The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high-rise buildings) and the diverse distribution of units in the building, especially with regard to their exposure to the different point of the compass. The research covered the Słoneczne housing estate in Szczecin, in a situation where the property appraiser does not have access to the energy performance certificates of the estimated apartments as well as apartments taken for comparison. The aim of the study is to identify the relationship between energy intensity and market value of residential units on the selected real estate market. The analysis will be based on data from the Price and Value Register of the County Office, a collection of statistics and public information as well as on the authors’ own databases and research.Research methodology: A multidimensional analysis will be used to distinguish homogeneous groups of residential units due to their property attributes. The study will also employ a valuation model including energy intensity and time variables.Results: The study showed that building type is one of the features determining energy consumption by a building. Depending on the period, the introduced attributes explained the evolution of the unit price at 78%, 75% and 24%. The parameters of the variables Size, Neighborhood and Time were found to be statistically significant. What is more, in all three periods, the value of the residential unit was significantly affected by the type of building which determined the energy performance of the building.Novelty: Energy intensity in terms of the heating demand of multi-family residential buildings will be the basis for the assessment of its impact on the market value of residential units. The article analyses the energy intensity of different types of buildings (e.g. low and high buildings) and the different location of units in a building, especially in relation to the directions of the world.",2020,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:55,,117-132,,1,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Energy consumption of buildings; energy intensity; Energy: Demand and Supply; Housing Supply and Markets R31; market value; Market value; Marketing models; Prices Q41; Real estate management; Real estate market analysis; Real property; Szczecin (Poland),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We exploit variation in technologies that houses are locked into at construction time to identify the stand-alone value of having a cost-saving technology in the house. For the two main technologies, electric and district heating, the estimated price discount is 5-6% of the house value for electric heating, coming very close to the capitalized value of the cost differential obtained from external data on energy contract prices.

An important question for Germany and other countries is, what minimum energy efficiency standard should be mandated for housing retrofits so as to reduce CO2 emissions economically efficiently? It has long been known that the marginal costs of energy efficiency increase as standards are pushed higher, and therefore the marginal costs of CO2 abatement increase, but at the same time energy consumption reduces, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. This paper investigates where the social optimum lies between these two effects. In addition to a large database of house sale advertisements containing price and energy efficiency data, it uses two semi-official data sources of modelled and actual energy efficiency upgrades in Germany. It finds that retrofitting to a modestly high standard of about 70 kWh/m2/y entails marginal costs of CO2 abatement comparable to current CO2 prices. However, each step to a higher standard increases these by up to an order of magnitude, with absurdly high marginal costs of CO2 abatement for the highest standards. German policymakers are currently pushing for higher minimum standards, but money could better be spent retrofitting more houses to less stringent standards. © 2023 The Author",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 11:01,,,,,237,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,abatement cost; Abatement costs; building; carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; CO2 abatement; CO2 abatement cost; CO2 emissions; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decarbonising; Decarbonising the residential buildings stock; Decarbonizing the residential building stock; energy efficiency; Energy efficiency; Energy efficiency renovation; energy use; Energy utilization; environmental economics; Germany; Germany'S climate goal; Germany'S climate goals; Housing; Marginal costs; Retrofitting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus of this viewpoint is on how incentives for improving energy efficiency are affected by pricing principles in two specific areas: housing rents and district heating fees. Many countries have regulations that affect how housing rent is determined. It has been shown that cost-based rents reduce incentives for energy efficiency. The same may occur if rent is related to qualities of the apartment, if these qualities do not include the indoor climate. There have been concerns that district heating companies might respond to lower sales by increasing prices, thus reducing any incentive to reduce energy consumption. It is argued that this will not happen if fixed and variable fees correctly reflect the cost structure. Empirical studies show that it is common to have a variable fee that is higher than the marginal cost, partly because of monopoly elements in the market. This type of pricing will actually strengthen the incentives for energy efficiency investments compared to theoretically correct pricing principles.

The question arises as to who should pay for these social benefits: tenants, property owners, or society? The issues are complicated by the fact that the direct costs and benefits of energy-efficiency renovation are influenced by real estate markets. These market effects need to be better understood so that social costs, subsidies and CO2 taxes can be more fairly apportioned. As a case study, this paper investigates sales and rental market premiums for energy efficiency in 2019–2021 among the 6 million apartments in Germany that were built in 1800–1945, using a database from Germany's largest real estate portal. These apartments are notoriously energy inefficient, and their architecture and elegance can make energy-efficiency retrofitting difficult and expensive. Using least squares regression analyses, it finds that sales premiums for energy efficiency generally compensated owners who retrofitted then sold, were too low to compensate landlords/landladies for retrofitting, and too high for tenants or purchasers to offset through reduced energy consumption. The study asks how subsidies or CO2 taxes could help correct these market anomalies. Market premiums vary greatly by geography, suggesting that subsidies or taxes would need to vary by region. The relative stability of construction and energy prices in 2019–2021 make this a useful study of how different factors can interact to influence market premiums and set parameters for social subsidy and tax interventions. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 14:38,,,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,"Climate; Energy: Demand and Supply; Environmental Taxes and Subsidies H23; Germany's pre-War apartments; Global Warming Q54; Health Behavior I12; Health: Government Policy; Housing Supply and Markets R31; Market premiums for energy efficiency; Natural Disasters and Their Management; Prices Q41; Public Health I18; Redistributive Effects; Regulation; Social benefits of energy efficiency; Space heating energy efficiency; Taxation and Subsidies: Externalities; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand R21",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the vast majority of previous studies that have focused on the price effects of ecolabels, this study investigates the effects of individual sustainability attributes. Overall, we find a positive relationship between the environmental performance of residential buildings and their rental levels. Sustainable building characteristics, especially those which enhance the water efficiency, the health and comfort level and the building's safety and security, have significant positive price effects.

Policy makers are increasingly concerned about this energy efficiency gap. In this paper, we investigate the energy investments made and the market efficiency gains associated with different policy interventions at the point of lease. We introduce key features of the housing rental market in the laboratory and examine four policy options: mandatory information on energy efficiency, voluntary information, mandatory minimum standards, and a 'cost-share' treatment (i.e., landlords pay a share of the tenants' energy bill). We find that enabling landlords to post the energy efficiency of their properties increases investment in energy efficiency. Voluntary information achieves efficiency levels comparable to those under a mandatory programme but may lead to lower levels of tenant participation. Mandatory minimum standards lead to higher investments in energy efficiency, but also reduce the number of properties available for lease. Cost-sharing leads to low market efficiency levels, perhaps due to the uncertainty landlords face regarding the energy bill of their tenants.

At the extensive margin, there will be more households that choose not to invest at all. Thus, additional to and different from rebound effects, energy-efficiency policy may have unintended consequences. I analyze the equilibrium effects of a minimum-efficiency standard, taking price adjustments and household heterogeneity into account. A moderate minimum-efficiency standard increases demand for efficiency-enhancing household capital goods, and reduces energy demand. More stringent policy is shown to be less effective or even counterproductive. For the case of a fixed supply of efficiency-enhancing capital, it is shown that minimum-efficiency standards increase equilibrium energy demand. Finally, I analyze which households benefit from minimum-efficiency standards and which ones lose. A standard induces investing households to expend more for household capital and less for energy.

An estimate of the avoided costs of air pollution is also included. The overall economic impact assessment is based on an input-output methodology. From the point of view of individual investors, the benefits in terms of reduced future expenses related to energy products are usually below energy efficient renovation investment costs, making an investment financially viable only if government support is provided. If the benefits for society as a whole are included, energy efficient renovation could be assessed as viable even in the short-run. Energy saving retrofits of residential and public buildings positively contribute to economic growth, employment and protection of the environment. Because of economic growth, the tax revenues induced by these investments could compensate for government expenditures, and the overall impact on the public deficit is expected to be neutral even in the short-run.

Although most of these regulations concern the housing stock, office buildings are also a considerable source of greenhouse gas emissions. Office markets face fewer pricing regulations than the residential market and may thus provide a clearer pricing signal of any policy impacts. This paper focusses on the introduction of Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) in England and Wales. Applying machine-learning methods, Difference in Differences (DiD) and Fixed Effects (FE) panel data estimation to a comprehensive database of the London office market, our results suggest that the MEES policy has had a measurable and significant impact and lowered the rents of the combined group of affected office units by 6–8% following the announcement of MEES and in the run-up to implementation. A weakly significant 4.4% rental discount is detected for the bordering but unaffected class of EPC E-rated office buildings relative to the A–C EPC group, perhaps due to market expectations of a further expansion of MEES. © 2023 The Authors",2024,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 14:38,,,,,185,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Building energy efficiency; climate change; Climate change; Commerce; Commercial real estate; Costs; energy efficiency; Energy efficiency; Energy efficiency standards; England; Gas emissions; Government policy on climate change; Greenhouse gases; Housing; housing market; Laws and legislation; Learning systems; Minimum energy; Minimum energy efficiency standard; Minimum energy efficiency standards (MEES); Office buildings; policy analysis; Policy evaluation; Price regulation; Real estate market; Real estate pricing; Real estate sales; Real-estates; regulatory approach; Residential mobility; United Kingdom; Wales,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, interestingly, the limited studies that address the rental market find significantly lower price premiums than the sales market. The purpose of this paper is to add to this literature, by doing a comparative analysis of price premiums in the sales and rental market in Flanders (Belgium). Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a hedonic regression model to analyze 177,670 real estate listings between 2016 and 2021. The data is provided by Immoweb – the largest online real estate platform in Belgium. The data set was divided in sold and rented properties: the authors evaluated 126,217 sales listings and 51,453 rent listings. Findings: The results confirm that energy efficient properties generate a price premium, but that this premium is significantly larger in the sales market than in the rental market. In addition, the findings indicate that both investors and landlords could benefit strongly from renovating dwellings – especially when renovating from an F label to an A label. Originality/value: Previous research focuses strongly on the sales market, although in many countries the rental market is similar in size and responsible from much energy consumption. Interestingly, the few studies that are addressing the rental market, find singificantly smaller price premiums than in the sales market. The findings add to this literature tradition and offer a comparative analysis of price premiums in the sales and rental market in Flanders. This allows us to not only show the similarities between both markets but also highlight the differences – creating valuable insights for academia, governments and real estate professionals. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2023,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 11:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Energy efficiency; Energy labels; EPC; Housing market; Price premiums; Real estate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use a sample of 585,578 residential properties in the Republic of Ireland - a region that legally requires rental properties to display energy performance certificates when advertised. The findings suggest that the landlord-tenant problem is present in the Irish rental market but that it is not uniform across locations, indicating the influence of other factors. To explore this further, we exploit the regional variation in rental property prices. We find a larger difference between rental and non-rental properties' energy efficiency in markets with scarcity in rental property supply. In addition, we are able to take advantage of a unique trait in building design to compare rental and non-rental properties which were identical at the time of their construction.

Alternatively, using the Building Energy Rating metric, a 1-point improvement in the 15-point scale from G to A1 yields a list price increase of 1 %.

One of these strands focuses on the role played by building energy features in shaping property prices. Indeed, market players are expected to show a higher willingness to pay for building units characterized by higher energy performance. The study of the so-called price premium for building energy efficiency has flourished in the last decade or so; plenty of evidence is now available concerning its occurrence, although its magnitude is still debated. The literature relies on the methodological frameworks of statistical modeling and multiple regression, primarily employing hedonic price models. Lately, spatial autoregressive models have also been adopted. Here, we propose to deal with estimation of the price premium by adopting an innovative perspective. In particular, we use a methodological framework in which regression models are complemented with a multi-criteria optimization approach. Using a spatial autoregressive model first, and with D as the reference energy rating band, we find the following price premiums: 55% for A4, 42% for A3 to A, 20% for B or C, -14% for F, and -29% for G. The multi-criteria optimization approach proves efficient in estimating the price premium. The estimates above are essentially confirmed: the results converge for all the energy rating bands except for G.",2023-02,02/05/2024 10:52,02/05/2024 10:52,27/03/2023,,,2,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000944676500001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the opinion of qualified real estate agents, this paper explores whether, in Spain, EPC labels play any role in housing marketing, as well as the policy changes required to foster efficient dwellings. The results reveal a large misunderstanding of the EPC labels, since they are seen as a global home-quality indicator, while their impact on residential marketing is quite poor. Apparently, both supply and demand place a small interest in energy performance, although it is slightly larger for sellers/buyers in relation to lenders/tenants. In any case, EPC labels are far from blurring the energy information asymmetry, since most of the buyers/tenants are informed of the EPC rating after having selected their home. Overall, the EPC scheme has a poor reputation exacerbated by inaccuracies, unintelligible units to express the financial and environmental implications of energy efficiency, and an apparent weak supervision. These findings stress the need to improve the scheme; in doing so, realtors suggest the need for some companion policies.",2020-02,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,,,2,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000519946700017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also analyse the effect of energy efficiency across different market conditions and we find that the effect of the energy rating is generally stronger where market conditions are worse.

A case study reviews a Dutch government subsidy program with the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) binomial method. Based on market priced risk, the subsidy properly compensates investors for the real option value they forgo by exercising the option and investing in a solar hot water system. A survey amongst homeowners reveals that private risks are an important part of the perceived uncertainty when investing in energy efficiency and should be included in the model. A practitioners' method is proposed that uses a binomial real option model to design policy incentives and surveys to assess the relevant uncertainties to include in the model.

Superior energy efficiency is the basis for value disparities in real estate markets. However, measurements of these variations vary significantly. This research aims to investigate the relationship between market size and vitality and market value differences. This has significant implications for the nature of the energy transition, potentially determining fairness or inequality. The study considers the real estate market in six Italian cities: three metropolitan (Milan, Turin, and Florence) and three medium-sized cities (Padua, Mestre, and Bergamo). The sample includes 2935 properties. In metropolitan cities, hedonic pricing models confirm the relevance of energy performance in market value formation, highlighting a potential depreciation in property values by up to 30% between properties belonging to the highest energy class (A) compared to the lowest (G), and 14% between class D and G. Such premium gaps are halved in medium-sized cities. Conclusions foresee a scenario of socially and economically unjust transition that must be considered in policies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings, with a specific concern for the nature and characteristics of the real estate markets involved. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,02/05/2024 10:51,02/05/2024 11:03,,,,2,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Bergamo; built environment; energy efficiency; energy market; energy resource; energy transition; Firenze [Tuscany]; Florence [Firenze]; hedonic prices; Italy; Lombardy; Milan [Milano]; Milano [Lombardy]; Padova; Padua; performance assessment; Piedmont [Italy]; price dynamics; real estate market; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin; Tuscany; unjust transition; urban development; Veneto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Financial support mechanisms, information and advice programs and dedicated training and certification of craftsmen are already in place to stimulate energy efficiency investment. Nevertheless, the required annual rate of thermal building refurbishment of around two percent is so far not achieved. For some real estate owners this may be explained by a investment horizon that is shorter than lifetime and repayment period of energy efficiency investment projects. The reluctance may also be due to an inadequate risk assessment by investors. Alternative financing approaches that rely mainly on the principle of coupling the revenues of the investment to actual energy cost savings and the increased involvement of equity capital might in such instances contribute to increasing investment activity. Particularly, in the current phase of low interest rates, there is more investment pressure on institutional investors whose willingness to participate in energy efficiency projects is likely to have increased substantially. Experience in other countries has however moderated expectations of being able to trigger greater short-term stimuli with innovative financial instruments. Nevertheless, given the challenges of the energy transition, further investigation of innovative financial concepts also based on equity funding seems warranted.

Based on a German rental apartment dataset from Q1 2007 to Q1 2019, we use interaction terms for socioeconomic characteristics in a hedonic regression model. We find that rents are lower for apartments with higher energy consumption, even in neighborhoods with lower levels of green awareness. This relationship is stronger in neighborhoods with higher purchasing power, such that communities with low levels of green awareness and high purchasing power show the steepest negative slope for increasing energy consumption (−8.6% from the highest to lowest rating). Thus, the rent-decreasing effect of purchasing power is higher than that of green awareness. Splitting the entire period into smaller windows, we find that the interaction effect of green awareness has emerged in the most recent years (2017–2019). This may be driven by changes in regulation, which have made it easier for tenants to assess the energy consumption before they rent, or by a general increase in green awareness over this period.",2021-02,18/03/2023 17:45,18/03/2023 17:45,,220-241,,2,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
